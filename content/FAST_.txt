overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first branch in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 26000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers through a branch network in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines how we engage with our customers has similarly evolved to include onsites fastenal managed inventory and ecommerce we provide additional descriptions of our product lines and market channels later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2021 we had 3209 inmarket locations defined in the table below in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in north america 12 in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and one in europe and we employed 20507 people we believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement 

our channels to market 

we engage our customers primarily through branch and onsite locations branches and onsites exist very close to our customers usually within miles in the case of the former and most often within or immediately proximate to our customers physical locations in the case of the latter and together constitute our inmarket network many of our customers engage with us through ecommerce but most of our sales through this channel are with customers that use ecommerce to supplement our service through our other channels 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each of the last ten fiscal years the number of branch onsite and total inmarket locations at the end of each of the last ten fiscal years their respective sales as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and onsite locations and our revenue generated from nontraditional sources 



1 revenues attributable to our traditional and international branch locations and our onsite locations respectively 

2 average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and onsites respectively in the given year factoring in the beginning and ending location count divided by total revenues attributable to our branch and onsite locations further divided by twelve months respectively this information is presented in thousands 

3 onsite information prior to 2014 is intentionally omitted while such locations have existed since 1992 we did not specifically track their number until we identified our onsite program as a growth driver in 2014 

4 this portion of revenue is generated outside of our traditional inmarket location presence examples of which include revenues arising from our custom inhouse manufacturing industrial services leased locker arrangements and other nontraditional sources of revenue the significant increase in other revenue in 2020 largely reflects the onset of the covid19 pandemic in that period and the substantial sales of pandemicrelated products that we directshipped versus selling through our inmarket locations as a means of delivering critical supplies more quickly the decline in other revenue in 2021 largely reflects the absence of such directshipped revenue as the supply chain for such products stabilized 

5 inmarket locat ions is defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of onsite locations 

this structure has evolved over time as a result of one of fastenals guiding principles since inception that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer this has been achieved by opening branch locations and more recently onsite locations today we believe there are few companies that offer our north american inmarket location coverage in 2021 roughly 52 of our sales and 50 of our inmarket locations were in major metropolitan statistical areas msas populations in the united states and canada greater than 500000 people while 21 of our sales and 19 of our inmarket locations were in small msas populations under 500000 people and 27 of our sales and 31 of our inmarket locations were not in an msa in our view this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers operations have represented and continue to represent the foundation of our service approach 

we have two primary versions of our branch locations  

1 a traditional branch typically services a wide variety of customers including our larger national and regional accounts as well as retail customers locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction companies we stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and over time where appropriate our district and branch personnel may tailor the inventory offering to the needs of the local customer base since fastenals founding and through 2013 traditional branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company and we experienced net openings each year over that time span however new growth drivers business models onsites and business tools digital solutions have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth traditional branches were entirely usbased until 1994 when we opened our first location in canada at the end of 2021 we had 1649 traditional branches in the united states and canada and they represented 568 of total sales 

traditional branches are also differentiated by their operating styles certain locations are customer service branches csbs which tend to feature a showroom regular hours during which it is open to the public and our standard stocking model of products designed for contractors csbs are similar in function to a hardware store and they often conduct some business with nonaccount or retaillike customers however this customer set typically represents less than 10 of sales at this type of location other locations operate as customer fulfillment centers cfcs which tend to feature a limited showroom reduced hours of access to the public greater usage of willcall and stock customerspecific inventory these tend to appear and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location and tend not to have transactions with nonaccount or retaillike customers unless it is a will call arrangement related to an online transaction the choice of operating style is made by local leadership and is based on local market considerations at the end of 2021 35 of our traditional branches operated as a csb and 65 operated as a cfc 

2 an international branch is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada we first expanded outside of the united states and canada when we opened a branch in mexico in 2001 since then we have continued to expand our global footprint and at the end of 2021 we operated in 23 countries outside of the united states and canada mexico is the largest of these and we also operate in europe asia and central and south america our gotomarket strategy in countries outside of the united states and canada focuses primarily on servicing large national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing from a product perspective these customers are more heavily oriented toward planned fastener spend though nonfastener manufacturing repair and operations mro spend is becoming more common in these markets despite strong growth in our international business in recent years we are not as well recognized in many of our locations outside of the us and canada as we are in the us and canada however our ability to provide a consistent service model including vending bin stocks and onsites on a global basis is attractive to our customer base much of which are the foreign operations of north americanbased companies at the end of 2021 we had 144 international branches operating outside the us and canada and they represented 52 of total sales 

traditional and international branches sell to multiple customers we will continue to open traditional branches as the company sees fit however in each year since 2013 the company has experienced a net decline in its total branch count including net declines of 210 branches in 2021 our total decline since 2013 is 894 branches 

onsite locations may influence the trend in our traditional branch count over time but have not been the primary reason for our traditional branch closings the onsite concept is not new in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992 however it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014 we have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015 in this model we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within the customers facility or in some cases at a strategically placed offsite location with inventory that is specific to the customers needs in many cases we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch location though we are beginning to see more new customer opportunities arise as a result of our onsite capabilities the model is best suited to larger companies though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors it has been our experience that sales mix at our onsite locations produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations but we gain revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is lower we have identified over 15000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in the united states with potential to implement the onsite service model these include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today and potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence with which we do not have a meaningful relationship today however as awareness of our capabilities has grown we have identified additional onsite 

potential with certain agencies of state provincial and local government customers and academia we also believe as we follow our existing national account customers outside the united states our market potential for onsite solutions will continue to expand the international opportunity is substantial but our speed is limited by the relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the united states we expect revenues from onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time we had 1416 onsite locations as of december 31 2021 and they represented 316 of total sales and signed 274 223 and 362 new o nsite locations in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe the marketplace can support 375 to 400 new onsite signings annually we did not achieve that level of signings in 2021 2020 or 2019 as certain market variables including the ongoing covid19 pandemic supply chain constraints and labor shortages created challenges in our ability to engage with key decision makers and caused many of our customers to focus on shortterm crisis management rather than longterm strategic planning these conditions remain in force at the beginning of 2022 it is our intention to sign 375 to 400 new onsites in 2022 though achieving this may require some relief in the factors described above

5 the net impact of noninmarket locations or onsite locations converted to branches branches converted to onsite locations or noninmarket locations and closures of branches or onsite locations 

we believe the profitability of our inmarket locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site in any inmarket location certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable such as employeerelated expenses while others like rent and utility costs tend to be fixed as a result it has been shown that as an inmarket location increases its sales base over time it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin this ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by 1 general growth based on end market expansion andor market share gains 2 the age of the inmarket location new locations tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and in the case of a traditional branch the time necessary to generate a customer base andor 3 rationalization actions as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional 

branch base there are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market factories may have closed our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches andor our customers may have transitioned to our onsite model an onsite may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local traditional branch the paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an onsite location as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employeerelated expenses in the short term the onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged 

we utilize additional types of selling locations within our network but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number comprising less tha n five percent of our total selling locations we remain committed to a large robust service network including traditional branches it r emains the indispensable foundation of our business in any given year it is difficult to predict whether our total branch count will rise or fall how ever with the growth we anticipate in onsite locations we believe our total inmarket locations will increase over time 

our business tools 

fastenal managed inventory fmi ®  

over time we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location increase the visibility of a customers supply chain to the customer as well our personnel andor improve the ability to monitor or control usage while there are isolated exceptions these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and onsite channels to enhance service to our customers collectively these tools comprise our fastenal managed inventory fmi technology suite we believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers fmi programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and coupled with our fully integrated distribution network foster a strong relationship with customers 

bin stock faststock ℠ and fastbin ℠  programs where product is held in bins in a customer facility is similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities such programs have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time with open bins being clustered in a racking system each of which holds original equipment manufacturing oem fasteners mro fasteners andor nonfastener products that are consumed in the customers operations historically these bins were simply plastic and metal containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need these bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customer planograms which we call faststock and allow for the scanning of product when product is at a minimum desired level however in 2019 we introduced our fastbin technology fastbin is the evolution of faststock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 247 continuous inventory monitoring realtime inventory visibility and more efficient replenishment of bin stock parts these technologies come in three forms 1 scales utilize a highprecision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time automatically sending an order to fastenal when inventory hits an established minimum 2 infrared uses infrared sensors lining individual bins to provide realtime visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values automatically sending an order to fastenal when inventory hits an established minimum threshold 3 rfid is a kanban system that utilizes rfid tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone also part of the same racking system an automatic refill order is generated these technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities and immediate visibility to consumption changes allowing for a lean supply chain reducing risk of stockouts and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier 

industrial vending fastvend ℠  was introduced in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control benefits include reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and we believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive inmarket network of inventory and local personnel for these reasons the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and we finished 2021 with approximately 101600 fastvend nonweighted devices in the field which excludes approximately 12000 nonweighted vending devices that are part of a leased locker program with a specific retail customer we believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support we estimate the market could support as many as 17 million vending units and as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time 

our industrial vending portfolio consists of 24 different vending devices with 17 of these being in either a helix or locker format our most utilized models include the helixbased fast 5000 and our 12 and 18door lockers combined these comprise approximately 68 of our installed base of devices these are either configurable or are available in multiple 

configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers target monthly revenues per device typically range from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 with our flagship fast 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of 2000 

beginning in 2020 we began to report weighted fmi device signings and installations which is the combined activity of fastbin and fastvend converted into a comparable unit of measure or machine equivalent unit meu this conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each fmi device signed or installed and compares it to the 2000 target monthly throughput of our fast 5000 vending device for example an rfid enclosure with target monthly revenue of 2000 would be counted as 100 machine equivalent 20002000  100 an infrared bin with target monthly revenue of 40 would be counted as 002 machine equivalent 402000  002 

in 2022 we anticipate weighted fmi device signings to be in a range of 23000 to 25000 meus similar to onsite we believe the marketplace can support at least this level of signings annually though we did not achieve it in 2021 as variables including the ongoing covid19 pandemic supply chain constraints and labor shortages created challenges in our ability to engage with key decision makers and caused many of our customers to focus on shortterm crisis management rather than longterm strategic planning these conditions remain in force at the beginning of 2022 we acknowledge that achieving this may require some relief in the factors that negatively impacted our efforts in the preceding two years 

the table below summarizes the signings and installations of and sales through our fmi devices 



digital solutions 

we also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers leverage local inventory for sameday solutions and provide efficient service while there is a transactional element to our digital services many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain these solutions take many forms 

1 transactional our transactional or ecommerce platforms web verticals or integrated catalogs provides a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure mro and unplanned spend one of our ecommerce solutions fastenal express guides our customers to products which are locally stocked capitalizing on our existing location footprint in order to provide sameday or early nextday service for online orders this positions us to outperform what is most typically a 24 to 48hour fulfillment expectation while there is a retail component to our transactional digital services most of the revenue attributable to this is with our traditional customer base nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools that it utilizes with fastenal we attribute the revenue generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the inmarket location that traditionally services that customer location 

2 digital visibility certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves andor to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chains for instance we have developed and continue to develop mobility applications one example of which is our vending app which provides a number of benefits it provides easy realtime information pertaining to a customers local inventory position within their pointofuse devices it incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices improving customer inventories while reducing the risk of stockouts moving our fulfillment process from a vending devicebased keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process reduced risk of product outages reducing time consumed greater efficiency while improving accuracy improved quality assurance we will continue to build out our suite of mobility applications we also have eprocurement solutions electronic data interchange edi is the connectivity between our system and our customers procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their enterprise resource planning erp system or through a thirdparty procurement network or marketplace these solutions provide systemtosystem exchange of electronic 

procurement documents such as purchase orders advanced shipping notices and invoices for direct and indirect spend our eprocurement solutions provide a bridge between our fmi replenishment activity and our customers procurement systems – creating an efficient accurate and streamlined procuretopay p2p process fast 360° acts as the bridge between our fmi footprint and a customers view into our managed service model fast 360° surfaces data around these managed services as one central source of information as we manage our customers oem and mro product lines this is achieved through our fmi technologies providing locational data around our faststock fastbin and fastvend footprint and fast 360° being the means of surfacing that data and activities to our customers 

3 analytics we provide solutionbased digital platforms eg web verticals or integrated catalogs which leverages our existing strategic environment by creating a means of migrating online spend offline which illuminates our supply chain capabilities this is marketed under the fast 360° analytics label as it is an enterprisecentric extension of the digital visibility capabilities of fast 360° we bring value to our customers as well as ourselves by using these digital platforms and analytics to shift product from a nonsticky transactional environment which is online to a sticky strategic environment which is our fmi programs we create customer cost savings opportunities through this directive by lowering the total cost of ownership tco as the objective is to shrink the unplanned and traditionally high cost purely transactional spend bucket 

digital footprint 

we view our collective digital footprint as comprised of sales through fmi faststock fastbin and fastvend plus that proportion of our ecommerce sales that do not represent billings of fmi services we believe the data that is created through our digital capabilities enhances product visibility traceability and control that reduces risk in operations and creates ordering and fulfillment efficiencies for both ourselves and our customers as a result we believe our opportunity to grow our business will be enhanced through the continued development and expansion of our digital capabilities our digital footprint represented 427 of sales in 2021 the first year in which we explicitly measured it 

we believe our integrated physical and virtual model when paired with our national and increasingly international scope represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to ecommerce as an independent sales channel we expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time 

we believe our global channels to market and business tools including those that we consider to be growth drivers onsites international expansion fmi and digital solutions represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed this is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and sticky service combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling inmarket and otherwise and nonselling engineering product specialists manufacturing etc employees we offer a range of capabilities that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate 

distribution network 

we operate fifteen regional distribution centers in north america twelve are in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina kansas and mississippi – and three are outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico we also operate one distribution center in europe located in dordrecht netherlands these distribution centers give us approximately 49 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our inmarket locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier with approximately 81 of our north american inmarket locations receiving service four to five times per week the distribution centers in indiana and kansas also serve as master hubs with those in california and north carolina serving as secondary hubs to support the needs of the inmarket locations in their geographic regions as well as provide a broader selection of products for the inmarket locations serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california north carolina kansas and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems asrs these eleven distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 95 of our picking activity we expect to invest in additional automation technologies expand existing distribution facilities andor add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our inmarket locations increases 

in 2018 we began to deploy local inventory fulfillment terminals lifts these are small distribution facilities situated where we have a dense population of fmi devices traditionally responsibility for product fulfillment to vending devices and bin stocks have centered on individual branches which were responsible for stocking and packaging inventory delivering to a customers location and refilling the customers devices as our sales from fmi devices have grown this approach has resulted in redundant inventory in a territory and a greater proportion of our sales personnels time being spent on nonsales activities by centralizing inventory and packaging into a lift and relying on dedicated lift fulfillment personnel for delivery and device replenishment which we refer to as dropandscatter we can reduce fmidedicated inventory provide more consistent and predictable service to our customers fmi devices and free up time for our sales personnel to focus on customer penetration 

and acquisition our transportation network allows us to expand the geographic reach of our lifts by deploying a dropanddeliver model in this case a lift is responsible for stocking and packaging with the inventory and accuracy benefits that come with that focus but the delivery and replenishment continues to be performed by local branch personnel as the economics of a lift depend on device and sales density there will be geographic areas particularly in nonmsas where supporting an fmi platform will remain the responsibility of local branch personnel in 2021 less than 5 of our fmi revenue was serviced through a lift but over time we believe this figure can approximate 40 of our fmi revenue 

information systems 

our information systems teams develop implement secure and maintain the computerbased technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate digital distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of custom inhouse developed purchased and subscription licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including where industry meets innovation ™  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business we have registered or applied for the registration of various trademarks and service marks our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the united states as long as they are in use their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use 

products 

fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies this includes threaded fasteners bolts nuts screws studs and related washers as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as pins machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories our fastener product line which is primarily sold under the fastenal product name represented 333 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 

fastener distribution is complex in most cases the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight this presents challenges in moving product from suppliers most of whom are outside of north america to our distribution centers as well as from our distribution centers to our branch onsite and customer locations at the same time fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products construction projects and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application in many cases a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime andor effective use these features have greatly influenced our logistical development training and educational programs support capabilities and inventory decisions which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate 

in 1993 we began to aggressively add additional product lines and these represented 667 of our consolidated sales in 2021 these products which we refer to as nonfastener product lines tend to move through the same distribution channel get used by the same customers and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line this logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering however over time the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line for instance nonfastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending 

the most significant category of nonfastener products is our safety supplies product line which accounted for 212 of our consolidated sales in 2021 this product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years which we believe is directly attributable to our success in industrial vending over that period the covid19 pandemic uniquely impacted our safety supplies product line in 2020 we saw substantial growth based on our ability to quickly source and deliver supplies such as disposable masks gloves and gowns that were critical for governments health care providers and businesses to increase employee safety while maintaining operations in 2021 we experienced a decline as better industrial growth was more than offset by a decline in demand for pandemicrelated supplies that reflected the stabilization of the supply chain for critical products going forward we expect traditional variables such as market performance crossselling and vending adoption to be the primary drivers of performance for our safety supplies product line however we also believe the net effect of the pandemic has been to increase safety products as a percentage of product sales as safety protocols at many of our customers are likely to be sustained into the future 

in the last several decades we have added private label brands often referred to as exclusive brands or brands sold exclusively through fastenal to our nonfastener offering these private label brands represented approximately 13 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 we believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our nonfastener sales for two reasons 1 there is not a welldefined branded vs private label dynamic in fasteners as there is in non 

fasteners and 2 nonfastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business private label brands represented approximately 20 of our total nonfastener sales in 2021 our private label brand sales as a percentage of our total nonfastener sales declined in 2020 reflecting strong growth of covidrelated supplies which were not sold under a private label brand and recessionrelated weak safety demand from traditional manufacturing and construction customers many of which are marketed under a private label brand the performance of our private label brands in 2021 more closely resembled trends that preceded 2020 where we have typically experienced an increase in sales of private label products as a percentage of total nonfastener sales through specific sales channels such as onsite locations branches and vending often these increases through specific channels are masked by the relative sales growth we experience with onsite locations which typically have a lower percentage of total sales being private label than is the case in branches or sales through vending devices 

we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 2 of the n otes to co nsolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems by our sales personnel at inmarket locations by our district and regional leadership and by our product development team the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum stocking level all branches stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and branch personnel nonbranch selling locations primarily onsites stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

inventory held at our selling locations close to customers and available on a sameday basis accounted for approximately 57 of our total inventory at the end of 2021 inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 43 of our total inventory at the end of 2021 the distribution center and manufacturing location inventory when combined with our trucking network allows for fast nextday service at a very competitive cost 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2021 a pproximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 relate d to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  cardinal fasteners ®  and spensall ® product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to the repair of tools and hoists the fabrication of chain sling and hose band saw blade welding and other light manufacturing and fabrication we may add additional services in the future however we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect them to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales in the future 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2021 

in the case of fasteners and our private label nonfastener products we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area asia within asia suppliers in china represent a significant source of product further in many cases where we source directly from a north american supplier the original country of origin of the acquired parts is the suppliers asian facilities as a result the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions 

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers and historically has represented approximately 65 of our business the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors and historically has represented approximately 1015 of our business other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades 

based on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing and nonresidential construction our business has historically been cyclical however we believe our model has certain features that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes first we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing and nonresidential construction market while slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries locally or globally we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions second while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities this latter source of revenue tends to be directly influenced by cyclical changes but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic 

in 1995 we developed a national accounts program aimed at making our products and services more competitive with customers that operate multiple facilities these customers tend to have more complex supply chains and structures for managing the oem and mro products we provide while at the same time by virtue of their size and opportunity have more negotiating power we believe our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint our ability to provide a consistent level of hightouch service and broad product availability and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing quality control and product knowledge are attractive to these larger customers we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels such as onsite fmi digital solutions and resources to serve these customers unique demands as a result in 2021 national accounts represented 566 of our sales compared to 550 and 536 in 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percent of our total sales over time 

in an inmarket location our customers business activity is tracked through active accounts customers often have more than one active account at a single inmarket location reflecting their utilization of different fastenal services and frequently have active accounts at many inmarket locations across our global network during 2021 our total number of active customer accounts defined as the average number of accounts per month with purchase activity of at least 100 was approximately 132000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts per month with purchase activity of at least 500 was approximately 77000 during 2021 no single customer represented 5 or more of our consolidated net sales 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local inmarket selling personnel as well as our nonbranch selling personnel we support our sales team with multichannel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing print and radio advertising targeted campaigns promotional flyers and events in recent years our national advertising has been focused on a nascar ® sponsorship through our partnership with roush fenway keselowski racing ® as the primary sponsor of the no 17 car in the nascar ® cup series driven by chris buescher in 2020 our sports marketing efforts were extended when the national hockey league nhl ®  awarded us as the preferred mro supplier of the sport 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales the first and fourth quarters are typically our lowest volume periods given their overlap with winter months in north america during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather the fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the thanksgiving october in canada and november in the united states christmas and new year holiday periods due to plant shut downs in contrast the second and third quarters typically have higher revenues due to stronger nonresidential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays although good friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of july will always fall in the third quarter 

competition 

our business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas and smaller regional or local distributors which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products in no particular order are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

market strategies in industrial distribution are varied with respect to products many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broadline offering over time however they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share this association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors though many smaller competitors do deploy a broadline model means of serving the customer are even more diverse for instance many competitors maintain a local branchbased presence in their markets while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales recent years have seen the emergence of ecommerce solutions such as websites and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors it also has introduced nontraditional webbased competitors into the marketplace the diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base the large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels from a single distributor or from a range of distributors to procure the products they need in their operations 

we believe that better service and a competitive selling advantage can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers locations as a result we maintain branches in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products the convenience of a large number of branches in a given area combined with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our fmi solutions supported by an inmarket location provides a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each inmarket location also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local branch the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure 

human capital resources 

employees 

at the end of 2021 we employed 20507 full and parttime employees of these approximately 71 held an inmarket or nonbranch selling role we characterize these personnel as follows 



1 our noninmarket selling employee count has grown in recent years due to an increased focus on resources to support our growth drivers particularly onsite and national account growth 

2 administrative primarily includes our sales support information technology finance and accounting human resources and senior leadership roles and functions our administrative employee count has also grown in recent years due to increased personnel investments in information technology and operational support such as purchasing and product development 

employee profile 

as of december 31 2021 we had 20507 employees worldwide with 16548 of those employees located within the united states us 2568 employees located in canada and mexico and 1391 employees located overseas in 22 other countries throughout the world 

based on our eeo1 data for 2020 which is the most recent period for which data is available and our most recently filed information in the united states females and minorities constitute 244 and 205 of our workforce respectively based on us bureau of labor statistics data we believe fastenals mix of female and minority employees is generally consistent with the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates the proportion of females and minorities in our workforce declined slightly in 2020 it is difficult to know what the impact was from the severe social disruption in the period caused by covid19 

generally though we believe this data is best viewed over time rather than yeartoyear on this basis there is a clear trend toward greater diversity in our business in the eight years since 2012 our female and minority workforces have grown 27x and 38x faster respectively than our overall us workforce this trend reflects multiple dynamics in our business evolution including the natural progression of our geographic expansion the cycle of our promotefromwithin philosophy and efforts to improve hiring processes over time 

health and safety 

employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business weve taken a multifaceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business trainings audits inspections risk assessments safety coaching and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility and employee safety our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance we continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows 

this commitment to and continuous improvement towards a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results a widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the experience modification rate emr an organizations emr is established through the comparison of a companys past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages which are compiled by the national council on compensation insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization industry averages are benchmarked at a 100 emr with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organizations ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk in 2021 the most recent year for which this figure has been calculated fastenal had an emr of 045 which is 55 better than the average performance rate for our industry 

in 2021 ehs today  a health and safety trade organization recognized fastenal as one of americas safest companies an award received by just over 250 companies since 2002 according to ehs this honor reflects support from leadership for health and safety efforts employee involvement in health and safety processes innovative solutions to safety challenges comprehensive training programs evidence that incident prevention is the cornerstone of the safety process good communication about the value of safety a way to substantiate the benefits of the safety process and injury and illness rates below the industry average this recognition reflects the priority that members of our organization place on health and safety 

employment and compensation philosophy 

fastenals success is defined by our people our cultural values – ambition  integrity  innovation and teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols and inform our employment and compensation philosophies 

several principles underpin our employment philosophy one is decentralization placing employees close to our customers operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service a second is that we are a passionately promotefromwithin company guided by a belief that if you work hard make great decisions learn from mistakes and exemplify our cultural values you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility we believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment 

as it relates to our compensation philosophy we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort we are guided by simple principles 1 programs should be easy to understand with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided they should be calculable by the employee and numbersdriven eg not subjective 2 total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers 3 employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal 

approximately 71 of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customerfacing employees typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts paid monthly based on growth in sales gross or pretax profit achieved and prudent management of working capital in certain roles there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals most focused on either customer service or better execution of companywide activities 

because we believe the growth in the companys stock value should be the reward for achieving longterm success consistent with being an owner we have a stock option plan in the case of certain foreign employees we have a stock appreciation rights plan all of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights 

we believe our combination of short and longterm rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and acceptable levels of employee retention and turnover 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good 

talent acquisition and development 

fastenals values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership the ultimate goal is straightforward find great people ask them to join and give them a reason to stay reasons to stay include training opportunity and a welcoming environment from a practical standpoint this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities in accordance with our decentralized leadership structure we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening in light of our promotefromwithin philosophy we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire 

our human resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage we have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions supplemented with training through the fastenal school of business we have a diversity and compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework which ensures its integrity not only is this process followed for all new hires we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program known as fsb develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific training and development programs that are offered to our employees the programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructorled training virtual instructorled training and online learning fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective branch best practices sales and marketing products supply chain and distribution 

product sourcing endeavors 

sourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain we expect our suppliers to comply with all regulations and standards and we conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us to obtain additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics quality and reliability so we can be certain they meet our standards in these areas and to ensure that they are complying with fastenals supplier terms  code of conduct and global supplier purchase order terms  conditions as we are subject to the conflict minerals rules with the help of thirdparty resources and global databases scanning over 100 lists of agencies known risk adverse media and financial status fastenal monitors key areas of traderelated risk including dualuse goods and utilization of sanctioned countries or entities as these are common ways that international trade might provide capital and restricted goods to sanctioned parties launder funds of drug traffickers and otherwise support criminals we also evaluate our suppliers approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate and appropriately compensated employees 

with a local and global supplier base continuous monitoring and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are triggered when risk may be evident ensuring a safeguard against poor andor impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation in the marketplace this is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding but for the life of the relationship with the supplier this process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of fastenals supplier terms  code of conduct and global supplier purchase order terms  conditions in the event of noncompliance or potential risk we work with the supplier to correct the situation if remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with fastenals standards and code of conduct alternative sources for supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance ensuring that no matter where a customers operations may take them fastenal has the infrastructure resources and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations 

in 2021 approximately 33 of our total companywide inventory spend was with small andor diverse businesses this flows from our supplier diversity program as part of which we are committed to building supply chain relationships with small businesses and businesses with diverse ownership including women minorities veterans and lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt owned certified lgbt business enterprise ® suppliers

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company specific risks 

operational risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including inside and outside branch associates onsite managers national account sales representatives and support personnel who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high particularly for less tenured employees if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels 

cyber security incidents or violations of data privacy laws and regulations could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent such unauthorized access and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event including any cyber security event the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of cyber sec urity incidents cannot be eliminated entirely there can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our consolidated financial statements while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace in addition regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new privacy security laws and regulations including the european union general data protection regulation 2016 the california consumer protection act and other similar state privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges which may increase compliance costs and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner could disrupt operations cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues and result in less efficient operations the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities still information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access 

telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us it is also possible that we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our information systems our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data as well as the success of our growth drivers is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable or if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations it could adversely affect our profitability andor ability to grow 

the ability to adequately protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations our business relies on the use validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property which includes current and future patents trade secrets trademarks service marks copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect our rights in addition we may be subject to claims that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others which could subject us to liability require us to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause us to modify our operations 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future changes in our customer or product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing for approximately twentyfive years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products similarly in recent years revenues from national accounts andor onsite customers which typically have lower gross profit margins by virtue of their scale available business and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross margins have tended to grow faster than revenues from smaller customers however whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are or are not offset by positive impacts to gross profit margin during such year for instance in 2020 our gross profit margin declined significantly as the pandemic generated significant sales of certain products such as ppe and sanitizer that have traditionally lower gross profit margins conversely as business conditions normalized in 2021 sales of these products declined versus the prior year which more than offset our traditional mixrelated margin pressure and resulted in improvement of our gross profit margin setting aside these or other unusual circumstances however customer and product mix have contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage over time and will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentag e into the foreseeable future other variables that could cause our gross margin to decline include d ownward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume or timing of our orders andor an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances we may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace 

our operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings over time we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses including costs related to payroll occupancy freight and information technology among others as our net sales have grown however historically a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins there are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past for instance it is typical that when demand declines most commonly from cyclical or general market factors though it could be due to customer losses or some other companyspecific event our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales it is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales in addition market variables such as labor rates energy costs and legal costs could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable us to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings should any of these scenarios or a combination of them occur in the future it is possible that our operating and pretax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue 

failure to implement an effective environmental social and governance esg strategy could result in financial losses or a tarnished corporate reputation customers suppliers employees community partners shareholders and regulatory agencies are increasingly requesting disclosure and action relating to esg performance and objectives for instance over the last five years we have included shareholder proposals in our proxy statement seeking specific actions around social and governance policy and reporting we have also seen an increase in customer requests for information pertaining to diversity and environmental policy including that our scores with various thirdparty esg rating organizations achieve a certain threshold 

an inability to satisfactorily address the concerns of our stakeholders could adversely affect our corporate reputation image identity brand equity and status which in turn could hurt our ability to retain and acquire customers and employees or negatively impact the price performance of our common stock increasing reporting and operational regulations around esg matters may result in higher operating expenses andor capital expenditures that could reduce our profitability andor cash flow 

failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over business processes andor financial reporting could materially impact our business and results company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations reporting and compliance any internal control system no matter how well designed and operated can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems internal control over business processes and financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over business processes and financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to litigation economic loss or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within north america and abroad in recent years we have increased the resources devoted to our growth drivers including fmi onsites national accounts digital solutions and our interna tional operations while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth failure to achieve any of our goals regarding fmi onsites national accounts digital solutions and international operations or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth in fact the covid19 pandemic has made gaining access to customers more challenging due to both alternative work arrangements to manage risk of infection in workplaces and due to shifts in priorities to shortterm crisis management and away from longterm strategic planning this has resulted in our signings of onsites and fmi installations both important indicators of future sales growth to be below target levels in 2020 and 2021 further failure to identify appropriate targets for our onsite channel and fmi tools or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our goals regarding the number of new onsite locations we are able to open or the number of fmi installations we are able to deploy 

our competitive advantage in fmi solutions which includes industrial vending fastvend and bin stock faststock and fastbin tools could be eliminated and in the case of fastvend the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software our local branch presence allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly and with less burden on our customers our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending devices used in our fastvend platform while these devices software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in us failing to meet our goals related to the number of devices we are able to deploy in the next twelve to eighteen months in addition as we experienced in 2020 and 2021 our ability to deploy our fmi solutions at targeted levels could be limited by events similar to the covid19 pandemic if customers shift their energy to addressing shortterm disruptions instead of longterm strategic planning 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete our ability to generate additional sales and our profit margins our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the selling location level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

we may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or nontraditional competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although slowly consolidating still remains a large fragmented and highly competitive industry our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing technological and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources technological advancements and services increased competition from brickandmortar retailers could cause us to lose market share reduce our prices or increase our spending similarly the emergence of online retailers whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major nontraditional competitors could result in easier 

and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods these pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage over time 

our inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership in the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight andor leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles in addition difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team or recruiting suitable replacements could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

equity risks 

there can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time stock prices including ours are commonly thought to be a function of earnings compounded by a multiple this is often referred to as a pricetoearnings or pe ratio historically investors have given our earnings a higher multiple or premium than is typical of the broader industrial sector of which we are typically associated we believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth profitability and returns however to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies andor poorly navigate the risks that surround our business including those described throughout this section or to the extent our industry industrial distribution or industrial stocks in general loses favor in the marketplace there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2020 2018 and prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors 

general economic and operating risks 

operational risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

• general business conditions 

• business conditions in our principal markets 

• interest rates 

• inflation 

• liquidity in credit markets 

• taxation 

• government regulations and actions 

• energy and fuel prices and electrical power rates 

• unemployment trends 

• terrorist attacks and acts of war 

• impact of higher sustained global temperatures global warming 

• acts of god which may include but are not limited to weather events earthquakes pandemics etc and 

• other matters that influence customer confidence and spending 

a downturn in either the national or local economy where we operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our inmarket locations sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those inmarket locations and other selling channels 

this risk was demonstrated in 2021 as economic confidence and general business conditions recovered from the covidrelated downturn in 2020 spending for industrial supplies to companies engaged in construction and the manufacture of components capital goods and heavy equipment expanded sharply this produced a resumption of growth in key cyclical product lines such as fasteners that had declined the preceding year only partly offset by reduced sales of covid related supplies to government healthcare and warehousing customers at the same time we believe our growth was restrained by other economic factors these include 1 difficulty adding labor resources potentially due to low unemployment concerns about the pandemic and government stimulus support 2 supply chain disruption due to constraints for certain raw material and component availability production capacity shipping capacity and labor availability and 3 the impact of inflation for raw materials manufactured components transportation services and labor these trends were evident throughout 2021 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available which could adversely affect our inventory levels and opera ting results we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations disruption in trade relationships and agreements political unrest war disease or changes in local economic conditions additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial capacity or other difficulties we experienced this in 2021 as a lack of shipping and labor capacity caused primarily by the strong recovery in global product demand but exacerbated by continued pandemicrelated workforce disruption constrained our ability to efficiently import supplies and increased shipping costs significantly our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing products and services of comparable quality and utility 

trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly and could adversely impact our gross andor operating profit percentage we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of north america primarily asia we have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from asia through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources this was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production but over time we have expanded our nonfastener sourcing as well and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term in light of this changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers andor impact the cost or price of our products with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results china represents a significant source of product for north america in addition we move and source products within north america any trading disruption tariffs product restrictions etc between canada the united states and mexico or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business the degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies their timing and duration and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel plastic and energy costs can fluctuate significantly over time increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and branch operations have fluctuated as well this was a meaningful issue in 2021 when costs for metals particularly steel fuels and overseas shipping services increased sharply to reflect strong demand and labor constraints while we typically try to pass higher supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact including in 2021 we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit to decline or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that north american market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed 140 billion this figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreedupon demand and market share statistics instead we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources if we have 

overestimated the size of our market and in doing so underestimated our current share of it the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe similarly we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies such as fmi solutions and onsite locations within north america we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approxi mately 17 million devices and we have identified over 15000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base we have identified additional markets such as government healthcare and academia and geographies into which we can sell our fmi solutions which would increase the number of identified potential fmi solutions or customer locations however our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies which could extend the sales cycle similar to the case for total market size we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity 

the ongoing occurrence of the covid19 pandemic or any other such widespread public health crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the onset of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 impacted our business due to government authorities and customers imposing facility closures workfromhome orders social distancing protocols andor other restrictions these actions had both positive strong sales of safety and sanitation supplies to government healthcare and warehousing customers and negative weak sales to industrial and construction customers as well as disruption in signings of onsites and fmi devices effects in 2021 though the pandemic continued to impact united states and world populations in the form of high infection and hospitalization rates including from new variants of covid19 this effect on our business and financial condition was secondary to the reopening and recovery of the global economy even so the continued public health concerns resulting from the covid19 pandemic continue to create significant uncertainty economic disruption and volatility all of which have impacted and may continue to impact our business we may be required to take significant actions to mitigate future outbreaks including but not limited to facility closures and workfromhome policies andor customer activity may be affected by their own mitigation actions this could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition however as we cannot predict the severity and duration of the pandemic including additional outbreaks new variants of the virus and the future availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines the net financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales given that we were founded and remain based in the united states and that we are publiclytraded in the united states we report our results based on the united states dollar because the functional currency related to most of our nonunited states operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar there can be no 

assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure if we decide to do so in the future we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy including in the us the california consumer privacy act and in the european union the general data protection regulation 2016 with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country and cyber security requirements including protection of information and incident responses regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results we are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties further our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected positively or negatively by changing tax priorities changes in statutory rates andor changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof the most significant recent example of this is the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which was enacted in the united states in december 2017 however in september 2021 the ways and means committee of the united states house of representatives published tax proposals that if ultimately enacted as proposed could result in higher tax payments as a result of higher corporate tax rates and higher taxes on earnings from foreign jurisdictions 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgements by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as asset impairment inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters business combinations and legal matters are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process internal control and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

credit and liquidity risks 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results as of december 31 2021 we had 3900 of outstanding debt obligations of which 3650 is senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement while 250 is loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on november 30 2023  the notes issued under our master note agreement consist o f seven ser ies and are described in further detail in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain this was a factor most recently in 2020 the turmoil that came with the onset of the covid19 pandemic did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time however the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased we currently have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return the cost of servicing any existing balances on our credit facility at that time could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility on march 5 2021 the uk financial conduct authority announced that 

immediately after december 31 2021 publication of certain libor settings would permanently cease with most other libor settings including 1 month 3 month and 6 month libor settings ceasing on june 30 2023 our credit facility currently uses libor as a reference rate and while there are customary libor replacement provisions in our credit facility the transition to alternatives to libor could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of over 3200 inmarket locations most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes sales of products for both original equipment manufacturing oem where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers and manufacturing repair and operations mro where are products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our branches onsite locations and customers are primarily located in north america 

it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big we estimate the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america and no company has a significant portion of this market 2 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive but the cost and time to manage procure and transport these products can be quite meaningful 3 purchasing professionals often expend disproportionate effort managing the high stock keeping unit sku count of lowvolume low value mro supplies which is better allocated to their higher volume higher value oem supplies 4 many customers prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business while also utilizing various technologies and models including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly to improve availability and reduce waste 5 we believe the markets are efficient in our view this means that companies that grow market share are those that develop differentiated capabilities that provide the greatest value to the customer 

our approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto where industry meets innovation ™  the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support customers and empower them to operate in a decentralized fashion to maximize their flexibility to solve customer problems we support these customerfacing resources with a supply chain capability that is speedy efficient and costeffective this has formed the foundation of our hightouch model since inception second we invest in develop and deploy capabilities that allow us to illuminate and provide greater control over a customers supply chain these capabilities range from service models that take advantage of our local presence andor our ability to more efficiently manage complex procurement needs to hardware and software technologies that promote actionable data capture improve operating efficiencies and reduce supply chain risk third we strive to generate strong profits which produce the cash flow necessary to support our growth our product and technology development and the needs of our customers 

the ultimate aim of this hightech hightouch approach to gaining market share is to allow us to get closer to our customers going so far as to be right to the point of consumption within customers facilities marrying our presence capabilities and technologies deepens our relationships and our understanding of our customers daytoday opportunities and obstacles this in turn enhances our ability to provide innovative and comprehensive solutions to our customers challenges by doing these things every day fastenal remains a growthcentric organization 

impact of covid19 on our business 

in the second quarter of 2020 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business were dramatic in two respects first local and national actions taken such as stayathome mandates reduced business activity sharply as many customers either closed their locations or operated at significantly diminished capacity this effect was illustrated in a significant decline in sales for our fastener products second social actions taken to mitigate the effects of the pandemic produced significant demand for personal protection equipment ppe and sanitation products generating significant sales of such products not only to certain traditional customers but also to state and local government entities as well as front line responders this effect was illustrated by a significant increase in sales for our safety products during that period improved sales of ppe and sanitation products 

more than offset the general economic weakness these dynamics affected our business throughout the second quarter of 2020 but the effects were greatest in april with sequential improvements in may and june as business restrictions gradually eased 

the pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our business in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 the marketplace broadly and fastenal specifically continued to operate with certain modifications to balance reopening with employee and customer safety however most of the markets in which we operate began to normalize in the second half of 2020 this improved the outlook of the manufacturing and construction customers that support our traditional branch and onsite business and moderated the level of demand for ppe and sanitation products that we experienced at the onset of the pandemic the sequential gains in economic activity that we experienced in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 continued through the third and fourth quarters of 2020 

in 2021 we saw several distinct business patterns which mostly persisted throughout the period first economic normalization continued resulting in strong demand from our traditional manufacturing and nonresidential construction customers second the pandemic continued with ebbs and flows in infections during the year this resulted in businesses including fastenal continuing to take steps to promote workforce and customer health and safety however in contrast to the early part of 2020 the pandemic was not primarily responsible for plant shutdowns or production cuts companies navigated the pandemic mostly without curtailing operations third this combination of strong demand coupled with ongoing adaptations to the pandemic resulted in a number of stresses accompanying economic growth supply chain disruption labor force constraints and product and shipping inflation as a result while the economic backdrop was solid throughout 2021 satisfying customer demand was challenged by difficulty in procuring materials retaining sufficient part and fulltime labor to service existing customers and acquire new ones and offsetting inflation we exited 2021 with each of those dynamics still largely intact 

at the height of the pandemic and consistent with broader social trends we took steps to safeguard the health of our employees and customers this included closing facilities to outside personnel adjusting work schedules spaces and technologies to allow for social distancing providing ample ppe and cleaning supplies and having formal mitigation policies in the event of infection these precautions allowed our operations to continue to function effectively at the end of 2021 our operations were operating mostly normally although we continue to practice social distancing within our facilities make ppe and cleaning supplies available and follow our mitigation policies when an infection is identified the pandemic has not precipitated any issues with our internal controls financial health or liquidity with substantially all of our 7000 bank revolver available for use 

there remains significant uncertainty concerning the duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as the severity of any future infection surges as a result future events deriving from covid19 may negatively impact sales and gross margin due to among other things limitations on the ability of our suppliers to manufacture or procure from manufacturers the products we sell an inability to meet delivery requirements and commitments limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local state or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers and shareholders while we are unable to determine or predict the nature duration or scope of the overall impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our business results of operations liquidity or capital resources we believe that it is important to share where our company stands today how our response to covid19 is progressing and how our operations and financial condition may change as the fight against covid19 progresses 

executive overview 

net s ales increased 3634 or 64 in 2021 relative to 2020 our gross profit increased 2095 or 82 in 2021 relative to 2020 and as a percentage of net sales increased to 462 in 2021 from 455 in 2020 our operating income increased 756 or 66 in 2021 relative to 2020 and as a percentage of net sales increased to 203 in 2021 from 202 in 2020 

our net earnings in 2021 were 9250 an increase of 77 when compared to 2020 our diluted net earnings per share were 160 in 2021 compared to 149 in 2020 an increase of 74 

the year 2021 was marked by a number of trends favorably we experienced strong demand from our traditional manufacturing and nonresidential construction customers unfavorably we experienced disruption in supply chains and labor markets exacerbated by periodic surges in covid19 infections as well as significant inflation in product and transportation costs while these variables do present challenges with respect to having sufficient product availability and cost of service at this point the impact of covid19 is primarily indirect through its influence on cyclical factors the primary exception is in our ability to market our growth drivers as many of our customers were focused on shortterm crisis management over longterm strategic planning as a result the environment was not conducive to achieving the level of signings we would have 

expected under normal business conditions these dynamics produced signings of 274 new onsite customer locations and 19311 weighted fastbinfastvend signings in 2021 

the table below summarizes our absolute and fulltime equivalent fte based on 40 hours per week employee headcount our investments in inmarket locations defined as the sum of the total number of branch locations and the total number of active onsite locations and weighted fmi at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period 



1 this number excludes approximately 12000 nonweighted devices that are part of our locker lease program 

during the last twelve months we increased o ur total fte employee headc ount by 534 this reflects an increase in our inmarket and noninmarket selling fte employee headcount of 230 to support growth in the marketplace and sales initiatives targeting customer acquisition we had an increase in our distribution center fte employee headcount of 149 to support increasing product throughput at our facilities and to expand our local inventory fulfillment terminals lifts we had an increase in our remaining fte employee headcount of 155 that relates primarily to personnel investments in information technology and operational support such as purchasing and product development 

we opened two branches in the fourth quarter of 2021 and closed 68 branches net of conversions we activated 65 onsite locations in the fourth quarter of 2021 and closed 16 net of conversions in 2021 we opened ten branches and closed 220 net of conversions in 2021 we activated 242 onsite locations and closed 91 net of conversions in any period the number of closings tend to reflect both normal churn in our business whether due to redefinin g or exiting customer relationships the shutting or relocation of customer facilities that host our locations or a customer decision as well as our ongoing review of underperforming locations our inmarket n etwork forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open or close locations as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network support our growth drivers and manage our operating expenses 

results of operations 

the following sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information as a percentage of net sales for the periods ended december 31 



net sales 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period the table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended december 31 and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period 



the increase in net sales noted above for 2021 was due to higher unit sales of industrial products to traditional manufacturing and construction customers and higher pricing only partly offset by lower pandemicrelated ppe sales as the prior years demand surge did not recur 

higher unit sales in 2021 were a result of strong economic activity which increased demand for our products to our traditional manufacturing and construction customers although economic strength was fairly consistent throughout the year our growth patterns were not primarily due to comparisons related to the timing of pandemicrelated ppe sales in the previous year for instance our daily sales growth in the first half of 2021 was 25 our cyclical product categories substantially outperformed this as exemplified by fastener daily sales growth of 154 in the first half of 2021 however this was mostly offset by the absence of significant spending for ppe that occurred in the previous period which is best illustrated by safety products daily sales decline of 202 in first half of 2021 by contrast our daily sales growth in the second half of 2021 was a much stronger 123 our cyclical product categories continued to outperform with fastener daily sales having grown 222 in the second half of 2021 while certain products and markets within our business continued to face difficult ppe comparisons they were not as severe as what had been experienced in the first half of 2021 which allowed our safety products to post daily growth of 03 in the second half of 2021 

our growth drivers also returned to contributing meaningfully to higher unit sales in 2021 due to strong business activity within our customer base and to a lesser degree a higher installed base of fmi devices our number of active onsites increased 119 for instance while onsite daily sales growth was 206 similarly our installed base of fmi meus increased 106 while fmi daily sales growth was 410 

while demand was strong throughout 2021 the year experienced certain disruptions the first were supply chain constraints as the rapid recovery in demand resulted in shortages in production and shipping capacity the second was labor shortages which were particularly acute in the market for parttime employees the third was the ongoing covid19 pandemic which continued to produce periodic surges in infection rates while businesses largely managed through these events as opposed to stopping production the instability it created in worker availability exacerbated the preexisting supply chain and labor challenges the fourth was inflation in material costs overseas and domestic transportation expenses and labor wage rates we believe the most significant impact of these disruptions was on our growth driver signings we signed 274 onsites in 2021 above the prior year 223 signings but well below our goal at the start of 2021 of 375 to 400 units similarly we signed 19311 fmi meus above the prior year 16503 meus but well below our goal at the start of the year of 23000 to 25000 meus we believe many of our customers were diverting significant energy to managing the effects of supply chain labor covid19 and inflation in the short term and it lengthened the sales cycle for our supply chain solutions 

price contributed 200 to 230 basis points to our net sales growth in 2021 we instituted a number of pricing events during 2021 as a means of mitigating rising product and transportation costs as these events fell more heavily into the second half of the year price contributed an increasing amount through the period with price in the fourth quarter of 2021 contributing 440 to 470 basis points to net sales growth 

higher unit sales in 2020 were heavily influenced by actions taken by governments and businesses around the world to address covid19 which influenced the period in a couple of ways first by virtue of our ability to source and transport ppe we were able to supply the needs of governments first responders and businesses as they worked to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our communities and normalize business activity under more stringent safety protocols this generated significant ppe sales through the year we believe the best proxies for this trend was daily sales growth of our safety products of 510 and daily sales growth to our government and healthcare customers of 1297 second we managed the effects of business closures disruption in labor forces and supply chains and a reduction in general business activity that was a byproduct of the responses of governments and businesses to the pandemic the impact of this is best illustrated by several metrics for 

instance united states industrial production which is published by the federal reserve decreased 71 in 2020 based on the large proportion of our sales that are derived from the united states we believe united states industrial production is a good proxy for the state of our marketplace and that the significant decline in this metric is consistent with the weakness we experienced in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets this was also reflected in the daily sales of fasteners which is our most cyclical product line daily sales of fasteners declined 72 in 2020 although traditional manufacturing and construction business activity has gradually but steadily improved from depressed second quarter of 2020 levels it did remain negative through the year taking these two variables together higher unit sales of ppe more than offset the decline in unit sales in our traditional manufacturing and construction business resulting in higher net unit sales in 2020 

our growth drivers did not contribute meaningfully to higher unit sales in 2020 which we believe is largely a function of difficulties gaining access to customers and facilities due to social distancing and safety guidelines in response to covid19 we signed 16417 industrial vending devices during 2020 a decrease of 249 from 2019 this did increase our installed base to 95733 devices at the end of 2020 an increase of 64 over 2019 but this increase was not sufficient to offset reduced throughput per device as a result sales through our vending devices declined at a low singledigit rate during 2020 we activated 257 new onsite locations in 2020 a decrease of 176 over 2019 this allowed us to increase our active sites to 1265 at the end of 2020 an increase of 136 over 2019 but this increase was not sufficient to offset significant sales declines in our older more established onsite locations as a result sales through our onsite locations declined at a low singledigit rate during 2020 we did experience growth in our national account customers of 67 in 2020 compared to 2019 though this was due to the sale of ppe to customers navigating the challenges of operating during a pandemic 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from fasteners safety supplies and all other product lines was as follows 



the shifts in product mix over the last two years reflect the impact of the pandemic in 2020 actions taken by governments and businesses to address covid19 caused a significant decline in economic activity that produced sales declines in our cyclical products such as fasteners but increased demand for ppe and produced sales growth in our safety products the effect was to reduce our mix of sales coming from fasteners and other product lines while increasing the mix of sales coming from safety products in 2021 these dynamics reversed with economic recovery generating strong growth in our cyclical product lines while the absence of surge sales and stabilization in the supply chain for ppe restrained growth in safety products the effect was to increase our mix of sales coming from fasteners and other product lines while reducing the mix of sales coming from safety products 

our product categories did not fully revert to prepandemic levels in 2021 as our mix of safety products in 2021 of 212 remained meaningfully above our mix of safety products in 2019 of 179 in the short term the pandemic has created heightened safety and sanitation protocols relative to the prepandemic period and the increased use of related products as a result has increased our mix of safety products sales 

shifts in product mix in 2020 largely reflects the factors that impacted our sales growth in the period specifically strong demand for ppe generated strong sales growth in our safety products while weak trends in underlying conditions affected our traditional manufacturing and construction customers resulting in a sales decline in our fastener products the effect on other products was relatively muted as certain lines benefited from pandemicrelated demand such as janitorial products while others were negatively impacted by underlying demand such as metal cutting and material handling 

annual sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

annual sales changes by month 

during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth contraction rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 



sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days andor seasons impact certain end markets particularly nonresidential construction the first landing centers on easter and the good friday holiday that precedes it which in any given year can fall in march or april the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our nonresidential construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average 20152019 we have excluded 2020 from the average as the effects of the pandemic created unusual sequential patterns that we do not consider representative of normal trends we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2021 2020 and 2019 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 21delta 20delta and 19delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year under normal circumstances the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets further in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark however we do not believe that fully explains the exaggerated delta between the sequential rates of change and the benchmark from march 2020 to july 2020 we believe deviation of this duration and order of magnitude is uncharacteristic in our business and is related to the dramatic impacts of the pandemic in that period 

it is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages in a year where demand is strong our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it in a year where demand is weak we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it in both cases there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform 



1 the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

2 the benchmark for each month is the average of the previous five years for that month excluding the impact of the march 2017 mansco acquisition surge sales associated with covid19 make sequential averages in 2020 unrepresentative as a result the 2021 benchmark uses a preceding fiveyear average that excludes 2020 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

we estimate approximately 65 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market the daily sales growth contraction rates to these manufacturing customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line which under normal business conditions represents 30 to 35 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth contraction rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



two product lines safety and janitorial accounted for approximately 44 of total nonfastener sales in 2021 as previously disclosed covid19 generated outsized growth in these two product categories in 2020 and the subsequent stabilization of the supply chain resulted in a reduction in orders and sales performance in 2021 that was well below what might normally be expected given the health of the industrial economy as a result the change in our nonfastener lines in 2021 and 2020 did not provide as much insight into the trends of our traditional manufacturing and construction customers as is typically the case still we have sold nonfastener products through multiple cycles that do not include a pandemic and believe we can make several observations generally speaking our nonfastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles however we would typically expect it to outperform our fastener business in any cycle this reflects three things the nonfastener market is larger than the fastener market we are underpenetrated in the nonfastener market relative to the fastener market and industrial vending lends itself to sales of nonfastener products this dynamic is visible in 2019 results 

our nonresidential construction and reseller customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business though in 2021 it was slightly below the bottom of this range as our industrial customers led our sales recovery the daily sales growth contraction rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



our nonresidential construction and reseller business is heavily influenced by manufacturing oil and gas and infrastructure spending in 2021 improving economic business conditions high prices for commodities such as metals and energy and tightening facilities utilization produced improving growth rates throughout the year in 2020 and 2019 the poor and slowing production environment respectively and as described above and the accompanying worsening trends for commodities such as metals and energy caused the growth in our nonresidential construction and reseller customers to slow in 2020 this was exacerbated by project suspensions as many states and regions shut down activity in an effort to control the pandemic 

gross profit 

the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 462 in 2021 and 455 in 2020 the gross profit percentage for 2021 increased by 70 basis points based on higher product margins primarily for safety products and overheadorganizational leverage related to higher volumes 

during 2021 our gross profit percentage increased when compared to the prior year this was largely due to three factors 1 we were able to leverage overheadorganizational expenses absorbing certain fixed and period costs related to cyclical strength in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets 2 an improvement in product margins particularly for safety products in response to the pandemic in 2020 we experienced a substantial surge in demand for covidrelated safety supplies such that these products accounted for approximately 47 of total safety product sales in 2020 up from approximately 25 of total safety product sales in 2019 as these products tended to carry a lower gross margin than noncovidrelated products their substantial expansion in our safety product mix in 2020 caused a decline in the gross profit percentage of our safety product line in 2021 we experienced higher demand for noncovidrelated products as the industrial economy improved and lower demand for covidrelated products as the supply chain steadied this caused our mix of lower margin covidrelated products to decline to approximately 31 of total safety product sales improving our overall safety product margin 3 our net rebates were favorable as supply chains normalized and demand improved we purchased more 

products through our traditional partners increasing our supplier rebates at the same time customer rebates moderated as spending from several key customers that purchased significant covidrelated products declined 

these variables were only partly offset by a 78 writedown of masks in the first quarter of 2021 the impact of pricecost was neutral to 2021 as we were able to lift prices in response to higher costs for products and transportation services the net impact of product and customer mix was also neutral to 2021 as the benefit of relatively stronger fastener sales to product mix was negatively impacted by relatively stronger growth from larger and onsite customers 

during 2020 our gross profit percentage decreased when compared to the prior year this decrease was primarily caused by three variables 1 a decline in product margin for safety and other products which itself reflects several trends first in the second quarter of 2020 in order to procure supplies we utilized unfamiliar supply chains and prioritized speed of acquisition over efficiency resulting in lower margins second in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 certain pandemic related products became oversupplied and profits on our inventory fell masks while other products were in such short supply that cost rose gloves we mitigated these effects as the year progressed but did not eliminate them third mix within these categories had a negative impact on margin as in general covidrelated products had lower margins and increased in the mix 2 a change in product mix fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers our fastener product line declined to 299 of sales in 2020 from 342 of sales in 2019 3 overhead and organizational expenses this includes the negative impact that reduced sales for certain product lines has on vendor rebates clearance efforts to remove older and slower moving inventory and the deleverage of certain fixed and period costs related to cyclical weakness in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets these three adverse variables were partly offset by a better cost profile for our captive fleet we operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers our distribution centers and our inmarket locations we believe this provides us a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to move product efficiently and quickly but there is a cost to supporting and maintaining these assets during periods of economic weakness it can become more difficult to charge freight to offset these costs andor the relatively stable cost profile of these assets could result in deleverage we successfully mitigated these challenges in 2020 by reducing movement and labor costs 

operating and administrative expenses 

our operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 70 basis points to 260 in 2021 from 253 in 2020 employeerelated expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 80 basis points occupancyrelated expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by approximately 10 basis points all other operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was largely unchanged in 2021 from 2020 our operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to 253 in 2020 from 273 in 2019 this improvement was a function of the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses being more modest than the growth in sales employeerelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 140 to 145 basis points in 2020 from 2019 occupancyrelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 25 to 30 basis points in 2020 from 2019 all other operating and administrative expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 to 45 basis points in 2020 from 2019 

the growth contraction in employeerela ted occupancyrelated and al l other operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment compared to the same periods in the preceding year is outlined in the table below 



employeerelated expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes 

our employeerelated expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 this was related to improvement in our sales and profitability generating significantly higher bonuses and commissions higher health insurance costs as e mployees became comfortable again in seeking noncovidrelated health care an increase in our profit sharing contribution and higher fulltime and parttime wages producing an increase in base pay  our employeerelated expenses decreased in 2020 from 2019 this was related to a decrease in fte headcount and related base wages and employment taxes related to efforts to reduce costs given weak demand in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets lower bonuses and commissions given weak demand in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets and reduced costs associated with the fastenal school of business as 

training shifted from inperson to online this was only partly offset by an increase in our profit sharing contribution and health care costs 

the table below summarizes the percentage change in our fte headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period 



1 our noninmarket selling employee count has grown in recent years due to an increased focus on resources to support our growth drivers particularly onsite and national account growth 

2 administrative primarily includes our sales support information technology finance and accounting human resources and senior leadership roles and functions our administrative employee count has also grown in recent years due to increased personnel investments in information technology and operational support such as purchasing and product development 

occupancyrelated expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our branches and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our inmarket operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses 

our occupancyrelated expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 this was related to the timing of development costs related to equipment utilized as part of our fmi suite of technologies depreciation related to a higher installed base of fmi devices and higher facility costs with higher costs for nonbranch facilities and utilities being only partly offset by slightly lower costs for branch facilities from branch closings our occupancyrelated expenses increased slightly in 2020 from 2019 this was primarily due to higher depreciation related to facility expansions completed in 2019 partly offset by lower utility costs in our branches 

all other operating and administrative expenses include 1 sellingrelated transportation 2 information technology it expenses 3 general corporate expenses which consists of legal expenses general insurance expenses travel and marketing expenses etc and 4 the gain on sales of property and equipment 

combined all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 this was related to higher spending on information technology higher spending on travel meals and supplies as business activity recovered from the covidrelated travel restrictions of 2020 and higher costs for legal settlements these elements were partly offset by lower bad debt expenses and lower general insurance costs combined all other operating and administrative expenses decreased in 2020 from 2019 this was related to lower sellingrelated freight expenses due to reduced travel as a result of covidrelated restrictions the rationalization of our branch fleet and significantly reduced travel and meal expenses due to reduced travel as a result of covidrelated restrictions this was partly offset by higher spending on information technology 

net interest expense 

our net interest expense was 96 in 2021 compared to 91 in 2020 and 136 in 2019 this was related to lower interest income as the special dividend paid in december 2020 resulted in lower interestearning cash balances in 2021 slightly higher interest expense which was the net result of slightly higher average interest rates and slightly lower average debt during the year we repaid one tranche under our master note agreement reducing the balance from 4050 to 3900 however in the fourth quarter of 2021 we increased our balance outstanding under our revolver by 250 to support working capital growth the decrease in 2020 when compared to 2019 was due to a slightly lower average debt balance paired with substantially lower interest rates during the year we increased the debt held under our master note agreement to 4050 as a means of fixing a portion of our debt and freeing up borrowing capacity under our revolver 

income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 2828 in 2021 or 234 of earnings before income taxes our effective tax rate reflects an 87 reduction in income tax expense due to discrete items mainly relating to benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions 

we recorded income tax expense of 2736 in 2020 or 242 of earnings before income taxes our income tax expense was reduced by 53 due to discrete items mainly relating to benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions 

net earnings 

net earnings net earnings per share eps the percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2021 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales translating into higher pretax profits as well as a lower income tax rate in 2020 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and higher operating profits and were only partly offset by an increase in income tax expense the increase in basic and diluted earnings per share also reflected the purchase of our shares of common stock 

results of operations comparison to 2019 periods 

given the unusual nature of our marketplace during 2021 and 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic we believe that a comparison of certain results of operations during the year and fourth quarter of 2021 to the same periods in 2019 provides further insight into sustainable trends and underlying performance of our business as discussed earlier in this report there were certain aspects of the covid19 pandemic that dramatically impacted our business during 2020 given this we believe that a comparison to the 2019 periods is helpful to demonstrate changes in financial condition and our results of operations during the most recently ended quarter and year the table below provides such a comparison 



liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2021 the decrease in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings is due to significant growth in working capital as we support growth in our customers operations as well as in the case of inventory significant product inflation this was only slightly mitigated by ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our working capital and contrasts sharply with 2020 when weaker demand from our customers resulted in working capital being a net source of operating cash in 2020 the increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings was due to working capital assets and liabilities being a modest source of cash in 2020 as opposed to a significant use of cash in 2019 this includes the deferral o f 300 in payroll taxes resulting from the cares act and a timingrelated higher accounts payable balance 

trade working capital assets 

trade working capital assets are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

in 2021 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflected several factors first our receivables are expanding as a result of improved business activity and resulting growth in our customers sales second in response to the covid19 pandemic customers that traditionally have shorter payment terms represented a smaller proportion of our sales mix at the end of 2021 than was the case at the end of 2020 in 2020 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflected growth in sales mitigated by the substantial increase in sales to government customers which tended to have shorter payment terms in 2020 and strong collections at year end 

our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable one reason for this is cyclical we source significant quantities of product from overseas and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns as a result trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions a second reason is our growth drivers including our fmi offerings onsite channel and international expansion all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory in 2021 our inventories increased reflecting significant inflation in the value of stocked parts and the addition of inventory to support the growth of our manufacturing and construction customers as they expand production to meet improved business activity and deeper inventory stocking due to disruption in supply chains in 2020 our inventories decreased reflecting a number of factors including reduced stocking needs on the part of our traditional manufacturing and construction customers due to weak business activity reduced vending and onsite signings and good execution on initiatives aimed at improving our inventory balances this was partly offset by covidrelated ppe balances that we added in the second quarter of 2020 and declined over the second half of 2020 but we had no such ppe inventory in the preceding year 

in 2021 the annual growth in accounts payable reflected product purchases increasing to support the improvement in business activity at our manufacturing and construction customers in 2020 the annual growth in accounts payable reflected primarily the timing of certain payments that slipped out of the fourth quarter of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



lease obligations 

we have facilities equipment and vehicles leased under operating leases a discussion of our lease obligations is contained in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was primarily related to the absence of an acquisition in contrast to the 1250 spent in 2020 for the purchase of certain assets of apex industrial technologies llc apex as well as lower net capital expenditures the changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 were primarily related to an increase of 1250 for the purchase of certain assets of apex which was partly offset by changes in our net capital expenditures 

property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of 1 purchases related to industrial vending 2 purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers 3 spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems 4 the addition of fleet vehicles 5 expansion improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties and 6 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business 

set forth below is a recap of our 2021 2020 and 2019 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings 



our net capital expenditures decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020 we had higher spending on an office building construction project in winona minnesota intended to support growth in our business this was more than offset by reduced spending in other areas we saw a significant decline in spending on fmi equipment due to slower hardware signings lower vending equipment costs following the march 2020 acquisition of certain industrial vending assets of apex and an increase in the refurbishment and redeployment of fmi hardware as an alternative to buying new devices we also had lower capital investment in our hub properties following a period of heavier investment in 2018 and 2019 and reduced spending on sellingrelated vehicles as challenges in the supply chain reduced availability our net capital expenditures decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 we reduced capital spending expectations early in 2020 across most tracked categories as financial uncertainty related to the pandemic response emerged the decline relates to lower spending on facility capacity and equipment following our investments in 2019 lower spending for vending devices as a result of our acquisition of certain assets of apex and lower signings lower spending on our captive fleet and lower spending for manufacturing equipment 

we expect our net capital expenditures in 2022 to be within a range of 1800 to 2000 this increase from 2021 reflects an increase in spending on fmi equipment in anticipation of higher signings an increase in spending on hub properties to reflect upgrades to and investments in automation as well as facilities upgrades and an increase in manufacturing capacity to support demand and expand capabilities this is partly offset by the absence of spending on our winona construction project which was completed in 2021 

  

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments proceeds from debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases 

in 2021 we did not purchase any shares of our common stock in 2020 we pu rchased 1600000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 3254 in 20 19 we did not purchase any shares of our common stock 

dividends 

we declared a quarterly dividend of 031 per sh are on january 18 2022  in 2021 we paid aggregate annual dividends per sha re of 112 in 2020 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 140 which included 100 in regular quarterly dividends and a 040 special dividend paid in december 2020 as a result of our high cash balances and favorable financial outlook 

debt 

in order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers pay dividends and in 2020 to purchase our common stock prepay vendors to secure access to critical products during the pandemic and acquire certain assets of apex we have borrowed under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility and master note agreement peaked during each quarter of 2021 and 2020 as follows 



as of december 31 2021 we had 250 outstanding under the credit facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 363 as of december 31 2021 we had loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 3650 descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

material cash requirements 

our material cash requirements for known contractual obligations include capital expenditures debt and lease obligations each of which are discussed in more detail earlier in this section we believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for these items in the shortterm over the next 12 months and also in the longterm beyond the next 12 months we also have cash requirements for purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services which are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities in addition we may have liabilities for uncertain tax positions but we do not believe any of these liabilities will be material a discussion of income taxes is contained in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings 

approximately 1785 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the tax act the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation 

in 2021 we experienced significant increases in the cost of metals especially steel energy and transportation costs especially overseas containers and shipping these inflationary trends meaningfully increased the cost of many of the products we purchase we were able to mitigate the adverse effects of higher costs on our gross profit percentage in 2021 by increasing prices seeking alternative sources for products and services and consolidating spend for products and services while the effects of inflation in 2021 was broadbased we did experience deflation for certain covidrelated products that had inflated in 2020 when the supply chain was disrupted this did require us to write down the value of these products in 2021 which negatively impacted our gross profit percentage in the first quarter of 2021 and to a lesser extent throughout the balance of the year in 2020 we experienced changing price levels for covidrelated supplies with inflation for certain products that were in short supply eg nitrile gloves and deflation for certain products that became oversupplied eg disposable masks these were eventspecific circumstances related to the pandemic as it related to the noncovid environment we experienced stable product costs through 2020 relative to 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances historical experience and actuarial valuations actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

our most significant accounting policies including revenue recognition and inventories are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations our most critical accounting estimates include the following 

allowance for credit losses – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

inventory valuation – adjustments to the valuation of inventory are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels sales information and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand market conditions condition of the inventory or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change our 

estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

general insurance reserves – these reserves are for general claims related to workers compensation property and casualty losses and other general liability selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends we perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels we analyze historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows italicized discussions throughout item 7a of this form 10k indicate discussions of market risks in 2020 we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments our operations in countries other than the us and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material during 2021 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our reported net sales by 374 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial during 2020 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our reported net sales by 57 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial 

commodity steel pricing – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners and related hardware we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers during 2021 the price of steel as reflected in many market indexes increased which contributed to cost inflation in our steelbased products based on our ability to pass these higher costs on the estimated effect on our net earnings was immaterial in 2021 during 2020 the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes fell sharply early in the year as business activity declined in response to actions to address the covid19 pandemic recovered sharply as business activity rebounded and finished 2020 above the preceding year end levels 

commodity energy prices – we have market risk for changes in prices of oil gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity during 2021 the price of energy as reflected in many market indexes increased as economic activity improved which contributed to higher costs for fuel in our vehicles and utilities at our facilities in 2021 our estimated net earnings exposure for commodity energy prices was immaterial during 2020 prices for energy were mostly lower as business activity declined in response to actions to address the covid19 pandemic as a result we experienced lower costs for fuel for our vehicles and utilities for our facilities 

fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell during 2021 prices for fossil fuels were generally higher which caused us to experience higher prices for products with high chemical or plastic content in 2021 our estimated net earnings exposure for materials for which fossil fuels are feedstock was immaterial during 2020 although fossil fuel prices were generally lower we experienced stable not lower prices for products with high chemical or plastic content we believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers the efficiency of ou r trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency 

interest rates  loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rate s tied to libor or if libor is no longer available at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the credit facility and consented to by us as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a one percentage point increase in libor in 2021 would have resulted in approximately 02 of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first branch in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximatel y 27000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines described later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2020 we had 3268 inmarket locations defined in the table below in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in north america 12 in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and one in europe and we employed 20365 people we believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement 

our channels to market 

we engage our customers primarily through branch and onsite locations branches and onsites exist very close to our customers usually within miles in the case of the former and most often within our customers physical locations in the case of the latter and together constitute our ‘inmarket’ network many of our customers engage with us through ecommerce but most of our sales through this channel are with customers that use ecommerce to supplement our service through our other channels 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each of the last ten fiscal years the number of branch onsite and total inmarket locations at the end of each of the last ten fiscal years their respective sales as well as the average monthly sales per location that were generated from our branch and onsite locations and our revenue generated from nontraditional sources 



1 revenues attributable to our traditional and international branch locations and our onsite locations respectively 

2 average sales per month considers the average active base of branches and onsites respectively in the given year factoring in the beginning and ending location count divided by total revenues attributable to our branch and onsite locations further divided by twelve months respectively this information is presented in thousands 

3 onsite information prior to 2014 is intentionally omitted while such locations have existed since 1992 we did not specifically track their number until we identified our onsite program as a growth driver in 2014 

4 this portion of revenue is generated outside of our traditional inmarket location presence examples of which include our custom inhouse manufacturing revenues arising from our leased locker arrangements and other nontraditional sources of revenue 

5 inmarket locat ions is defined as the sum of the total number of public branches and the total number of onsite locations 

this structure has evolved over time as a result of one of fastenals guiding principles since inception that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer through much of our history this was achieved by opening branches and more recently through new onsite locations today we believe there are few companies that offer our north american inmarket location coverage in 2020 roughly 54 of our sales an d 52 of our inmarket locations were in major metropolitan statistical 

areas msas populations in the united states and canada greater than 500000 people while 20 of our sales and 18 of our inmarket locations were in small msas populations under 500000 people and 26 of our sales and 30 of our inmarket locations were not in an msa in our view this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis maintaining operations that are physically proximate to our customers operations have represented and continue to represent the foundation of our service approach 

we have two primary versions of our branch locations  

1 a traditional branch typically services a wide variety of customers including our larger national and regional accounts as well as retail customers locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction companies we stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and over time where appropriate our district and branch personnel may tailor the inventory offering to the needs of the local customer base since fastenals founding and through 2013 traditional branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company and we experienced net openings each year over that time span however new growth drivers business models and business tools onsite vending digital solutions have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth traditional branches were entirely usbased until 1994 when we opened our first location in canada at the end of 2020 we had 1868 traditional branches in the united states and canada and they represented 586  of to tal sales 

traditional branches are also differentiated by their operating styles certain locations are customer service branches csbs which tend to feature a showroom regular hours during which it is open to the public and our standard stocking model of products designed for contractors csbs are similar in function to a hardware store and they often conduct some business with nonaccount or retaillike customers however this customer set typically represents less than 10 of sales at this type of location other locations operate as customer fulfillment centers cfcs which tend to feature a limited showroom reduced hours of access to the public greater usage of willcall and stock customerspecific inventory these tend to appear and function more like an industrial supply house and stocking location and tend not to have transactions with nonaccount or retaillike customers unless it is a will call arrangement related to an online transaction the choice of operating style is made by local leadership and is based on local market considerations 

2 an international branch is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada we first expanded outside of the united states and canada when we opened a branch in mexico in 2001 since then we have continued to expand our global footprint and at the end of 2020 we operated in 23 countries outside of the united states and canada mexico is the largest of these and we also operate in europe asia and central and south america our gotomarket strategy in countries outside of the united states and canada focuses primarily on servicing large national account customers disproportionately concentrated in manufacturing from a product perspective these customers are more heavily oriented toward planned fastener spend though nonfastener mro spend is becoming more common in these markets despite strong growth in our international business in recent years we are not as well recognized in many of our locations outside of the us and canada as we are in the us and canada however our ability to provide a consistent service model including vending bin stocks and onsites on a global basis is attractive to our foreign customer base much of which are the foreign operations of north americanbased companies at the end of 2020 we had 135 international branches operating outside the us and canada and they represented 49 of total sales 

traditional and international branches sell to multiple customers we will continue to open traditional branches as the company sees fit however in each year since 2013 the company has experienced a net decline in its total branch count including net declines of 111 branches in 2020 113 branches in 2019 and 156 branches in 2018 our total decline since 2013 is 684 branches 

onsite locations may influence the trend in our traditional branch count over time but are not the primary reason for our traditional branch closings the onsite concept is not new in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992 however it was largely a local option that grew slowly before we identified it as a growth driver in 2014 we have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015 in this model we provide dedicated sales and service to a single customer from a location that is physically within the customers facility or in some cases at a strategically placed offsite location with inventory that is specific to the customers needs in many cases we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch location though we are beginning to see more new customer opportunities arise as a result of our onsite capabilities the model is best suited to larger companies though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors it has been our experience that sales mix at our onsite locations produces a lower gross profit percentage than at our branch locations but we gain revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is lower we have identified over 15000 manufacturing and construction customer locations in the united states with potential to implement the onsite service model these include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today as well as potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence however as awareness of our capabilities has grown we have identified additional onsite potential with certain agencies of state provincial and local government customers and academia we also believe as we follow our existing national account customers outside the united states our market potential for onsite solutions will continue to expand the international opportunity is substantial but our speed is limited by the relatively underdeveloped infrastructure in comparison to the united states we expect revenues from onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time we experienced net increases of 151  220 and 289 onsite locations in 

2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and signed 223 362 and 336 new onsite locations in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we had 1265 onsite locations as of december 31 2020 and they represented 263 of total sales we believe the marketplace can support 375 to 400 new onsite signings annually and our goal in 2021 is to sign that many locations however we recognize that achieving the goal will be challenging as the continued prevalence of covid19 infections has made gaining access to customer facilities and decisionmakers difficult 

we believe the profitability of our inmarket locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site in any inmarket location certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable such as employeerelated expenses while others like rent and utility costs tend to be fixed as a result it has been shown that as an inmarket location increases its sales base over time it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin this ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by 1 general growth based on end market expansion andor market share gains 2 the age of the inmarket location new locations tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and in the case of a traditional branch the time necessary to generate a customer base andor 3 rationalization actions as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional branch base there are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market factories may have closed our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches andor our customers may have transitioned to our onsite model an onsite may also close because local or regional management determines that the business at the location is unlikely to scale sufficiently to justify our being on premise in which case the relationship often reverts to being managed in a local traditional branch the paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an onsite location as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employeerelated expenses in the short term the onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged 

the following table provides a summary of the public branches and onsite locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the openings closings and conversions during each year

5 the net impact of noninmarket locations or onsite locations converted to branches branches converted to onsite locations or noninmarket locations and closures of branches or onsite locations 

we utilize additional types of selling locations within our network but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number comprising less tha n five percent of our total selling locations we remain committed to a large robust service network including traditional branches it r emains the indispensable foundation of our business in any given year it is difficult to predict whether our total branch count will rise or fall how ever with the growth we anticipate in onsite locations we believe our total inmarket locations will increase over time 

our business tools 

fastenal managed inventory fmi 

over time we have invested in and developed various technologies that allow us to put physical product closer to the point of use in a customer location increase the visibility of a customers supply chain to the customer as well our personnel andor improve the ability to monitor or control usage while there are isolated exceptions these technologies are not themselves channels to the market but rather are utilized by our branch and onsite channels to enhance service to our customers collectively these tools form our fastenal managed inventory fmi capabilities we believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers fmi programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and coupled with our fully integrated distribution network foster a strong relationship with customers 

we introduced industrial vending fast vend in 2008 to provide our customers with improved product monitoring and control benefits include reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and we believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive inmarket network of inventory and local personnel for these reasons the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and we finished 2020 with approximately 110700 devices in the field approximately 15000 of which relate to a locker lease program with a specific retail customer our discussion generally focuses on the approximately 95700 product revenue devices we believe industrial vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support we estimate the market could support as many as 17 million industrial vending devices and as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time 

our industrial vending portfolio consists of 24 different vending devices with 15 of these being in either a helix or locker format our most utilized models include the helixbased fast 5000 and our 12 and 18door lockers combined these comprise approximately 70 of our installed base of devices these are either configurable or are available in multiple configurations to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers target monthly revenues per device typically range from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 with our flagship fast 5000 device having a targeted monthly throughput of 2000 

bin stock fast stock and fast bin programs where product is held in bins in a customer facility is similar to our vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities such programs which we call fast stock have existed in the industrial supply industry for a considerable time with open bins being clustered in a racking system each of which holds original equipment manufacturing oem fasteners maintenance repair and operations mro fasteners andor nonfastener products that are consumed in the customers operations historically these bins were simply plastic containers that held product and were visually inspected by our customers or fastenal personnel to determine replenishment need these bins in some cases are organized and labeled into customer planograms which allow for the scanning of product when product is at a minimum desired level however in 2019 we introduced our fast bin technology which we began to more aggressively commercialize in 2020 fast bin is the evolution of fast stock into a set of electronic inventory management solutions that automate process controls by providing 247 continuous inventory monitoring realtime inventory visibility and more efficient replenishment of bin stock parts these technologies come in three forms 1 scales utilize a highprecision weight sensor system to measure the exact quantity on hand in real time automatically sending an order to fastenal when inventory hits an established minimum 2 infrared uses infrared sensors lining individual bins to provide realtime visibility of approximate quantity and inventory values automatically sending an order to fastenal when inventory hits an established minimum threshold 3 rfid is a kanban system that utilizes rfid tags so that when an empty bin is removed from the rack and placed in a replenishment zone also part of the same racking system an automatic refill order is generated these technologies provide superior monitoring capabilities these capabilities provide immediate visibility to consumption changes allowing for a lean supply chain avoiding stock outs and providing a more efficient labor model for both the customer and the supplier 

we plan on changing our reporting of fmi beginning in 2021 historically we have reported only on fast vend however the development and commercialization of fast bin and its digital capabilities combined with industrial vending provides us with a broader suite of tools with which to best manage our customers product consumption and fulfillment which we believe 

will enhance our ability to manage and grow our oem and mro fasteners hydraulics and pneumatics and other product offerings further we view the valueadd offered to our customers by fast bin as it relates to product monitoring and data collection to be comparable to our industrial vending solution as a result beginning in 2021 we will begin to report weighted fmi device signings and installations which is the combined activity of fast vend and fast bin converted into a comparable unit of measure or machine equivalent unit meu this conversion takes the targeted monthly throughput of each fmi device signed or installed and compares it to the 2000 target monthly throughput of our fast 5000 vending device for example an rfid enclosure with target monthly revenue of 2000 would be counted as 100 machine equivalent 20002000  100 an infrared bin with target monthly revenue of 40 would be counted as 002 machine equivalent 402000  002 in 2021 we anticipate weighted fmi device signings to be in a range of 23000 to 25000 meus similar to onsite however we recognize that achieving the goal will be challenging as the continued prevalence of covid19 infections has made gaining access to customer facilities and decisionmakers difficult 

the tables below contain information on how the presentation of weighted fmi devices differs from the industrial vending information product revenue devices on signings and installations that we have previously provided 





digital solutions 

we also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers leverage local inventory for sameday solutions and provide efficient service while there is a transactional element to our digital services many of the solutions we invest in are intended to add value to customers by illuminating various elements of their supply chain these solutions take many forms 

1 transactional our transactional or ecommerce platforms web verticals or integrated catalogs provides a means for our customers to effectively and efficiently procure mro and unplanned spend one of our ecommerce solutions fastenal express guides our customers to products which are locally stocked capitalizing on our existing location footprint in order to provide sameday or early nextday service for online orders this positions us to outperform what is most typically a 24 to 48hour fulfillment expectation while there is a retail component to our transactional digital services most of the revenue attributable to this is with our traditional customer base nearly all of which purchase digitally as a supplement to other channels and tools that it utilizes with fastenal we attribute the revenue generated from a customer location through our transactional platforms to the inmarket location that traditionally services that customer location 

2 digital visibility certain of our digital capabilities are intended to produce operational efficiencies for our customers and ourselves andor to deliver strategic value by illuminating customer supply chains for instance we have developed and continue to develop mobility applications one example of which is our vending app which provides a number of benefits it provides easy realtime information pertaining to a customers local inventory position within their pointofuse devices it 

incorporates customer usage data to recommend optimized parts and quantity for specific devices improving customer inventories while reducing stockouts moving our fulfillment process from a vending devicebased keypad function to a tablet or scanning interaction improves the restock process reducing time consumed greater efficiency while improving accuracy improved quality assurance we will continue to build out our suite of apps we also have eprocurement solutions electronic data interchange edi is the connectivity between our system and our customers procurement systems – whether a direct integration into their enterprise resource planning erp system or through a thirdparty procurement network or marketplace these solutions provide systemtosystem exchange of electronic procurement documents such as purchase orders advanced shipping notices and invoices for direct and indirect spend our eprocurement solutions provide a bridge between our fmi replenishment activity and our customers procurement systems – creating an efficient accurate and streamlined procuretopay p2p process fast 360 acts as the bridge between our fmi footprint and a customers view into our managed service model fast 360 surfaces data around these managed services as one central source of information as we manage our customers oem and mro product lines this is achieved through our fmi technologies providing locational data around our fast vend fast bin and fast stock footprint and fast 360 being the means of surfacing that data and activities to our customers 

3 analytics we provide solutionbased digital platforms eg web verticals or integrated catalogs which leverages our existing strategic environment by creating a means of migrating online spend offline which illuminates our supply chain capabilities this is marketed under the fast 360 analytics label as it is an enterprisecentric extension of the digital visibility capabilities of fast 360 we bring value to our customers as well as ourselves by using these digital platforms and analytics to shift product from a nonsticky transactional environment which is online to a sticky strategic environment which is our fmi programs we create customer cost savings opportunities through this directive by lowering the total cost of ownership tco as the objective is to shrink the unplanned – high cost – purely transactional spend bucket 

we believe our integrated physical and virtual model when paired with our national and increasingly international scope represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to ecommerce as an independent sales channel we expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time 

we believe our global channels to market and business tools including those that we consider to be growth drivers onsites international expansion fmi and digital solutions represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed this is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and sticky service combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling inmarket and otherwise and nonselling engineering product specialists manufacturing etc employees we offer a range of capabilities that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate 

we operate fifteen regional distribution centers in north america twelve are in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina kansas and mississippi – and three are outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico we also operate one distribution center in europe located in dordrecht netherlands these distribution centers give us approximately 46 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our inmarket locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier with approximately 77 of our north american inmarket locations receiving service four to five times per week the distribution centers in indiana and kansas also serve as master hubs with those in california and north carolina serving as secondary hubs to support the needs of the inmarket locations in their geographic regions as well as provide a broader selection of products for the inmarket locations serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california north carolina kansas and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems asrs these eleven distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 95 of our picking activity we expect to add andor expand new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our inmarket locations increases 

our information systems team develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate digital distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of custom inhouse developed purchased and subscription licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including growth through customer service ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business we have registered or applied for the registration of various 

trademarks and service marks our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the united states as long as they are in use their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use 

products 

fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies this includes threaded fasteners bolts nuts screws studs and related washers as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as pins machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories our fastener product line which is primarily sold under the fastenal product name represented 299 342 and 349 of our consolidated net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

fastener distribution is complex in most cases the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight this presents challenges in moving product from suppliers most of whom are outside of north america to our distribution centers as well as from our distribution centers to our branch onsite and customer locations at the same time fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products construction projects and maintenance and repair while also exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application in many cases a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime andor effective use these features have greatly influenced our logistical development training and educational programs support capabilities and inventory decisions which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate 

in 1993 we began to aggressively add additional product lines and these represented 701 658 and 651 of our consolidated sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively these products which we refer to as nonfastener product lines tend to move through the same distribution channel get used by the same customers and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line this logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering however over time the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line for instance nonfastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending 

the most significant category of nonfastener products is our safety supplies product line which accounted for 255 179 and 172 of our consolidated sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively this product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years which we believe is directly attributable to our success in industrial vending over that period the exception to this is the significant increase in safety sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales in 2020 which is directly attributable to dramatic increases in demand for personal protective equipment ppe in response to the covid19 pandemic in that year our tools product line represented approximately 82 99 and 100 of consolidated net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in the last several decades we have added private label brands often referred to as exclusive brands or brands sold exclusively through fastenal to our nonfastener offering these private label brands represented approximately 13 of our consolidated net sales in each of 2020 2019 and 2018 we believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our nonfastener sales for two reasons 1 branded vs private label dynamics of fasteners differ from those of nonfasteners and 2 nonfastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business private label brands represented approximately 18 19 and 19 of our total nonfastener sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our percentage of private label brand sales as a percentage of our total nonfastener sales in 2020 declined due to strong growth of covidrelated ppe which was not sold under a private label brand while demand was weak for other safety products many o f which are marketed under a private label brand and were more greatly affected by economic weakness in our traditional manufacturing and construction customers prior to 2020 we generally had experienced increases in sales of private label products as a percentage of total nonfastener sales when looking at specific sales channels such as onsite locations branches and vending however these increases were masked by the relative sales growth we were experiencing with onsite locations which typically have a lower percentage of total sales being private label than is the case in branches or sales through vending devices 

we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 3 of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems by our sales personnel at inmarket locations by our district and regional leadership and by our product development team the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum stocking level all branches stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as 

deemed appropriate by the district and branch personnel nonbranch selling locations primarily onsites stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

inventory held at our selling locations close to customers and available on a sameday basis accounted for approximately 59 60 and 61 of our total inventory at the end of 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 41 40 and 39 of our total inventory at the end of 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the distribution center and manufacturing location inventory when combined with our trucking network allows for fast nextday service at a very competitive cost 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2020 approximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  cardinal fasteners ®  and spensall ® product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to the repair of tools and hoists the fabrication of chain sling and hose band saw blade welding and other light manufacturing and fabrication we may add additional services in the future however we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect them to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales in the future 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control  no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2020 

in the case of fasteners and our private label nonfastener products we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area asia within asia suppliers in china represent a significant source of product as a result the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions 

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers and historically has represented approximately 65 of our business the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors and historically has represented approximately 1015 of our business other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades 

based on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing and nonresidential construction our business has historically been cyclical however we believe our model has certain protections that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes first we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing and nonresidential construction market although slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries locally or globally however we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions in addition while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities this latter source of revenue tends to be directly influenced by cyclical changes but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic 

in 1995 we developed a national accounts program aimed at making our products and services more competitive with customers that operate multiple facilities these customers tend to have more complex supply chains and structures for managing the oem and mro products we provide while at the same time by virtue of their size and opportunity have more negotiating power we believe our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint our ability to provide a consistent level of hightouch service and broad product availability and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing quality control and product knowledge are attractive to these larger customers we believe our advantage with 

these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels such as onsite fmi digital solutions and resources to serve these customers unique demands as a result in 2020 national accounts represented 550 of our sales compared to 536 and 507 in 2019 and 2018 respectively we believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percent of our total sales over time 

in an inmarket location our customers business activity is tracked through active accounts customers often have more than one active account at a single inmarket location reflecting their utilization of different fastenal services and frequently have active accounts at many inmarket locations across our global network during the fourth quarter of 2020 our total number of active customer account s defined as accounts having purchase activity totaling at least 100 within the last 90 days was approximatel y 218000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts with purchase activity of at least 500 per month within the last 90 days was approximately 77000 during 2020 we had a single customer that represented 5 of our consolidated net sales whereas all remaining customers fell below that threshold during both 2019 and 2018 no single customer represented 5 or more of our consolidated net sales 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local inmarket selling personnel as well as our nonbranch selling personnel we support our sales team with multichannel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing print and radio advertising targeted campaigns promotional flyers and events in recent years our national advertising has been focused on a nascar ® sponsorship through our partnership with roush fenway racing ® as the primary sponsor of the no 17 car in the nascar ® cup series driven by chris buescher in 2020 our sports marketing efforts were extended when the national hockey league nhl ®  awarded us as the preferred mro supplier of the sport 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales the first and fourth quarters are typically our lowest volume periods given their overlap with winter months in north america during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather the fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the thanksgiving october in canada and november in the united states christmas and new year holiday periods due to plant shut downs in contrast the second and third quarters typically have higher revenues due to stronger nonresidential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays although good friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of july will always fall in the third quarter 

competition 

our business is highly competitive and includes large national distributors whose strongest presence tends to be in more densely populated areas and smaller regional or local distributors which compete in many of the smaller markets in which we have branches we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products in no particular order are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

market strategies in industrial distribution are varied with respect to products many of the larger distributors have trended toward a broadline offering over time however they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share this association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors though many smaller competitors do deploy a broadline model means of serving the customer are even more diverse for instance many competitors maintain a local branchbased presence in their markets while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales recent years have seen the emergence of ecommerce solutions such as websites and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors it also has introduced nontraditional webbased competitors into the marketplace the diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base the large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels from a single distributor or from a range of distributors to procure the products they need in their operations 

we believe that better service and a competitive selling advantage can be provided by maintaining a physical selling and stocking presence closer to the customers locations as a result we maintain branches in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products the convenience of a large number of branches in a given area combined with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending and bin stock solutions supported from an inmarket location provides a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each inmarket location also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local branch the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low incremental investment given the existing branch and distribution structure 

human capital resources 

employees 

at the end of 2020 we employed 20365 full and parttime employees of these approximately 72 held an inmarket or nonbranch selling role we characterize these personnel as follows 



1 our noninmarket selling employee count has grown in recent years due to an increased focus on resources to support our growth drivers particularly onsite and national account growth 

2 administrative primarily includes our sales support information technology finance and accounting human resources and senior leadership roles and functions our administrative employee count has also grown in recent years due to an increased focus on technology capabilities for example 667 of the increase in administrative employees in 2020 over 2019 related to our additions to our information technology teams 

employee profile 

as of december 31 2020 we had 20365 employees worldwide with 16820 of those employees located within the united states us 2277 employees located in canada and mexico and 1268 employees located overseas in 22 other countries throughout the world approximately 72 of our employees maintain customerfacing sales roles directly interacting with our customers on a daily basis from one of our 3268 inmarket locations the remaining population of our workforce comprise our inhouse manufacturing capabilities 31 our captive transportation and distribution functions 176 and our administrative support functions 74 supporting our sales force and continuing to drive value for our customers 

based on our 2019 eeo1 data which is our most recently filed information in the united states females and minorities constitute 245 and 209 of our workforce respectively based on us bureau of labor statistics data we believe fastenal’s mix of female and minority employees is consistent with if not higher than the proportion of females and minorities working in manufacturing and construction which is representative of the pool of employees from which we might draw candidates relative to 2012 our female and minority workforces have grown 22x and 30x faster respectively than our overall us workforce 

health and safety 

employee health and safety continues to be a priority in every aspect of our business we’ve taken a multifaceted approach to safety that helps us understand and reduce hazards in our business trainings audits inspections risk assessments safety coaching and employee engagement are all programs that help us consistently manage our facility and employee safety our internal scorecard system and safety management system ensures we maintain focus on a variety of risks while we sustain an inclusive safety environment that contributes to innovation and improved performance we continue to expand and evolve our safety programs to better meet our employee needs and workplace conditions as our business grows 

this commitment to and continuous improvement towards a safer work environment for our employees has generated excellent results a widely accepted measure of organizational health and safety is the experience modification rate emr an organization’s emr is established through the comparison of a company’s past and expected losses incurred through workplace injury against industry averages which are compiled by the national council on compensation insurance and consider unique variables such as the size and characteristics of an organization industry averages are benchmarked at a 100 emr with a reduction in the rate being reflective of an organization’s ability to implement superior safety procedures and protocols resulting in a safer environment and reducing both personnel and financial risk in 2020 the most recent year for which this figure has been calculated fastenal had an emr of 045 which is 55 better than the average performance rate for our industry 

2020 was unique for the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on organizations including ours our response has consistently evolved to meet the turbulent environment 

• the business continuity team implemented regular communication regarding impacts of the covid19 pandemic including health and safety protocols and procedures 

• implementing a hierarchy of controls to address hand washing social distancing cleaning areas and frequency personal protective equipment and resources to stay up to date on the changing conditions 

• deployment of face covers dispensed through our vending technology across the company for use in areas where they are required and recommended 

• prohibiting all domestic and international nonessential travel for all employees 

• providing additional days of leave for full and parttime employees to cope with the illness 

• restricting access to our nonpublic facilities such as corporate offices distribution centers sales offices and manufacturing locations 

• providing public branch access by appointment or pickup only in high risk areas 

• implementation of risk assessments in critical operating facilities 

• implementing protocols to address actual and suspected covid19 cases and potential exposure 

• working closely with customers to meet their specific covid19 requirements and maintain service 

• providing all of our employees with frequent updates to share stories of how we were helping customers and each other disclosing covid19 statistics within the organization 

we understand the benefits of employee health and safety and continue to invest in programs products and resources we also understand the environment of trust and fairness that exists when information is openly shared as an essential provider of personal protective equipment to critical customers we also continue to invest in products and services to meet the health and safety needs of our customers and communities 

employment and compensation philosophy 

fastenal’s success is defined by our people our cultural values – ambition  integrity  innovation and teamwork – are woven into the fabric of our human resources processes and protocols and inform our employment and compensation philosophies 

several principles underpin our employment philosophy one is decentralization placing employees close to our customers operations and trusting these employees to independently make local decisions to provide differentiated local service a second is that we are a passionately promotefromwithin company guided by a belief that if you work hard make great decisions learn from mistakes and exemplify our cultural values you should receive greater opportunity and responsibility 

we believe these principles cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset and foster an environment of trust and empowerment 

as it relates to our compensation philosophy we believe our combination and mix of base and bonus pay motivates our people to high levels of individual and company success as the goals and objectives have been repeatedly demonstrated to be achievable with superior effort we are guided by simple principles 1 programs should be easy to understand with goals and objectives that are clearly communicated and resources for success that are provided they should be calculable by the employee and numbersdriven eg not subjective 2 total compensation should have a significant component that is based on how well the employee has grown their piece of the business and served our customers 3 employees should receive incentives as soon as practical upon attainment of the goal 

approximately 72 of our employees interface directly with customers on a daily or frequent basis with the remainder supporting the selling efforts of our customerfacing employees typical pay arrangements provide a base amount paid periodically during the month along with a major opportunity to earn bonus amounts paid monthly based on growth in sales gross or pretax profit achieved and prudent management of working capital in certain roles there may also be a portion of compensation based on contribution to attaining predetermined departmental or project and cost containment goals most focused on either customer service or better execution of companywide activities 

because we believe the growth in the companys stock value should be the reward for achieving longterm success consistent with being an owner we have a stock option plan in the case of certain foreign employees we have a stock appreciation rights plan all of our employees are eligible to receive stock option grants or stock appreciation rights 

we believe our combination of short and longterm rewards and incentives has proven successful as reflected in our historic performance and acceptable levels of employee retention and turnover 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good 

talent acquisition and development 

fastenal’s values are integral to our employment process and serve as guideposts for leadership the ultimate goal is straightforward find great people ask them to join and give them a reason to stay reasons include training opportunity and a welcoming environment from a practical standpoint this means that we attract a broad group of candidates and then hire the candidate who is the best match for the position based on their skills and abilities in accordance with our decentralized leadership structure we believe the person best suited to make this decision is the local leader trying to fill the opening in light of our promotefromwithin philosophy we know we are hiring a potential future leader with every new hire 

our human resources department develops efficient processes to expand our reach and pool of diverse talent while balancing the needs and requirements of data collection and storage we have created a standardized framework for posting jobs and interviewing for positions supplemented with training through the fastenal school of business we have a diversity and compliance team that is heavily involved in developing this standardized framework which ensures its integrity not only is this process followed for all new hires we replicate the same procedures for any internal transfers and promotions 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program known as fsb develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific training and development programs that are offered to our employees the programs are offered through a combination of classroom instructorled training virtual instructorled training and online learning fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective branch best practices sales and marketing products supply chain and distribution 

product sourcing endeavors 

sourcing from suppliers with good standing is the foundation of an ethical supply chain we expect our suppliers to comply with all regulations and standards and we conduct risk analysis for suppliers who want to do business with us to obtain additional supporting documentation affirming their ethics quality and reliability so we can be certain they meet our standards in these areas and to ensure that they are complying with fastenals supplier terms  code of conduct and global supplier purchase order terms  conditions as we are subject to the conflict minerals rules with the help of thirdparty resources and global databases scanning over 100 lists of agencies known risk adverse media and financial status fastenal monitors key areas of traderelated risk including dualuse goods and utilization of sanctioned countries or entities as these are common ways that international trade might provide capital and restricted goods to sanctioned parties launder funds of drug traffickers and otherwise support criminals we also evaluate our suppliers approach to labor to ensure that they are using appropriate and appropriately compensated employees 

with a local and global supplier base continuous monitoring and local representation is a necessity to ensure protocols are triggered when risk may be evident ensuring a safeguard against poor andor impaired quality and regulatory violations that may otherwise impact our reputation in the marketplace this is performed not only at the time of supplier vetting and onboarding but for the life of the relationship with the supplier this process promotes a supply chain that is supportive of fastenals supplier terms  code of conduct and global supplier purchase order terms  conditions in the event of noncompliance or potential risk we work with the supplier to correct the situation if remediation efforts are not undertaken to ensure the supplier remains in compliance with fastenal’s standards and code of conduct alternative sources for supply may be considered to ensure the integrity of our supply chain supply chain compliance representatives are placed in international corporate offices to ensure global coverage and governance ensuring that no matter where a customers operations may take them fastenal has the infrastructure resources and internal processes established to perform its supply chain governance obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

operational risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner could disrupt operations cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues and result in less efficient operations the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities still information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us it is also possible that we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our information systems our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data as well as the success of our growth drivers is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable or if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations it could adversely affect our profitability andor ability to grow 

cyber security incidents or violations of data privacy laws and regulations could cause us to experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event including any cyber security event but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our effor ts the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely there can be no ass urance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our consolidated financial statements while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace in addition regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new privacy security laws and regulations including the european union general data protection regulation 2016 the california consumer protection act and other similar state privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges which may increase compliance costs and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers within north america and abroad in recent years we have increased the resources devoted to our growth drivers including fmi onsites national accounts digital 

solutions and our international operations while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to sales growth and due to the covid19 pandemic our growth drivers did not contribute meaningfully to higher sales in 2020 failure to achieve any of our goals regarding fmi onsites national accounts digital solutions and international operations or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth further failure to identify appropriate targets for our onsite channel and fmi tools or failure to persuade the appropriate targets to adopt these offerings once identified may adversely impact our goals regarding the number of new onsite locations we are able to open or the number of fmi installations we are able to deploy 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume or timing of orders have caused and could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future changes in our customer or product mix have caused our gross profit percentage to decline and could cause our gross profit percentage to further fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing for approximately twenty years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic our sales were impacted by surge sales of pandemicrelated supplies such as ppe and other safetyrelated products that have traditionally lower gross profit margins similarly in recent years revenues from national accounts andor onsite customers which typically have lower gross profit margins by virtue of their scale available business and broader offering of products which typically have lower gross margins have tended to grow faster than revenues from smaller customers customer and product mix have contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage over time including in 2020 and 2019 and will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in 2021 and beyond however whether and to what extent this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are or are not offset by positive impacts to gross profit margin during such year downward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume or timing of our orders and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline for example in the second quarter of 2020 we had to quickly purchase large volumes of pandemicrelated products from nontraditional sources and nonoptimized supply chains which had a negative impact on gross profit we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances we may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace 

our operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings over time we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses including costs related to payroll occupancy freight and information technology among others as our net sales have grown however historically a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins there are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past for instance it is typical that when demand declines most commonly from cyclical or general market factors though it could be due to customer losses or some other companyspecific event our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales it is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales in addition market variables such as labor rates energy costs and legal costs could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable us to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings should any of these scenarios or a combination of them occur in the future it is possible that our operating and pretax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue 

our competitive advantage in industrial vending fast vend and bin stock fast stock and fast bin tools could be eliminated and in the case of fast vend the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services could be impactful and result in failure to deploy devices we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock due to our hardware and software our local branch presence allowing us to service devices and bins more rapidly our depth of products that lend themselves to being dispensed through industrial vending devices or bin stocks and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending and bin stock position with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending and bin stock tools or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending devices used in our fast vend platform while these devices software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in us failing to meet our goals related to the number of devices we are able to deploy in the next twelve to eighteen months in addition our ability to expand deployment of our industrial vending and bin stock tools could be limited by events similar to the covid19 pandemic if customers shift their energy to shortterm disruptions instead of longterm strategic planning 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete our ability to generate additional sales and our profit margins our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the selling location level and identify future products and product 

lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including inside and outside branch associates onsite managers national account sales representatives and support personnel who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high particularly for less tenured employees if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels 

our inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership in the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight andor leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles in addition difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team or recruiting suitable replacements could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations 

we may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or nontraditional competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although slowly consolidating still remains a large fragmented and highly competitive industry our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing technological and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources technological advancements and services increased competition from brickandmortar retailers could cause us to lose market share reduce our prices or increase our spending similarly the emergence of online retailers whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major nontraditional competitors could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods these pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage over time 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy including in the us the california consumer privacy act and in the european union the general data protection regulation 2016 with interpretations varying from state to state and country to country and cyber security requirements including protection of information and incident responses regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such 

violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results we are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties further our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected positively or negatively by changing tax priorities changes in statutory rates andor changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof the most significant recent example of this is the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which was enacted in the united states in december 2017 there is a longerterm risk that the beneficial aspects of the tax act on our business could be reversed depending on changes in future fiscal or political priorities 

industry and general economic risks 

operational risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

• general business conditions 

• business conditions in our principal markets 

• interest rates 

• inflation 

• liquidity in credit markets 

• taxation 

• government regulations and actions including around trade policy 

• energy and fuel prices and electrical power rates 

• unemployment trends 

• terrorist attacks and acts of war 

• acts of god which may include but are not limited to weather events earthquakes pandemics etc and 

• other matters that influence customer confidence and spending 

a downturn in either the national or local economy where we operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our inmarket locations sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those inmarket locations and other selling channels 

this risk was demonstrated in 2019 and 2020 we experienced strong demand in 2017 and 2018 that produced doubledigit sales growth for fastenal our growth slowed into the midsingle digits beginning in the second quarter of 2019 as many of our customers involved in the manufacture of components capital goods and heavy equipment were impacted by higher costs and reduced confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty when this happens these customers tend to cut back on spending which yields a slowdown in our business with these customers in the second and third quarters of 2020 the reaction to the covid19 pandemic resulted in sharply reduced spending by our traditional customers as they implemented shutdowns social distancing and safety policies however the weakness that was experienced by many of our business units in the second and third quarters of 2020 was more than offset by sales of pandemicrelated supplies such as ppe and sanitation products to traditional and less traditional eg government and healthcare customers while we intend to retain some of these less traditional customers as regular buyers of safety and other products once the pandemic subsides it is uncertain whether they will continue to purchase products from us 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse 

effect on our operations and business the covid19 pandemic began to impact our operations late in the first quarter of 2020 and may continue to affect our business particularly should government authorities impose mandatory closures workfromhome orders andor social distancing protocols seek voluntary facility closures andor impose other restrictions should such actions be taken it could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations impair our ability to sustain sufficient financial liquidity and impact our financial results the covid19 pandemic has had some favorable impacts on our financial results through much of 2020 however as supply chains adapt to the environment it is not certain that those favorable impacts will recur in the future to offset any resumption of public access restrictions we might impose on our branches or reductions in capacity by our customers including facility closures the covid19 pandemic has also produced shifts in the mix of our business resulting from a decrease in sales of our fasteners and increases in sales through our safety business based on the traditionally lower gross profit margin percentage of our safety business these shifts have contributed to a lower gross profit margin percentage for us this impact on our gross profit margin percentage may persist in the short term until the impacts of covid19 start to moderate it is also possible that the impact on our gross profit margin percentage will be long term in the event that covid19 alters customer purchasing patterns to include a sustainably higher 

mix of safety and sanitation products as we cannot predict the duration or scope of the covid19 pandemic the net financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated but it could be material and last for an extended period of time 

trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly and could adversely impact our gross andor operating profit percentage we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of north america primarily asia we have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from asia through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources this was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production but over time we have expanded our nonfastener sourcing as well and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term in light of this changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers andor impact the cost or price of our products with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results these risks most recently manifested in an increase in tariffs primarily in 2018 and 2019 either directly on products we trade in or indirectly on industries we sell into between the united states and its trading partners as well as greater uncertainty around regional and global trade agreements generally china represents a significant source of product for north america in addition we move and source products within north america any trading disruption tariffs product restrictions etc between canada the united states and mexico or disruption in their respective trading relationships with other nations can adversely impact our business there can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business the degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies their timing and duration and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues in particular the united states tariffs levied on most of our products originating in china have caused us to review and implement potential solutions to the increase in our product costs with our customers the effectiveness of these strategies in response to any future tariffs is unknown 

trade policies could have an adverse impact on industries we sell into negatively affecting our net sales and profits considerable political uncertainty in the united states may result in changes to trade policies that could create disruption in geographic demand trends to the extent that the united states government enacts tariffs or taxes that penalize imports to benefit domestic manufacturing we may improve our domestic sales which may have an overall positive impact on us given that 85 of our total revenue is derived from the united states however any such action may adversely impact our foreign sales which may in turn adversely impact our ability to expand our overseas branches in the future in addition should a foreign government engage in its own trade protection independent of or in response to another nations action it could have a negative direct or more likely indirect effect on our net sales and profits by reducing demand for exports by united states companies such changes could adversely affect our financial results this dynamic would apply to every country in which we operate but no other country represents more than 10 of our net sales 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available for reasons unrelated to trade policy which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disease disruption or delays in shipments or changes in local economic conditions additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial or other difficulties our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing equally appealing products and services 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs can fluctuate significantly over time increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and branch operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass higher supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit to decline or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products 

customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that north american market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed 140 billion this figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreedupon demand and market share statistics instead we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources if we have overestimated the size of our market and in doing so underestimated our current share of it the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe similarly we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies such as industrial vending and onsite locations within north america we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 17 million devices and we have identified over 19000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model within our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base we have identified additional markets such as government healthcare and academia and geographies into which we can sell our fmi solutions which would increase the number of identified potential industrial vending or customer locations however our presence in emerging markets and geographies is not as established as is the case in our traditional markets and geographies which could extend the sales cycle similar to the case for total market size we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales because our company was started in the united states and because we are publiclytraded in the united states we report our results based on the united states dollar because the functional currency related to most of our nonunited states operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure if we decide to do so in the future we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

credit and liquidity risks 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results as of december 31 2020 we had 4050 of outstanding debt obligations consisting entirely of senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement in the aggregate principal amount of 4050 we did not have loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility as of december 31 2020 loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on november 30 2023  the notes issued under our master note agreement consist of eight series and are described in further detail in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the market turmoil of 2020 did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased we currently have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return the cost of servicing any existing balances on our credit facility at that time could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility in july 2017 the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom the governing body responsible for regulating libor announced that it no longer will compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make libor submissions after 2021 the cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of libor has since been extended until mid2023 but it is uncertain when applicable tenors of libor will cease to exist and whether additional reforms to libor may be enacted but libor is still expected to cease to be the reference rate for commercial loans and other indebtedness our credit facility currently uses libor as a reference rate and while there are customary libor replacement provisions in our credit facility the transition to alternatives to libor could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets while we do not believe that the impact would be material to us given the usage of our credit facility we do not yet have insight into what the impacts might be in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high 

general risk factors 

there can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time stock prices including ours are commonly thought to be a function of earnings compounded by a multiple this is often referred to as a pricetoearnings or pe ratio historically investors have given our earnings a higher multiple or premium than is typical of the broader industrial sector of which we are typically associated we believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth profitability and returns however to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies andor poorly navigate the risks that surround our business including those described throughout this section or to the extent our industry industrial distribution or industrial stocks in general loses favor in the marketplace there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2020 2018 and prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of over 3200 inmarket locations most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes sales of products for both original equipment manufacturing oem where our products are consumed in the final products of our customers and manufacturing repair and operations mro where are products are consumed to support the facilities and ongoing operations of our customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our branches onsite locations and customers are primarily located in north america 

it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big we estimate the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america and no company has a significant portion of this market 2 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive but the cost and time to manage procure and transport these products can be quite meaningful 3 purchasing professionals often expend disproportionate effort managing the high stock keeping unit sku count of lowvolume low value mro supplies which is better allocated to their higher volume higher value oem supplies 4 many customers prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business while also utilizing various technologies and models including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly to improve availability and reduce waste 5 we believe the markets are efficient to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customer 

our approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto growth through customer service  the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind our customerfacing resources to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we strive to generate strong profits which produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers lastly we identify drivers that allow us to get closer to our customers and gain market share 

we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can serve our customers at the closest economic point of contact at one point the closest economic point of contact was the local branch today in many cases we have moved the branch inside the customers facility we also are frequently positioned right at the point of consumption within customers facilities through our suite of fmi devices and capabilities therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles by doing these things every day fastenal remains a growthcentric organization 

impact of covid19 on our business 

in the second quarter of 2020 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business were dramatic in two respects first local and national actions taken such as stayathome mandates reduced business activity sharply as many customers either closed their locations or operated at significantly diminished capacity this effect was illustrated in a significant decline in sales for our fastener products second social actions taken to mitigate the effects of the pandemic produced significant demand for personal protection equipment ppe and sanitation products generating significant sales of such products not only to certain traditional customers but also to state and local government entities as well as front line responders this effect was illustrated by a significant increase in sales for our safety products during that period improved sales of ppe and sanitation products more than offset the general economic weakness these dynamics affected our business throughout the second quarter of 2020 but the effects were greatest in april with sequential improvements in may and june as business restrictions gradually eased 

the pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our business in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 the marketplace broadly and fastenal specifically continued to operate with certain modifications to balance reopening with employee and customer safety however most of the markets in which we operate began to normalize in the second half of 2020 this improved the outlook of the manufacturing and construction customers that support our traditional branch and onsite business and moderated the level of demand for ppe and sanitation products that we experienced at the onset of the pandemic we 

believe that the sequential gains in economic activity that we experienced in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 continued through the third and fourth quarters of 2020 although the rate of improvement remains gradual 

consistent with broader social trends we have taken steps to safeguard the health of our employees this includes closing branch and corporate facilities to outside personnel adjusting work schedules to maximize social distance creating space between work areas providing ample ppe and cleaning supplies having formal policies for mitigation in the event of cases of illness utilizing technologies where work duties allow to enable work from home capabilities and utilizing technologies such as vending and mobility to create social distancing due to these precautions our operations have continued to function effectively including our internal controls over financial reporting 

while there are exceptions our customers have largely continued to operate their businesses despite a continued high rate of viral infections that exist as of this date in contrast to the second quarter of 2020 when many temporarily suspended operations still there remains significant uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the covid19 pandemic factors deriving from the covid19 response that have or may negatively impact sales and gross margin in the future include but are not limited to limitations on the ability of our suppliers to manufacture or procure from manufacturers the products we sell or to meet delivery requirements and commitments limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local state or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis with respect to liquidity as of the end of 2020 we have substantially all of our 7000 bank revolver available for use in the event that the need arises 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers and shareholders while we are unable to determine or predict the nature duration or scope of the overall impact the covid19 pandemic will have on our business results of operations liquidity or capital resources we believe that it is important to share where our company stands today how our response to covid19 is progressing and how our operations and financial condition may change as the fight against covid19 progresses 

executive overview 

net s ales increased 3137 or 59 in 2020 relative to 2019 our gross profit increased 523 or 21 in 2020 relative to 2019 and as a percentage of net sales declined to 455 in 2020 from 472 in 2019 our operating income increased 845 or 80 in 2020 relative to 2019 and as a percentage of net sales increased to 202 in 2020 from 198 in 2019 

our net earnings in 2020 were 8591 an increase of 86 when compared to 2019 our diluted net earnings per share were 149 in 2020 compared to 138 in 2019 an increase of 84 

although we continued to market our growth drivers in 2020 covid19 created an environment that was not conducive to the level of signings we would have expected under normal business conditions at the same time significant resources shifted to focus on rapidly and efficiently securing transporting and providing ppe to new and existing customers that found themselves managing shortterm crisis conditions brought on by the pandemic these dynamics produced signi ngs of just 223 new on site customer loca tions and 16417 new industrial vending devices in 2020 those same dynamics also produced very strong daily sales growth of 510 in our safety product line and 1297 from government and healthcare customers in the period which more than offset the low growth driver signings and weak activity in our traditional manufacturing and construction customer base 

the table below summarizes our absolute and fulltime equivalent fte based on 40 hours per week employee headcount our investments in inmarket locations defined as the sum of the total number of public branch locations and the total number of active onsite locations and industrial vending devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period 



1 this number primarily represents devices which principally dispense product and produce product revenues and excludes approximately 15000 devices that are part of a locker lease program where the devices are principally used for the checkincheckout of equipment 

during the last twelve months we reduced our total fte employee headcount by 1132 this reflects a decline in our inmarket fte employee headcount of 976 as well as declines in headcount at our distribution centers and manufacturing operations these reductions are primarily related to efforts to manage expenses in response to weaker demand from traditional manufacturing and construction customers resulting from the covid19 pandemic this was only partly offset by additions in nonbranch selling and support roles the latter most significantly reflects an increase in personnel in information technology which includes the addition of employees from our acquisition of certain assets of apex as well as roles to support customer acquisition and implementation particularly as it relates to our growth drivers and to support general corporate functions 

we opened twelve branches and closed 123 branches net of conversions in 2020 we activated 257 onsite locations and closed 106 net of conversions in 2020 the number of closings reflects both normal churn in our business whether due to redefining or exiting customer relationships the shutting or relocation of a customer facility or a customer decision as well as our ongoing review of underperforming locations our inmarket network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open or close locations as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network support our growth drivers and manage our operating expenses 

results of operations 

the following sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information as a percentage of net sales for the periods ended december 31 



net sales 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period the table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended december 31 and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period 



the increase in net sales noted above for 2020 was a function primarily of higher unit sales for safety products specifically pandemicrelated sales of ppe the effect of higher prices during the period were not material the increase in net sales noted above for 2019 was a result of higher unit sales and to a lesser degree higher prices higher product prices in 2019 were a result of actions taken to offset increases in product costs and we believe these increases contributed 09 to 10 to sales growth during 2019 

higher unit sales in 2020 were heavily influenced by actions taken by governments and businesses around the world to address covid19 which influenced the period in a couple of ways first by virtue of our ability to source and transport ppe we were able to supply the needs of governments first responders and businesses as they worked to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our communities and normalize business activity under more stringent safety protocols this generated significant ppe sales through the year we believe the best proxies for this trend was daily sales growth of our safety products of 510 an d daily sales growth to our government and healthcare customers o f 1297 se cond we managed the effects of business closures disruption in labor forces and supply chains and a reduction in general business activity that was a byproduct of the responses of governments and businesses to the pandemic the impact of this is best illustrated by several metrics for instance united states industrial production which is published by the federal reserv e decreased 71 in 2020 based on the large proportion of our sales that are derived from the united states we believe united states industrial production is a good proxy for the state of our marketplace and that the significant dec line in this metric is consistent with the weakness we experienced in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets this was also reflected in the daily sales of fasteners which is our most cyclical product line daily sales of fasteners d eclined 72 in 202 0 although traditional manufacturing and construction business activity has gradually but steadily improved from depressed second quarter of 2020 levels it did remain negative through the year taking these two variables together higher unit sales of ppe more than offset the decline in unit sales in our traditional manufacturing and construction business resulting in higher net unit sales in 2020 

our growth drivers did not contribute meaningfully to higher unit sales in 2020 which we believe is largely a function of difficulties gaining access to customers and facilities due to social distancing and safety guidelines in response to covid19 we signed 16417 industrial vending devices during 2020 a decrease of 249 from 2019 this did increase our installed base to 95733 devices at the end of 2020 an increase of 64 over 2019 but this increase was not sufficient to offset reduced throughput per device as a result sales through our vending devices declined at a low singledigit rate during 2020 we activated 257 new onsite locations in 2020 a decrease of 176 over 2019 this allowed us to increase our active sites to 1265 at the end of 2020 an increase of 136 over 2019 but this increase was not sufficient to offset significant sales declines in our older more established onsite locations as a result sales through our onsite locations declined at a low singledigit rate during 2020 we did experience growth in our national account customers of 67 in 2020 compared to 2019 though this was due to the sale of ppe to customers navigating the challenges of operating during a pandemic 

the higher unit sales in 2019 resulted primarily from two sources first was higher underlying market demand as illustrated by us industrial production which increased 08 in 2019 and daily sales of fasteners which grew 55 in 2019 it is notable however that underlying demand in 2019 began strong but weakened throughout the year referring again to us industrial production it increased 29 in the first quarter of 2019 but decreased 09 in the fourth quarter of 2019 the slowing in these metrics from the start to the end of 2019 mirrored the slowing growth we experienced in our unit sales over the same period 

a relatively greater contributor to our growth in 2019 was the success of our growth initiatives we signed 21857 industrial vending devices during 2019 while this represented a slight decrease in signings of 10 from 2018 it also contributed to growth in our installed base to 89937 vending devices at the end of 2019 an increase of 108 over 2018 growth in our installed base was primarily responsible for sales growth through our vending devices in the midteens during 2019 we signed 362 new onsite locations in 2019 an increase of 77 over 2018 and had 1114 active sites on december 31 2019 an increase 

of 246 over december 31 2018 growth in our number of active sites was primarily responsible for sales growth through our onsites in the midteens during 2019 the contribution of new national account contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 119 in 2019 compared to 2018 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from fasteners safety supplies and all other product lines was as follows 



shifts in product mix in 2020 largely reflects the factors that impacted our sales growth in the period specifically strong demand for ppe generated strong sales growth in our safety products while weak trends in underlying conditions affected our traditional manufacturing and construction customers resulting in a sales decline in our fastener products the effect on other products was relatively muted as certain lines benefited from pandemicrelated demand such as janitorial products while others were negatively impacted by underlying demand such as metalcutting and material handling shifts in product mix in 2019 were based on more traditional factors the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales arises from two factors first we believe nonfastener products represent a larger market opportunity than fasteners and that we are relatively underrepresented in this market over time this has led to faster growth in the nonfastener product lines a trend amplified by the growth of our industrial vending program through which we sell primarily nonfastener products we believe this factor impacted 2019 and will continue to promote a lower mix of fasteners in our total sales over time second the weakening industrial production environment had a disproportionately negative effect on fastener sales particularly oem fasteners sales relative to nonfastener sales which relates more to plant operations than production this weakness is more of a cyclical factor than a structural one and as such was relevant in 2020 albeit overwhelmed by pandemicrelated effects and 2019 

annual sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

annual sales changes by month 

during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 



sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days andor seasons impact certain end markets particularly nonresidential construction the first landing centers on easter and the good friday holiday that precedes it which alternates between march and april good friday occurred in april in 2020 and 2019 occurred in march during 2018 and will fall in april in 2021 the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our nonresidential construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average 20152019 we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2020 2019 and 2018 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 20delta 19delta and 18delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year under normal circumstances the sequential trends shown below are directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets further in any given month it is possible to get significant deviation from the benchmark however we do not believe that fully explains the exaggerated delta between the sequential rates of change and the benchmark from march 2020 to july 2020 we believe deviation of this duration and order of magnitude is uncharacteristic in our business and is related to the dramatic impacts of the pandemic in that period 

it is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages in a year where demand is strong our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it in a year where demand is weak we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it in both cases there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform 



1 the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

we estimate approximately 65 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market the daily sales growth contraction rates to these manufacturing customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line which under normal business conditions represents 30 to 35 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth contraction rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



the daily sales growth contraction rates of fasteners noted in the table above for first quarter of 2018 include 37 percentage points attributable to mansco acquired on march 31 2017 

by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



two product lines safety and janitorial accounted for approximately half of total nonfastener sales and saw a meaningful increase in sales in 2020 due to demand generated in response to the covid19 pandemic as a result the change in our nonfastener lines in 2020 did not provide as much insight into the trends of our traditional manufacturing and construction customers as is typically the case still we have sold nonfastener products through multiple cycles that do not include a pandemic and believe we can make several observations generally speaking our nonfastener business is not immune to the impact of industrial cycles however we would typically expect it to outperform our fastener business in any cycle this reflects three things the nonfastener market is larger than the fastener market we are underpenetrated in the nonfastener market relative to the fastener market and industrial vending lends itself to sales of nonfastener products this is what we experienced in 2019 the outperformance of our nonfastener business was far more dramatic in 2020 than can be explained by our traditional drivers of outperformance and reflects the impact of covid19 on our sales of safety products specifically ppe and janitorial products such as sanitizer and wipes 

our nonresidential construction and reseller customers have historically repres ented 20 to 25 of our business though in 2020 it was slightly below the bottom of this range the daily sales growth contraction rates to t hese customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



our nonresidential construction and reseller business is heavily influenced by manufacturing oil and gas and infrastructure spending in 2020 and 2019 the poor and slowing production environment respectively and as described above and the accompanying worsening trends for commodities such as metals and energy caused the growth in our nonresidential construction and reseller customers to slow in 2020 this was exacerbated by project suspensions as many states and regions shut down activity in an effort to control the pandemic 

gross profit 

the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 455 in 2020 and 472 in 2019 the gross profit percentage for 2020 decreased by 170 basis points based on three items 1 a decline in product margin for safety and other products which itself reflects several trends first in th e second quarter of 2020 in order to procure supplies we utilized unfamiliar supply chains and prioritized speed of ac quisition over efficiency resulting in lower margins second in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 certain pandemic related products became oversupplied and profits on our inventory fell masks while other products were in such short supply that cost rose gloves we mitigated these effects as the year progressed but did not eliminate them third mix within these categories was negative to margin as in general covidrelated products had lower margins and increased in the mix 2 a change in product mix fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers our fastener product line declined to 299 of sales in 2020 from 342 of sales in 2019 3 overhead and organizational expenses this includes the negative impact that reduced sales for certain product lines has on vendor rebates clearance efforts to remove older and slower moving inventory and the deleverage of certain fixed and period costs related to cyclical weakness in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets these three adverse variables were partly offset by a better cost profile for our captive fleet we operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers our distribution centers and our inmarket locations we believe this provides us a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to move product efficiently and quickly but there is a cost to supporting and maintaining these assets during periods of economic weakness it can become more difficult to charge freight to offset these costs andor the relatively stable cost profile of these assets could result in deleverage we successfully mitigated these challenges in 2020 by reducing movement and labor costs 

during 2019 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily caused by three variables 1 a change in product and customer mix as we experienced the combination of relatively slow net sales growth in our fastener product line and relatively faster net sales growth to our largest customers for which national accounts is a good proxy and which tend to have lower margins 2 we experienced rising freight expense as a result of costs related to transporting products particularly shipping fees driver wages and fuel 3 we experienced an increase in the cost of our products due to generalized inflation and tariffs resulting from disputes between the united states and its trade partners we implemented several actions to mitigate the impact of these cost increases in 2019 including price increases for the full year the net impact of these actions was minor however the impact through the year differed with a larger negative impact on the gross profit percentage in the first half of 2019 and a relatively modest impact in the second half of 2019 

operating and administrative expenses 

our operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment as a percentage of net sales improved to 253 in 2020 from 273 in 2019 this improvement was a function of the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses being more modest than the growth in sales employeerelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 140 to 145 basis points in 2020 from 2019 occupancyrelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 25 to 30 basis points in 2020 from 2019 all other operating and administrative expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 to 45 basis points in 2020 from 2019 

our operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment as a percentage of net sales improved to 273 in 2019 from 282 in 2018 this improvement was a function of the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses being more modest than the growth in sales employeerelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 40 to 45 basis points in 2019 from 2018 occupancyrelated expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 20 to 25 basis points in 2019 from 2018 all other operating and administrative expenses improved the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 20 to 25 basis points in 2019 from 2018 

the growth contraction in employeerela ted occupancyrelated and al l other operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment compared to the same periods in the preceding year is outlined in the table below 



1 employeerelated expenses fell within a range of 6873 of our total operating and administrative expenses during 2020 during 2019 employeerelated expenses fell within a range of 6570 of our total operating and administrative expenses 

employeerelated expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes 

our employeerelated expenses decreased in 2020 from 2019 this was related to a decrease in fulltime equivalent fte headcount and related base wages and employment taxes related to efforts to reduce costs given weak demand in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets lower bonuses and commissions given weak demand in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets and reduced costs associated with the fastenal school of business as training shifted from inperson to online this was only partly offset by an increase in our profit sharing contribution and health care costs our employeerelated expenses increased in 2019 from 2018 this was related to 1 an increase in fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution and options awards 4 increases in hourly base wages and 5 increased health care costs 

the table below summarizes the percentage change in our fte headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period 



1 our noninmarket selling employee count has grown in recent years due to an increased focus on resources to support our growth drivers particularly onsite and national account growth 

2 administration primarily includes our sales support information technology finance and accounting human resources and senior leadership roles and functions our administrative employee count has grown in recent years due to an increased focus on technology capabilities for example 667 of the increase in administrative employees in 2020 over 2019 related to our additions to our information technology teams 

occupancyrelated expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our branches and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our inmarket operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expenses 

our occupancyrelated expenses increased slightly in 2020 from 2019 this was primarily due to higher depreciation related to facility expansions completed in 2019 partly offset by lower utility costs in our branches our occupancyrelated expenses increased in 2019 from 2018 this was related primarily to higher depreciation as a result of facility expansions completed during the year and increases to industrial vending equipment 

all other operating and administrative expenses include 1 sellingrelated transportation 2 information technology it expenses 3 general corporate expenses which consists of legal expenses general insurance expenses travel and marketing expenses etc and 4 the gain on sales of property and equipment 

combined all other operating and administrative expenses decreased in 2020 from 2019 this was related to lower sellingrelated freight expenses due to reduced travel as a result of covidrelated restrictions the rationalization of our branch fleet and significantly reduced travel and meal expenses due to reduced travel as a result of covidrelated restrictions this was partly offset by higher spending on information technology combined all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2019 from 2018 this was related to higher spending on information technology and higher sellingrelated freight expense 

net interest expense 

our net interest expense was 91 in 2020 compared to 136 in 2019 and 123 in 2018 the decrease in 2020 when compared to 2019 was due to a slightly lower average debt balance paired with substantially lower interest rates during the year we increased the debt held under our master note agreement to 4050 as a means of fixing a portion of our debt and freeing up borrowing capacity under our revolver this debt has various maturities and interest rates which collectively are at attractive levels the increase in 2019 when compared to 2018 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance during the period 

income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 2736 in 2020 or 242 of earnings before income taxes our income tax expense was reduced by 53 due to discrete items mainly relating to benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions 

we recorded income tax expense of 2528 in 2019 or 242 of earnings before income taxes our income tax expense was reduced by 26 as a result of applying guideline clarifications issued by the irs on certain aspects of tax reform as well as tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options this reduced our tax rate in the period by 30 basis points 

net earnings 

net earnings net earnings per share eps the percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



1 as a result of the tax act discrete tax items benefited our net earnings by 71 during 2018 

during 2020 and 2019 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and higher operating profits and were only partly offset by an increase in income tax expense the increase in basic and diluted earnings per share also reflected the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2020 the increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings is due to working capital assets and liabilities being a modest source of cash in 2020 as opposed to a significant use of cash in 2019 this includes the deferral o f 300 in payroll taxes resulting from the cares act and a timingrelated higher accounts payable balance in 2019 the increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings reflects a reduced drag from working capital investment than what was experienced in 2018 and to a lesser degree higher net income 

trade working capital assets 

trade working capital assets are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

in 2020 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects growth in sales mitigated by the substantial increase in sales to government customers which tended to have shorter payment terms in 2020 and strong collections at year end in 2019 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects not only our growth in sales but also the fact that our growth is being driven disproportionately by our national accounts program where our customers tend to have longer payment terms than our customer base as a whole growth was also relatively stronger with customers outside the us which similarly tend to have longer payment terms than our customer base as a whole the rate of growth in receivables did slow throughout 2019 largely reflecting the impact on receivables of softer business activity 

our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable one reason for this is cyclical we source significant quantities of product from overseas and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns as a result trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions a second reason is our growth drivers including our fmi offerings onsite channel and international expansion all of which tend to require significant investments in inventory in 2020 our inventories decreased reflecting a number of factors including reduced stocking needs on the part of our traditional manufacturing and construction customers due to weak business activity reduced vending and onsite signings and good execution on initiatives aimed at improving our inventory balances this was partly offset by covidrelated ppe balances that we added in the second quarter of 2020 and have been declining over the second half of 2020 but we had no such ppe inventory in the preceding year in 2019 our inventories increased to support higher sales reflecting large increases in the number of installed vending devices and active onsite locations and from inflation and tariffs 

in 2020 the annual growth in accounts payable reflected primarily the timing of certain payments that slipped out of the fourth quarter of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021 in 2019 the slight decrease in accounts payable came as a result of softer year end business activity 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2020 were primarily related to an increase of 1250 for the purchase of certain assets of apex industrial technologies llc which was partly offset by changes in our net capital expenditures the changes in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures 

property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of 1 purchases related to industrial vending 2 purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers 3 spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems 4 the addition of fleet vehicles 5 expansion improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties and 6 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business 

set forth below is a recap of our 2020 2019 and 2018 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings 



our net capital expenditures decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 we reduced capital spending expectations early in 2020 across most tracked categories as financial uncertainty related to the pandemic response emerged the decline relates to lower spending on facility capacity and equipment following our investments in 2019 lower spending for vending devices as a result of our acquisition of certain assets of apex and lower signings lower spending on our captive fleet and lower spending for manufacturing equipment our net capital expenditures increased in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased spending on hub property and equipment both to expand current capacity and for potential future expansion higher spending on vending devices to support the growth of our industrial vending program and investment in our trucking assets 

we expect our net capital expenditures in 2021 to be within a range of 1700 to 2000 this increase from 2020 relates to increased spending for a nonhub construction project in winona to support growth higher maintenance spending across most tracked categories following tighter spending control in 2020 and lower anticipated proceeds from asset sales these factors will be slightly offset by lower spending on vending devices due to a full year of lower unit cost following our acquisition of certain assets of apex we anticipate funding our capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and if necessary from our borrowing capacity

net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments proceeds from debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases 

in 2020 we pu rchased 1600000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 3254 in 20 19 we did not purchase any shares of our common stock in 2018 we purchased 4000000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 2575 per share 

dividends 

we declared a quarterly dividend of 028 per share on january 19 2021 in 2020 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 140 this included 100 in regular quarterly dividends and a 040 special dividend paid in december 2020 as a result of our high cash balances and favorable financial outlook in 2019 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 087  

debt 

in order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers pay dividends and in 2020 to purchase our common stock prepay vendors to secure access to critical products during the pandemic and acquire certain assets of apex industrial technologies llc we have borrowed under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility and master note agreement peaked during each quarter of 2020 and 2019 as follows 



as of december 31 2020 we had no loans outstanding under the credit facility and had contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 363 as of december 31 2020 we had loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 4050 descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings 

approximately 1868 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the tax act the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation 

in 2020 we experienced changing price levels for covidrelated supplies with inflation for certain products that were in short supply eg nitrile gloves and deflation for certain products that became oversupplied eg disposable masks these were eventspecific circumstances related to the pandemic as it related to the noncovid environment we experienced stable product costs through 2020 relative to 2019 we experienced higher product costs through 2019 relative to 2018 as a result of generalized inflation and tariffs though the impact of these items did moderate later in the year as economic activity slowed and conditions around trade stabilized we took actions during the year to mitigate the effects of higher product costs including increasing product prices these actions were not able to offset the pressure we experienced on our gross profit percentage in the first half of 2019 but were more effective at doing so in the second half of 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances historical experience and actuarial valuations actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

our most significant accounting policies including revenue recognition and inventories are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations our most critical accounting estimates include the following 

allowance for credit losses – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the allowance for credit losses is based on an income statement approach which adjusts the ending balance sheet to take into consideration expected losses over the contractual lives of the receivables considering factors such as historical data as a basis for future expected losses if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

inventory valuation – the valuation of inventory is based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels sales information and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product our methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand market conditions condition of the inventory or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required adjustments have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

general insurance reserves – these reserves are for general claims related to workers compensation property and casualty losses and other general liability selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends we perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels we analyze historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

new accounting pronouncements 

a description of new accounting pronouncements is contained in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 3 and note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form 10k under the heading forwardlooking statements and item 1a risk factors 

certain contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding longterm debt and facilities equipment and vehicles leased under operating leases our future obligations to pay principal of and interest on such longterm debt and to make minimum lease payments under such operating leases are as follows 



1 interest on the longterm debt outstanding under our credit facility was calculated using the interest rates and balances at december 31 2020 

2 amounts include lease liabilities for pickup truck leases which typically have a noncancelable lease term of less than one year and are not included on the consolidated balance sheets as an operating lease rightofuse asset 

purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above our purchase orders are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities 

liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these liabilities which we believe will be immaterial a discussion of income taxes is contained in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments our operations in countries other than the us and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been m aterial in 2020 changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our reported net sales by 57 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial 

commodity steel pricing – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners and related hardware we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers during 2020 the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes fell sharply early in the year as business activity declined in response to actions to address the covid19 pandemic recovered sharply as business activity rebounded and finished 2020 above the preceding year end levels during 2019 the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes declined 

commodity energy prices – we have market risk for changes in prices of oil gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity prices for gasoline and diesel were mostly lower over the course of 2020 as business activity declined in response to actions to address the covid19 pandemic as a result we experienced lower fuel costs through most of 2020 in 2019 prices for gasoline and diesel were stable in the early part of the year but began to decline in the latter part of the year with slowing economic activity as a result we experienced stable fuel costs through 2019 fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell although fuel prices were lower through much of 2020 we experienced stable not lower prices for products with high chemical or plastic content stable fuel costs in 2019 resulted in stable product costs we believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers the efficiency of ou r trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency in 2020 our estimated net earnings exposure for commodity energy prices was immaterial 

interest rates  loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rate s tied to libor or if libor is no longer available at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the credit facility and consented to by us as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a one percentage point increase in libor in 2020 would have resulted in approximately 13 of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first branch in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 27000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines described later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2019 we had 3228 inmarket locations defined in the table below in 25 countries supported by 15 distribution centers in north america 12 in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and we employed 21948 people we believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year as well as the number of public branches onsite locations and total inmarket locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



1 onsite location information prior to 2014 is intentionally omitted while such locations have existed since 1992 we did not specifically track their number until we identified our onsite program as a growth driver in 2014 

2 inmarket locations is defined as the sum of the total number of public branches and the total number of onsite locations 

one of fastenals guiding principles since inception is that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer through much of our history this was achieved by opening branches and more recently through new onsite locations today we believe there are few companies that offer our north american inmarket location coverage in 2019 roughly 53 of our sales and 53 of our inmarket locations were in major metropolitan statistical areas msas populations in the united states and canada greater than 500000 people while 19 of our sales and 17 of our inmarket locations were in small msas populations under 500000 people and 28 of our sales and 30 of our inmarket locations were not in an msa in our view this has proven to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis branches have represented and continue to represent the foundation of our service approach however we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our branch network and in recent years we have developed additional models that get us still closer to the customer including vending bin stocks and onsite locations 

we currently have several versions of selling locations 1 a traditional or public branch typically services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of products we offer both as part of our standard stocking model and tailored to specific customer needs 2 an overseas branch focuses on manufacturing customers and our fastener product line though nonfasteners are becoming more common in these markets and is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada and 3 an onsite location provides dedicated sales and service from within or in close proximity to the customers facility we utilize additional types of selling locations within our network but these tend to be more specialized in nature and relatively few in number comprising less than five percent of our total selling locations 

traditional and overseas branches sell to multiple customers and together comprise the majority of our total selling locations onsite locations which serve a single customer are not included in our total branch counts however outside of the fact that they serve a single customer we believe the function and operation of an onsite location is similar to that of a branch this model also represents a meaningful portion of the companys total revenue and we expect that share to grow materially over time as a result we refer to our network in terms of inmarket locations which includes our total branches and onsite locations 

branch locations are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction companies we stock all branches with inventory drawn 

from all of our product lines and over time where appropriate our district and branch personnel may tailor the inventory offering to the needs of the local customer base since fastenals founding and through 2013 branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company and we experienced net openings each year over that time span we have long maintained that marketplace demographics could support a north american network of 3500 traditional branches however since establishing this figure new growth drivers and business models onsite vending digital solutions have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth it is now unlikely that we will operate the total traditional branch locations we previously believed would be the potential of north america we will continue to open traditional branches as the company sees fit however in each year since 2013 the company has experienced a net decline in its total branch count including net declines of 113 branches in 2019 156 branches in 2018 and 120 branches in 2017 

onsite locations may influence the trend in total branch count over time but are not the primary reason for our branch closings the onsite concept is not new in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992 however we identified it as a growth driver in 2014 and have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015 in this model we service a customer from a location that is physically within the customers facility or in some cases at a strategically placed offsite location with inventory that is specific to the customers needs in many cases we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch though we are beginning to see more new customer opportunities arise as a result of our onsite capabilities the model is best suited to larger companies though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors it has been our experience that gross profit percentages at onsite locations tend to be lower than at branches but we gain significant revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is materially lower we have identified over 15000 customer locations with potential to implement the onsite service model these include customers with which we have an existing national account relationship today as well as potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence we expect revenues from onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time we experienced net increases of 220 289 and 204 onsite locations in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and signed 362 336 and 270 new onsite locations in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we had 1114 onsite locations as of december 31 2019 and anticipate signing 375 to 400 new onsite locations in 2020 

we first went international when we opened a branch in canada in 1994 since then we have continued to expand our global footprint and at the end of 2019 we operated in 24 countries outside of the united states canada and mexico are the largest of these representing approximately 11 of total sales collectively and we also operate in europe asia and central and south america this remaining international business is approximately 3 of total sales our gotomarket strategy in countries outside of north america focuses primarily on servicing large national account customers from a product perspective these customers are more heavily oriented toward planned fastener spend though in recent years the international business has been growing faster than the us business we are not as well recognized in many of our foreign locations as we are in the us and to a lesser extent canada however our ability to provide a consistent service model including vending bin stocks and onsites on a global basis is attractive to our foreign customer base much of which are the foreign operations of usbased companies our international subsidiaries now have 479 inmarket locations including 179 onsite locations have over 11800 vending devices installed and employ over 3600 people from around the world 

the following table provides a summary of the public branches and onsite locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the openings closings and conversions during each year

5 the net impact of noninmarket locations or onsite locations converted to branches branches converted to onsite locations or noninmarket locations and closures of branches or onsite locations 

in 1995 we developed a national accounts program aimed at making our products and services more competitive with customers that operate multiple facilities these customers tend to have more complex supply chains and structures for managing the original equipment manufacturing oem and maintenance repair and operations mro products we provide while at the same time by virtue of their size and opportunity have more negotiating power we believe our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint our ability to provide a consistent level of hightouch service and broad product availability and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing quality control and product knowledge are attractive to these larger customers we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels such as industrial vending onsite fastenal managed inventory fmi ®  digital solutions and resources to serve these customers unique demands as a result in 2019 national accounts represented 536 of our sales compared to 507 and 482 in 2018 and 2017 respectively we believe sales to national accounts customers will continue to increase as a percent of our total sales over time 

we introduced industrial vending in 2008 vending provides our customers the benefits of reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and we believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive inmarket network of inventory and local personnel for these reasons the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and we finished 2019 with approximately 105000 devices in the field 90000 generating product revenue and 15000 in a locker lease program our discussion generally focuses on the 90000 product revenue devices we believe vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to 

streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support we estimate the market could support as many as 17 million industrial vending devices and as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time we anticipate signing 22000 to 24000 new devices in 2020 

our industrial vending portfolio consists of 23 different vending devices with 15 of these being in either a helix or locker format our most utilized models include the helixbased fast 5000 which is approximately 40 of our installed base of devices and our 12 and 18door lockers which combined are approximately 35 of our installed base of devices the lockers are available in multiple configurations and the helix format is configurable to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customers target monthly revenues per device typically range from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 depending on the type of device and products dispensed the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of device and 2 machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as 0375 machine equivalent 0375  7502000

in addition to industrial vending noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide fastenal managed inventory fmi programs also known as keep fill or bin stock programs in the industry to numerous customers this business relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners fmi is like our industrial vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities however the device is typically an open bin which is clustered with other bins in a racking system each of which holds oem fasteners mro fasteners andor nonfastener products that are consumed in the customers operations these bins utilize a variety of technologies for instance some bins are organized and labeled into customer planograms which allow for the scanning of product when product is at a minimum desired level and requires replenishment while other systems utilize scales to measure the volume of a bins content by its weight in 2019 fastenal introduced additional technology utilizing remote frequency identification rfid and infrared ir systems to bring additional value to the supply chain rfid automates a standard kanban program and ir automates the replenishment of individualized work stations we believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers fmi programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and coupled with our fully integrated distribution network that allows us to manage these programs for all sizes of customers foster a strong relationship with customers as we are often their preferred supplier 

we also invest in digital solutions that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers leverage local inventory for sameday solutions and provide efficient service these solutions take many forms for instance the above noted technologies vending and fmi provide locational data that we can utilize to provide strategic value to our customers an example of this is fast 360 which surfaces data around our managed services providing our customers with one central source of information as we 

manage their oem and mro products we also provide eprocurement solutions electronic data interface or edi and punchouts these provide systemtosystem exchange of documents such as purchase orders advance shipping notices and invoices for direct and indirect spend through a direct integration into our customers enterprise resource planning erp systems or through a third party procurement network or marketplace this creates an efficient accurate and streamlined procuretopay process we also have an ecommerce offering that allows us to provide sameday solutions for online orders we believe our integrated physical and virtual model when paired with our national and increasingly international scope represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to ecommerce as an independent sales channel one of our web solutions fastenal express guides our customers to products that are locally stocked capitalizing on our existing location footprint in order to provide sameday service for online orders this positions us to outperform what is more typically a 24 to 48 hour fulfillment expectation for mro and unplanned transactions we expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time 

we believe our current growth drivers – onsite locations international expansion national accounts industrial vending fmi and digital solutions – on a global basis represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed this is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and sticky service combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives as well as selling inmarket and otherwise and nonselling engineering product specialists manufacturing etc employees we offer a range of capabilities that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate 

we remain committed to a large robust service network including traditional branches it remains the indispensable foundation of our business in any given year it is difficult to predict whether our total branch count will rise or fall however with the growth we anticipate in onsite locations we believe our total inmarket locations will increase over time 

we believe the profitability of our inmarket locations is affected by the average revenue produced by each site in any inmarket location certain costs related to growth are at least partly variable such as employeerelated expenses while others like rent and utility costs tend to be fixed as a result it has been shown that as an inmarket location increases its sales base over time it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin this ability to increase our operating profit margin is influenced by 1 general growth based on end market expansion andor market share gains 2 the age of the inmarket location new locations tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and in the case of a traditional branch the time necessary to generate a customer base andor 3 rationalization actions as in the past several years we have seen a net decline in our traditional branch base there are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a location key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market factories may have closed our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches andor our customers may have transitioned to our onsite model the paths to higher operating profit margins are slightly different in a traditional branch versus an onsite location as the former will tend to have more fixed costs to leverage while the latter will tend to have a smaller fixed cost burden but have greater leverage of its employeerelated expenses in the short term the onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch even as its fixed expenses are largely unchanged 

we operate twelve regional distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina kansas and mississippi – and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these fifteen distribution centers give us approximately 45 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our inmarket locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier with approximately 87 of our north american inmarket locations receiving service four to five times per week the distribution center in indiana also serves as a master hub with those in california north carolina and kansas serving as secondary hubs to support the needs of the inmarket locations in their geographic regions as well as provide a broader selection of products for the inmarket locations serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california north carolina kansas and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems asrs these eleven distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 97 of our picking activity we expect to add andor expand new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our inmarket locations increases 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate digital distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized purchased and licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including growth through customer service ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business we have registered or applied for the registration of various trademarks and service marks our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the united states as long as they are in use their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use 

products 

fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies this includes threaded fasteners bolts nuts screws studs and related washers as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as pins machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories our fastener product line which is primarily sold under the fastenal product name represented 342 349 and 356 of our consolidated net sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

fastener distribution is complex in most cases the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight this presents challenges in moving product from suppliers most of whom are outside of north america to our distribution centers as well as from our distribution centers to our branch onsite and customer locations at the same time fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products construction projects and maintenance and repair while at the same time exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application in many cases a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime andor effective use these features have greatly influenced our logistical development training and educational programs support capabilities and inventory decisions which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate 

in 1993 we began to aggressively add additional product lines and these represented 658 651 and 644 of our consolidated sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively these products which we refer to as nonfastener product lines tend to move through the same distribution channel get used by the same customers and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line this logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering however over time the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line for instance nonfastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending 

the most significant category of nonfastener products is our safety supplies product line which accounted for 179 172 and 163 of our consolidated sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively this product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years nearly tripling as a percentage of sales over that tenyear time frame this is directly related to our success in industrial vending our tools product line accounts for approximately 10 of consolidated net sales representing 99 100 and 101 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

in the last several decades we have added private label brands often referred to as exclusive brands or brands sold exclusively through fastenal to our nonfastener offering these private label brands represented approximately 13 13 and 12 of our consolidated net sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we believe it is also appropriate to think about our private label sales as a percentage of our nonfastener sales for two reasons 1 branded vs private label dynamics of fasteners differ from those of nonfasteners and 2 nonfastener data is more comparable to information reported by our peers who do not generally have our significant mix of fastener business private label brands represented approximately 19 19 and 20 of our total nonfastener sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively over the last few years we have seen increases in sales of private label products as a percentage of total nonfastener sales when looking at specific sales channels such as onsite locations branches and vending however these increases were masked by the relative sales growth we are experiencing with onsite locations which typically have a lower percentage of total sales being private label than is the case in branches or sales through vending devices 

we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems by our sales personnel at inmarket locations by our district and regional leadership and by our product development team the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established 

minimummaximum level all branches stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and branch personnel nonbranch selling locations primarily onsites stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

inventory held at our selling locations close to customers and available on a sameday basis accounted for approximately 60 61 and 65 of our total inventory at the end of 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 40 39 and 35 of our total inventory at the end of 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the distribution center and manufacturing location inventory when combined with our trucking network allows for fast nextday service at a very competitive cost 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2019  approximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners and hardware made to customers specifications at one of our nine manufacturing locations or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  cardinal fasteners ®  and spensall ® product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to the repair of tools and hoists the fabrication of chain sling and hose band saw blade welding and other light manufacturing and fabrication we may add additional services in the future however we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect them to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales in the future 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2019  

in the case of fasteners and our private label nonfastener products we have a large number of suppliers but these suppliers are heavily concentrated in a single geographic area asia within asia suppliers in china represent a significant source of product as a result the cost and effectiveness of our supply chain is dependent on relatively unfettered trade across geographic regions 

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for our distribution equipment and our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades 

based on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing and nonresidential construction our business has historically been cyclical however we believe our model has certain protections that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes first we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing and nonresidential construction market although slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries locally or globally however we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions in addition while a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities this latter source of revenue tends to be directly influenced by cyclical changes but its rate of change tends to be less dramatic 

in an inmarket location our customers business activity is tracked through active accounts customers often have more than one active account at a single inmarket location reflecting their utilization of different fastenal services and frequently have active accounts at many inmarket locations across our global network during the fourth quarter of 2019  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity totaling at least 100 within the last 90 days was approximately 247000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts with purchase activity of at least 500 per month within the last 90 days was approximately 80000 in 2019  no one customer accounted for more than 5 of our sales 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local inmarket selling personnel as well as our nonbranch selling personnel we support our sales team with multichannel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing print and radio advertising catalogs promotional flyers events and branch signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on a nascar ® sponsorship through our partnership with roush fenway racing ® as the primary sponsor of the no 17 car in the monster energy ® nascar ® cup series 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales the first and fourth quarters are typically our lowest volume periods given their overlap with winter months in north america during which our direct and indirect sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather the fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the thanksgiving october in canada and november in the united states christmas and new year holiday periods due to plant shut downs in contrast the second and third quarters typically have higher revenues due to stronger nonresidential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays although good friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of july will always fall in the third quarter 

competition 

our business is highly competitive and includes large competitors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have branches we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products in no particular order are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

market strategies in industrial distribution are varied where products are concerned while many larger distributors have trended toward a broadline offering over time they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share this association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors though many smaller competitors do deploy a broadline model means of serving the customer are even more diverse for instance many competitors maintain a local branchbased presence in their markets while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales recent years have seen the emergence of ecommerce solutions such as websites and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors it also has introduced nontraditional webbased competitors into the marketplace the diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base the large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels from a single distributor or from a range of distributors to procure the products they need in their operations 

we believe that better service and a competitive selling advantage can be provided by maintaining a physical presence closer to the customers locations as a result we maintain branches in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products the convenience of a large number of branches in a given area combined with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending and bin stock solutions supported from an inmarket branch or onsite location provides a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each inmarket location also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local branch the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low investment given the existing branch and distribution structure 

employees 

at the end of 2019 we employed 21948 full and parttime employees of these approximately 72 held an inmarket or nonbranch selling role we characterize these personnel as follows 



note – in materials released on january 17 2019 related to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings results we undercounted our total employees by 25 we corrected this in the table above and throughout this document and as a result some of the figures will not match the comparable figures in our previously published fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings results 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to develop new markets and customer relationships we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to promote from within for example most new branch and onsite managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of inmarket locations are usually former branch managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program known as fsb develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific training and development programs that are offered to our employees the programs are offered through a combination of both classroom training and online learning fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective branch best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our selling personnel are compensated with a base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a branch onsite district regional and national account basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit inventory management and trade accounts receivable collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets improvement and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and costcontainment goals 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner could disrupt operations cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues and result in less efficient operations the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities still information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us it is also possible that we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our information systems our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data as well as the success of our growth drivers is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable or if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations it could adversely affect our profitability andor ability to grow 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event including any cyber security event but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely there can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our consolidated financial statements while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new branches in recent years however we have devoted increased resources to other growth drivers including our industrial vending business our onsite business our national accounts team and our international operations while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to additional sales growth failure to achieve any of our goals regarding industrial vending fmi onsite locations national accounts signings digital solutions international operations or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth further failure to identify appropriate targets for our onsite and industrial vending 

businesses or failure to find suitable locations for them once appropriate targets are identified may adversely impact our goals regarding the number of new onsite locations we are able to open or the number of industrial vending devices we are able to deploy 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products similarly in recent years revenues from national accounts customers which typically have lower gross profit margins by virtue of their scale and available business have tended to grow faster than revenues from smaller customers this factor has become more significant as revenues from onsite locations have grown in the mix customer and product mix have contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage over time including in 2019 and 2018 and will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in 2020 and beyond however whether this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are or are not offset by positive impacts to gross profit margin during such year downward pressure on sales prices changes in the volume of our orders and an inability to pass higher product costs on to customers could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances we may not be able to pass rising product costs to customers if those customers have ready product or supplier alternatives in the marketplace 

our operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings over time we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses including costs related to payroll occupancy freight and information technology among others as our net sales have grown however historically a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins there are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past for instance it is typical that when demand declines most commonly from cyclical factors though it could be due to customer losses or some other companyspecific event our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales it is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales in addition market variables such as labor rates energy costs and legal costs could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable us to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings should any of these scenarios or a combination of them occur in the future it is possible that our operating and pretax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue 

our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive and could result in failure to deploy devices we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local branch presence allowing us to service devices more rapidly our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending devices used in and certain software and services needed to operate our industrial vending business while these devices software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in us failing to meet our goals related to the number of devices we are able to deploy in the next twelve to eighteen months 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete our ability to generate additional sales and our profit margins our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the selling location level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including inside and outside branch associates onsite managers national account sales representatives and support personnel who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high particularly for less tenured employees if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer 

service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels 

our inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership in the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight andor leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles in addition difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team or recruiting suitable replacements could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations 

we may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or nontraditional competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although slowly consolidating still remains a large fragmented and highly competitive industry our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing technological and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources technological advancements and services increased competition from brickandmortar retailers could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending similarly the emergence of online retailers whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major nontraditional competitors could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods these pressures could have the effect of eroding our gross andor operating income profit andor percentage over time 

our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy and cyber security requirements regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results we are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties further our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected positively or negatively by changing tax priorities changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof the most significant recent example of this is the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which was enacted in the united states in december 2017 the tax act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate included a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings eliminated certain deductions for which we had previously qualified requires a current inclusion in us federal income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction in us taxable income for a portion of its foreignderived intangible income and introduced a base erosion antiabuse tax there is also a longer term risk that the beneficial aspects of the tax act on our business could be reversed depending on changes in future fiscal or political priorities 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

industry and general economic risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where we operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our inmarket locations sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those inmarket locations and other selling channels 

this risk was most recently demonstrated in 2019 after experiencing strong demand in 2017 and 2018 that produced doubledigit sales growth for fastenal our growth slowed into the midsingle digits beginning in the second quarter of 2019 during that period many of our customers involved in the manufacture of components capital goods and heavy equipment were impacted by higher costs and reduced confidence stemming from global trade uncertainty when this happens these customers tend to cut back on spending which yields a slowdown in our business with these customers 

trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly and could adversely impact our gross andor operating profit percentage we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of the united states primarily asia we have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from asia through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources this was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production but over time we have expanded our nonfastener sourcing as well and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term in light of this changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers andor impact the cost or price of our products with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results these risks are particularly acute currently in light of an increase in tariffs either directly on products we trade in or indirectly on industries we sell into between the united states and its trading partners as well as greater uncertainty around regional and global trade agreements generally china and canada represent significant sources of product and canada and mexico represent our two largest markets in terms of revenue generation after the united states and each of these countries are currently andor have been previously subject to disruption due to historical trade policies there can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business the degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies their timing and duration and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues in particular the tariffs levied on most of our products originating in china have caused us to review and implement potential solutions to the increase in our product costs with our customers the first of these actions occurred on september 24 2018 but since that date there have been additional actions to both increase the number of products covered by tariffs and to raise the tariff rates themselves we have taken actions including increasing product prices resourcing product and seeking exemptions for certain products that have been mostly effective at offsetting the impacts of tariffs on our financial results the effectiveness of these strategies in response to any future tariffs is unknown 

trade policies could have an adverse impact on industries we sell into negatively affecting our net sales and profits considerable political uncertainty in the united states may result in changes to trade policies that could create disruption in geographic demand trends to the extent that the united states government enacts tariffs or taxes that penalize imports to benefit domestic manufacturing we may improve our domestic sales which may have an overall positive impact on us given that 86 of our total revenue is derived from the united states however any such action may adversely impact our foreign sales which may in turn adversely impact our ability to expand our overseas branches in the future in addition should a foreign government engage in its own trade protection independent of or in response to another nations action it could have a negative direct or more likely indirect effect on our net sales and profits by reducing demand for exports by united states companies such changes could adversely affect our financial results 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available for reasons unrelated to trade policy which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments or changes in local economic conditions additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial or other difficulties our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing equally appealing products and services 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs can fluctuate significantly over time increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and branch operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass higher supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit to decline or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions in august and september 2017 we experienced temporary disruptions in our distribution network in our gulf coast florida georgia and puerto rico regions due to hurricanes harvey irma and maria these storms adversely impacted our product demand and revenues as well as our gross and operating profit percentages due to an increase in demand for stormrelated products which have a lower gross profit margin and inefficiencies in delivery services in the immediate aftermath of the storms in september 2018 hurricane florence had a similar impact in our carolinas region and in the first quarter of 2019 severe winter weather had a similar impact across the northern part of the united states 

our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that north american market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed 140 billion this figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreedupon demand and market share statistics instead we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources if we have overestimated the size of our market and in doing so underestimated our current share of it the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe similarly we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies such as industrial vending and onsite locations we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 17 million devices and we have identified over 15000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model similar to the case for total market size we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the 

marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure if we decide to do so in the future we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results as of december 31 2019  we had 3450 of outstanding debt obligations including loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility of 2100 and senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement in the aggregate principal amount of 1350  loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on november 30 2023 the notes issued under our master note agreement consist of three series the first is in an aggregate principal amount of 400 bears interest at a fixed rate of 200 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2021 the second is in an aggregate principal amount of 350 bears interest at a fixed rate of 245 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2022 the third is in an aggregate principal amount of 600 bears interest at a fixed rate of 322 per annum and is due and payable on march 1 2024 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the credit facility is 7000 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the master note agreement is 6000 however none of the institutional investors that are parties to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the credit market turmoil of 2008 and 2009 did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased our indebtedness has increased since 2009 and we have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return the cost of servicing our existing debt could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high 

investment risk 

there can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time stock prices including ours are commonly thought to be a function of earnings multiplied by a multiple historically investors have given our earnings a higher multiple or premium than is typical of the broader industrial sector of which we are typically associated we believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth profitability and returns however to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies andor poorly navigate the risks that surround our business including those described throughout this section or to the extent our industry industrial distribution or industrial stocks in general loses favor in the marketplace there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2018 2017 and prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of over 3200 inmarket locations most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration companies oil production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our branches onsite locations and customers are primarily located in north america 

it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big we estimate the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america and no company has a significant portion of this market 2 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive but the cost and time to manage procure and transport these products can be quite meaningful 3 purchasing professionals often expend disproportionate effort managing the high sku count of lowvolume low value mro supplies which is better allocated to their higher volume higher value oem supplies 4 many customers prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business while also utilizing various technologies and models including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly to improve availability and reduce waste 5 we believe the markets are efficient to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customer 

our approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto growth through customer service  the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind our customerfacing resources to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we strive to generate strong profits which produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers lastly we identify drivers that allow us to get closer to our customers and gain market share 

we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can serve our customers at the closest economic point of contact at one point the closest economic point of contact was the local branch today in some cases we have moved the branch inside the customers facility we also are frequently positioned right at the point of consumption within customers facilities through our industrial vending or fmi capabilities therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles by doing these things every day fastenal remains a growthcentric organization 

executive overview 

net sales increas ed 3686 or 74 in 2019 relative to 2018 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to 472 in 2019 from 483 in 2018 our operating income as a percentage of net sales declined to 198 in 2019 from 201 in 2018 

our net earnings in 2019 were 7909 an increase of 52 when compared to 2018 our diluted net earnings per share were 138 in 2019 compared to 131 in 2018 an increase of 52 discrete tax items benefited net earnings by 71 in 2018 

we continued to focus on our growth drivers in 2019 daily sales to our n ational account customers defined as customer accounts with a multisite contract grew 119 in the period additionally we signed 362 new onsite customer locations defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within or in close proximity to the customers facility and 21857 new industria l vending devices we experienced sales growth in the midteens through both our vending devices and our onsite locations excluding sales transferred from a branch 

the table below summarizes our total employee headcount our investments in inmarket locations defined as the sum of the total number of public branch locations and the total number of active onsite locations and industrial vending devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period 



1 this number primarily represents devices which principally dispense product and produce product revenues and excludes approximately 15000 devices that are part of a locker lease program where the devices are principally used for the checkincheckout of equipment 

during the last twelve months we reduced our absolute employee headcount by 38 people in our inmarket locations and increased by 304 people in total the reduction in our absolute employee headcount in our inmarket locations reflects actions taken by leadership in our public branches over the past couple of quarters to control expenses in response to weaker demand which was only partly offset by increases to support growth in our number of onsite locations the increase in our total absolute employee headcount is mostly from additions we have made to support customer acquisition implementation and growth in the field particularly as it relates to our growth drivers and to support general corporate and hub functions 

we opened twelve branches and closed 125 branches net of conversions in 2019 we activated 312 onsite locations and closed 92 net of conversions in 2019 the number of closings reflects both normal churn in our business whether due to exiting customer relationships the shutting or relocation of a customer facility or a customer decision as well as a review of certain underperforming locations our inmarket network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open or close locations as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network support our growth drivers and manage our operating expenses 

results of operations 

the following sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information as a percentage of net sales for the periods ended december 31 



net sales 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period the table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended december 31 and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period 

the increases in net sales noted above for both 2019 and 2018 were a result of higher unit sales and to a lesser degree higher prices higher product prices were realized throughout 2019 and 2018 as a result of actions beginning initially in late 2017 taken to offset increases in product costs and we believe these increases contributed 09 to 10 and 07 to 08 to sales growth during 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in net sales for 2017 was driven primarily by higher unit sales price increases were not a material factor in 2017 

the higher unit sales in 2019 and 2018 resulted primarily from two sources the first is higher underlying market demand which we believe is reflected in a number of metrics for instance the us purchasing managers index published by the institute for supply chain management averaged 512 in 2019 and 588 in 2018 readings above 50 are indicative of growing demand and we believe these levels are consistent with the sales growth rates we experienced in the respective periods in addition us industrial production which is published by the federal reserve increased 08 in 2019 and increased 39 in 2018 we believe us industrial production is a good proxy for the state of our marketplace and that the growth in this metric is consistent with the sales growth rates we experienced in the respective periods this was reflected as well in daily sales of fasteners our most cyclical product line which grew 55 and 112 in 2019 and 2018 respectively we also experienced growth in sales to 75 of our top 100 customers in 2019 which compares to growth in sales to 84 of our top 100 customers in 2018 

another explanation for our results is that while underlying demand throughout 2018 was stable at high levels underlying demand in 2019 began strong but weakened throughout the year for instance the us purchasing managers index averaged 554 in the first quarter of 2019 but averaged 479 in the fourth quarter of 2019 in addition us industrial production increased 29 in the first quarter of 2019 but decreased 09 in the fourth quarter of 2019 the slowing in these metrics from the start to the end of 2019 mirrors the slowing growth we experienced in our unit sales over the same period 

a relatively greater contributor to our growth in 2019 was the success of our growth initiatives we signed 21857 industrial vending devices during 2019 while this represented a slight decrease in signings of 10 from 2018 it also contributed to growth in our installed base to 89937 vending devices at the end of 2019 an increase of 108 over 2018 growth in our installed base was primarily responsible for sales growth through our vending devices in the midteens during 2019 we signed 362 new onsite locations in 2019 an increase of 77 over 2018 and had 1114 active sites on december 31 2019 an increase of 246 over december 31 2018 growth in our number of active sites was primarily responsible for sales growth through our onsites in the midteens during 2019 the contribution of new national account contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 119 in 2019 compared to 2018 

we signed 22073 industrial vending devices during 2018 an increase of 140 over 2017 in addition to an increase in our installed base we achieved a lowsingle digit increase in average sales per device these variables combined to generate sales growth through our vending devices in excess of 20 in 2018 we signed 336 new onsite locations in 2018 an increase of 244 over 2017 and had 894 active sites on december 31 2018 an increase of 478 over december 31 2017 we signed 152 new national account contracts in 2018 the contribution of these new contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 181 in 2018 compared to 2017 

we signed 19355 industrial vending devices during 2017 an increase of 72 over 2016 in addition to an increase in our 

installed base we were also more efficient with the existing base resulting in a modest increase in average sales per device and 

a decrease in our device removals of 38 combined sales through our vending devices accelerated throughout 2017 finishing 

with growth in the high teens we signed 270 new onsite locations in 2017 an increase of 534 over 2016 and had 605 active 

sites on december 31 2017 an increase of 509 over december 31 2016 we signed 168 new national account contracts in 

2017 the contribution of these new contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily 

sales from our national account customers growing 145 in 2017 compared to 2016 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from fasteners safety supplies and all other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales arises from two factors first we believe nonfastener products represent a larger market opportunity than fasteners and that we are relatively underrepresented in this market over time this has led to faster growth in the nonfastener product lines a trend amplified by the growth of our industrial vending program through which we sell primarily nonfastener products we believe this factor impacted each year shown and will continue to promote a lower mix of fasteners in our total sales over time second a weak industrial production environment has a disproportionately negative effect on fastener sales particularly oem fasteners sales relative to nonfastener sales which relates more to plant operations than production this weakness is more of a cyclical factor than a structural one and as such was relevant in 2019 but not in 2018 or 2017 when a better economic environment at least partially mitigated the first factor discussed 

annual sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

annual sales changes by month 

during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days andor seasons impact certain end markets particularly nonresidential construction the first landing centers on easter and the good friday holiday that precedes it which alternates between march and april good friday occurred in april 2019 march 2018 and april 2017 and will fall in april in 2020 the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our nonresidential construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average 20142018 we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2019 2018 and 2017 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 19delta 18delta and 17delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 

it is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages in a year where demand is strong our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it in a year where demand is weak we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it in both cases there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform 



1 the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – we estimate approximately 65 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market the daily sales growth rates to these manufacturing customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  



1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line approximately 35 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



the daily sales growth rates of fasteners noted in the table above for first quarter of 2018 and the second third and fourth quarters of 2017 include 37 36 38 and 39 percentage points respectively attributable to mansco acquired on march 31 2017 

by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all end markets 



while not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment as was experienced in the latter half of 2019 our nonfastener business did demonstrate greater relative resilience when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general nonfastener growth slowed but remained above the growth of the fastener business the strong relative performance of the nonfastener business when compared to the fastener business and to the distribution industry in general was also evident during the strong 2018 and 2017 periods we believe this is due to both the growth of our vending business and our lower penetration of the nonfastener marketplace relative to our penetration of the fastener marketplace 

our nonresidential construction and reseller customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  

1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our nonresidential construction and reseller business is heavily influenced by the manufacturing economy as well as infrastructure spending in 2019 the slowing production environment as described above and the accompanying worsening trends for commodities caused the growth in our nonresidential construction and reseller customers to slow in 2018 and 2017 improving trends for commodities such as metals and energy industrial capital spending and the state of the broader economy contributed to an improvement in growth for these end markets 

gross profit 

the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 472 in 2019 and 483 in 2018 the gross profit percentage for 2019 declined by 110 basis points based on three items 1 a change in product and customer mix fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers our fastener product line declined to 342 of sales in 2019 from 349 of sales in 2018 larger customers for which national accounts are a good proxy whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing also influence the gross profit margin sales to our national account customers increased to 536 in 2019 from 507 of sales in 2018 the combination of relatively slower growth in our fastener product line and relatively faster growth in sales to our largest customers contributed to the decline in our overall gross profit margin in 2019 2 we operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers our distribution centers and our inmarket locations we believe this provides us a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to move product efficiently and quickly there is a cost to supporting and maintaining these assets which we traditionally attempt to minimize by charging freight during periods of weaker business conditions it can be more difficult to charge freight and as a result our freight revenues were down in 2019 at the same time the overall cost of our fleet assets is relatively stable resulting in reduced absorption of our fixed costs 3 we experienced an increase in the cost of our products due to generalized inflation and tariffs resulting from disputes between the united states and its trade partners we implemented several actions to mitigate the impact of these cost increases in 2019 including price increases for the full year the net impact of these actions was minor however the impact through the year differed with a larger negative impact on the gross profit percentage in the first half of 2019 and a relatively modest impact in the second half of 2019 

during 2018 and 2017 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the prior year in each year the decrease was primarily caused by the changes in product and customer mix noted above and rising freight expense as a result of costs related to transporting products particularly shipping fees driver wages and fuel in 2018 our gross profit percentage was also affected by rising product costs as a result of generalized inflation and tariffs in 2017 our gross profit percentage was also affected by the acquisition of mansco the customer mix of which is more heavily oriented toward larger customers and its product mix tends to carry a lower gross profit product mix than the companys other products 

operating and administrative expenses 

our operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment as a percentage of net sales improved to 273 in 2019 from 282 in 2018 this improvement was a function of the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses being more modest than the growth in sales employeerelated expenses reduced the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 40 to 45 basis points in 2019 from 2018 occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses each reduced the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 20 to 25 basis points each in 2019 from 2018 

the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment compared to the same periods in the preceding year is outlined in the table below 

employeerelated expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes our employeerelated expenses increased in 2019 this was related to 1 an increase in fulltime equivalent fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution and options awards 4 increases in hourly base wages and 5 increased health care costs the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was related to 1 an increase in fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution 4 increases in hourly base wages and 5 increased health care costs the increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was related to 1 an increase in fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings as well as regulatory driven incremental compensation 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution and options awards 4 increased health care costs and 5 the inclusion of mansco personnel 

the table below summarizes the percentage change in our fte headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period 



occupancyrelated expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our branches and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our inmarket operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expense the increase in occupancyrelated expenses in 2019 when compared to 2018 was mainly driven by increases related to industrial vending equipment the increase in occupancyrelated expenses in 2018 when compared to 2017 was mainly driven by increases related to industrial vending equipment and nonbranch occupancy and utility costs only partly offset by a slight decline in branch occupancy costs from a lower public branch count the slight increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was mainly driven by increases in costs related to industrial vending equipment fmi bins and automation equipment at our distribution centers the most significant components of our occupancyrelated expenses facility costs and utility expenses were mostly flat in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to a reduction in our number of public branches 

all other operating and administrative expenses include 1 sellingrelated transportation 2 information technology it expenses 3 general corporate expenses which consists of legal expenses general insurance expenses travel and marketing expenses etc and 4 the gain on sales of property and equipment combined all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2019 when compared to 2018 this was primarily due to higher it spending the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was due to an increase in sellingrelated transportation expenses consisting of both higher vehicle movement and fuel costs as well as higher it spending general corporate expenses were slightly down the increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was driven by increases in sellingrelated transportation including higher vehicle movement and fuel costs it spending and general corporate expenses 

net interest expense 

our net interest expense was 136 in 2019 compared to 123 in 2018 and 87 in 2017 the increase in 2019 when compared to 2018 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance during the period the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance during the period 

income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 2528 in 2019 or 242 of earnings before income taxes our income tax expense was reduced by 26 as a result of applying guideline clarifications issued by the irs on certain aspects of tax reform as well as tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options this reduced our tax rate in the period by 30 basis points 

we recorded income tax expense of 2351 in 2018 or 238 of earnings before income taxes the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the following two items 1 the lower corporate tax rate provided by the tax act resulted in a 

lower tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the effective income tax rate includes the immaterial impact of the us tax on certain offshore earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income gilti a new deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii and the new alternative us tax on certain base erosion antiavoidance beat payments from a us company to any foreign related party 2 discrete income tax items to adjust our transition tax liability reflect the impacts of accelerating depreciation for certain physical assets and remeasure the impact of the us tax rate on certain intercompany transactions these discrete items resulted in approximately 71 of income tax benefit during 2018 the accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act is complete as of december 31 2018 

we recorded a provisional income tax expense of 2945 in 2017 or 337 of earnings before income taxes this amount reflects a provisional estimate for the reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of 308 as a result of the income tax rate decrease included in the tax act partially offset by an estimated increase in income tax payable in the amount of 65 as a result of the transition tax on cash and cash equivalent balances related to accumulated earnings associated with our international operations also included in the tax act the decrease in our income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was also related to changes in our reserve for uncertain tax positions and the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 

net earnings 

net earnings net earnings per share eps the percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



1 as a result of the tax act discrete tax items benefited our net earnings by 71 during 2018 

during 2019 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits and were only partly offset by an increase in income tax expense during 2018 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits combined with a reduction in income tax expense the increase in basic and diluted earnings per share also reflected the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2018 during 2017 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits combined with a reduction in income tax expense the slightly higher increase in basic and diluted earnings per share was primarily due to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2019 the increase in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings reflects a reduced drag from working capital investment than was experienced in 2018 and to a lesser degree higher net income in 2018 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net earnings growth which resulted from pretax earnings growth and a lower tax rate as a result of the tax act the decline in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings largely reflects working capital trends as further described below in 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net earnings growth 

operational working capital assets 

operational working capital assets which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories is highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

in 2019 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects not only our growth in sales but also the fact that our growth is being driven disproportionately by our national accounts program where our customers tend to have longer payment terms than our customer base as a whole growth was also relatively stronger with customers outside the us which similarly tend to have longer payment terms than our customer base as a whole the rate of growth in receivables did slow throughout 2019 largely reflecting the impact on receivables of softer business activity in 2018 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects accelerating growth in sales throughout the course of the year combined with relatively stronger growth of our national accounts and international business in addition two trends emerged among our customer base that increased our net accounts receivable the first was a push from our customers to contractually increase the period between when they are invoiced and when payment is due the second was customers delaying payments beyond the end of the applicable quarter we saw these behaviors intensify throughout 2018 

our inventory balances over time will respond to business activity though various factors produce a looser relationship to our monthly sales patterns than we tend to experience in accounts receivable one reason for this is cyclical we source significant quantities of product from overseas and the lead time involved in procuring these products is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns as a result trends in our inventory will often lag trends in economic conditions another reason inventories may fluctuate independently of monthly sales patterns is based on strategic decisions for instance at various times we have increased our relative inventory levels to enhance product breadth and availability in our branches and distribution centers expand direct sourcing and broaden fastenal brands our growth drivers including industrial vending solutions national accounts and onsite and international locations have also required significant investments in inventory in 2019 our inventories increased to support higher sales largely reflecting large increases in the number of installed vending devices and active onsite locations and from inflation and tariffs we intend to continue to invest in the inventory necessary to support our vending and onsite initiatives however over the course of the year we did reduce other spending both reflecting proactive efforts to reduce inventory and in reaction to the effect of softer business activity which allowed us to meaningfully decelerate inventory growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 in 2018 our inventories increased as a result of growth in general demand and successful execution of our growth drivers inflation had an increasing impact in the second half of 2018 and our decision to accelerate shipments of product to the us from overseas ahead of potential tariffs resulted in extra inventory of approximately 120 in the fourth quarter of 2018 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities were primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below for each period and cash paid for acquisitions in 2017 

property and equipment expenditures typically consist primarily of 1 purchases related to industrial vending 2 purchases of property and equipment related to expansion of and enhancements to distribution centers 3 spending on software and hardware for our information processing systems 4 the addition of fleet vehicles 5 expansion improvement or investment in certain owned or leased branch properties and 6 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business 

set forth below is a recap of our 2019  2018  and 2017 net capital expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and net earnings 



our net capital expenditures increased in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to increased spending on hub property and equipment both to expand current capacity and for potential future expansion higher spending on vending devices to support the growth of our industrial vending program and investment in our trucking assets while the sources of the increase in our net capital spending in 2019 were expected our total spend exceeded our targeted range of 1950 to 2250 we had significant spending in 2019 on facilities with a couple of locations having higher costs than originally anticipated our net capital expenditures increased in 2018 when compared to 2017 primarily due to increased spending on hub property and equipment both to expand current capacity and for potential future expansion as well as vending devices to support the growth of our industrial vending program our net capital expenditures decreased in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to lower spending in 2017 related to the absence of spending on vending equipment that occurred in 2016 related to the leased locker rollout the absence of spending on shelving and signage that occurred in 2016 for the csp 16 initiative and timing associated with the addition of pickup trucks 

we expect our net capital expenditures in 2020 to be within a range of 1800 to 2050 this decrease from 2019 is primarily attributable to reduced projects to develop and expand certain distribution center assets and to a lesser degree reduced fleet vehicle investment we anticipate funding our capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net payments proceeds from debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases 

in 2019 we did not purchase any shares of our common stock in 2018 we purchased 4000000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 2575 per share and in 2017 we purchased 3800000 shares at an average price of approximately 2172 per share 

dividends 

we declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per share on january 16 2020  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 087   077  and  064 in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

debt 

in order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business to expand capacity and increase the use of automation in our distribution centers pay dividends and to purchase our common stock in 2018 we have borrowed under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility peaked during each quarter of 2019 and 2018 as follows 



as of december 31 2019 we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 2100 and contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 363  as of december 31 2019  we also had loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 1350  descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings 

approximately 1227 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the tax act the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation 

we experienced higher product costs through 2019 relative to 2018 as a result of generalized inflation and tariffs though the impact of these items did moderate later in the year as economic activity slowed and conditions around trade stabilized we took actions during the year to mitigate the effects of higher product costs including increasing product prices these actions were not able to offset the pressure we experienced on our gross profit percentage in the first half of 2019 but were more effective at doing so in the second half of 2019 throughout 2018 we experienced increasing product cost inflation for nonfastener and especially fastener products we took actions in the latter part of 2017 and throughout 2018 including pricing adjustments to offset this inflation while we succeeded in raising prices through the year we were not able to do so at the same rate that our costs rose which negatively affected our profit margins and earnings in 2018 apart from generalized inflation tariffs were instituted on certain products that we source from china but this occurred later in the year and did not have a meaningful impact on sales or profits in 2018 throughout 2017 we experienced increasing product cost inflation particularly in our fastener products we were able to take actions during the period including pricing adjustments to mostly offset this inflation in the aggregate the overall impact of inflation and pricing on sales and profits was not material in 2017 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances historical experience and actuarial valuations actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

our most significant accounting policies including revenue recognition and inventories are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations our most critical accounting estimates include the following 

allowance for doubtful accounts – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs our methodology for estimating this reserve includes ongoing reviews of the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

inventory obsolescence reserves – these reserves are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels sales information and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product our methodology for estimating these reserves is continually evaluated for factors that could require changes to the reserves including significant changes in product demand market conditions condition of the inventory or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

general insurance reserves – these reserves are for general claims related to workers compensation property and casualty losses and other general liability selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends we perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels we analyze historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

new accounting pronouncements 

a description of new accounting pronouncements is contained in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic area is contained in note 2 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form 10k under the heading forwardlooking statements and item 1a risk factors 

certain contractual obligations 

as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding longterm debt and facilities equipment and vehicles leased under operating leases our future obligations to pay principal of and interest on such longterm debt and to make minimum lease payments under such operating leases are as follows 



1 interest on the longterm debt outstanding under our credit facility was calculated using the interest rates and balances at december 31 2019 

2 amounts include lease liabilities for pickup truck leases which typically have a noncancelable lease term of less than one year and are not included on the consolidated balance sheets as an operating lease rightofuse asset 

purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above our purchase orders are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities 

liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these liabilities which we believe will be immaterial a discussion of income taxes is contained in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments our operations in countries other than the us and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material in 2019 changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced our reported net sales by 148 with the estimated effect on our net earnings being immaterial 

commodity steel pricing – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners and related hardware we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers during 2019 the price of commodity steel as reflected in many market indexes has declined during 2018 we experienced inflation in the cost of steel products during 2017 we experienced some inflation in the cost of steel products 

commodity energy prices – we have market risk for changes in prices of oil gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity prices for gasoline and diesel were mostly stable over the course of 2019 resulting in our fuel costs being similarly stable during the period this carried over from the latter part of 2018 when the costs of these commodities began to ease however through most of 2018 the prices of these commodities increased resulting in higher fuel costs for our hub and fieldbased vehicles and utility costs for our inmarket locations distribution centers and manufacturing facilities in the period fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell as a result rising costs for these commodities resulted in higher costs for many of these products we believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers the efficiency of our trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency in 2019 our estimated net earnings exposure for commodity energy prices was immaterial 

interest rates  loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates tied to libor or if libor is no longer available at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the credit facility and consented to by us as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a one percentage point increase in libor in 2019 would have resulted in approximately 32 of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first branch in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 27000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies spanning more than nine major product lines described later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2018 we had 3121  inmarket locations defined in the table below in 26 countries supported by 14 distribution centers in north america 11 in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and we employed 21644  people we believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year as well as the number of public branches onsite locations and total inmarket locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



1 onsite location information prior to 2014 is intentionally omitted while such locations have existed since 1992 we did not specifically track their number until we identified our onsite program as a growth driver in 2014 

2 inmarket locations is defined as the sum of the total number of public branches and the total number of onsite locations 

one of fastenals guiding principles since inception is that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer through much of our history this was achieved by opening branches and today we believe there are few companies that offer our north american branch coverage in 2018 roughly 54 of our sales and 52 of our branches were in major metropolitan statistical areas msas populations greater than 500000 people while 19 of our sales and 16 of our branches were in small msas populations under 500000 people and 27 of our sales and 32 of our branches were not in a msa in our view this has proved to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis these branches have represented and continue to represent the foundation of our service approach however we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our branch network and in recent years we have developed additional models that get us still closer to the customer including vending bin stocks and onsite locations 

we currently have several versions of selling locations 1 a traditional or public branch services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of products we offer 2 an overseas branch focuses on manufacturing customers and our fastener product line and is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada 3 a strategic account branch is a unique location that sells to multiple large accounts in a market 4 a strategic account site is similar to a strategic account branch but typically operates out of an existing branch rather than from a unique location and 5 an onsite location provides dedicated sales and service from within or in close proximity to the customers facility 

traditional overseas and strategic account branches sell to multiple customers and together comprise our total branch count our strategic account sites are considered an extension of the branch from which it operates and are not included separately in our total branch counts onsite locations which serve a single customer are similarly not included in our total branch counts however outside of the fact that they serve a single customer we believe the function and operation of an onsite location is similar to that of a branch this model also represents a meaningful portion of the companys total revenue and we expect that share to grow materially over time as a result we refer to our network in terms of inmarket locations which includes our total branches and onsite locations and we refer to strategic account sites as noninmarket locations 

branch locations  are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction companies we stock all branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and over time where appropriate our district and branch personnel may tailor the inventory 

offering to the needs of the local customer base since fastenals founding and through 2013 branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company and we experienced net openings each year over that time span we have long maintained that marketplace demographics could support a north american network of 3500 traditional branches however since establishing this figure new growth drivers and business models onsite vending digital solutions have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth it is now unlikely that we will operate the total traditional branch locations we previously believed would be the potential of north america we will continue to open traditional branches as the company sees fit however in each year since 2013 the company has experienced a net decline in its total branch count including net declines of 156 branches in 2018 120 branches in 2017 and 119 branches in 2016 

we first went international when we opened a branch in canada in 1994 since then we have continued to expand our global footprint and at the end of 2018 we operated in 25 countries outside of the united states canada and mexico are the largest of these representing approximately 11 of total sales collectively and we also operate in europe asia southeast asia and central and south america this remaining international business is approximately 3 of total sales our gotomarket strategy in countries outside of north america focuses primarily on servicing large national account customers from a product perspective these customers are more heavily oriented toward planned fastener spend though in recent years the international business has been growing faster than the us business we are not as well recognized in many of our foreign locations as we are in the us and to a lesser extent canada however our ability to provide a consistent service model including vending bin stocks and onsites on a global basis is attractive to our foreign customer base much of which are the foreign operations of usbased companies our international subsidiaries now have over 450 inmarket locations including over 150 onsite locations have over 9600 vending devices installed and employ over 3300 people from around the world 

the following table provides a summary of the traditional overseas and strategic account branch locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the openings closings and conversions during each year

6  converted locations are sites converted from traditional branches to onsite locations or noninmarket locations net of sites converted from noninmarket locations or onsite locations to traditional branches 

onsite   locations  may influence the trend in total branch count over time the onsite concept is not new in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992 however we identified it as a growth driver in 2014 and have made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace since 2015 in this model we service a customer from a location that is physically within the customers facility or in some cases at a strategically placed offsite location with inventory that is specific to the customers needs in many cases we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch the model is best suited to larger companies though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors it has been our experience that gross profit percentages at onsite locations tend to be lower than at branches but we gain significant revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is materially lower we have identified over 15000 customer locations with potential to implement the onsite service model these include customers with which we have 

an existing national account relationship today as well as potential customers we are aware of due to our local market presence we expect revenues from onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time we experienced net increases of 289 204 and 137 onsite locations in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we had 894 onsite locations as of december 31 2018 and anticipate signing 375 to 400 new onsite locations in 2019 

the following table provides a summary of the new onsite customer locations signed and the total onsite locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the onsite openings and closings during each year 

in 1995 we developed a national accounts  program aimed at making our products and services more competitive with customers that operate multiple facilities these customers tend to have more complex supply chains and structures for managing the original equipment manufacturing oem and maintenance repair and operations mro products we provide while at the same time by virtue of their size and opportunity have more negotiating power we believe our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint our ability to provide a consistent level of hightouch service and broad product availability and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing quality control and product knowledge are attractive to these larger customers we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels such as industrial vending onsite fastenal managed inventory fmi ®  digital solutions and resources to serve these customers unique demands as a result in 2018 national accounts represented 512 of our net sales compared to 487 and 474 in 2017 and 2016 respectively we believe we will continue to perform well with these customers 

we introduced industrial vending  in 2008 vending provides our customers the benefits of reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and we believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive inmarket network for these reasons the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and we finished 2018 with over 96000 devices in the field 81000 generating product revenue and 15000 in a locker lease program our discussion generally focuses on the 81000 product revenue devices we believe vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support we estimate the market could support as many as 17 million industrial vending devices and as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time we anticipate signing 23000 to 25000 new devices in 2019 

our industrial vending portfolio consists of 23 different vending devices with 15 of these being in either a helix or locker format our most utilized models include the helixbased fast 5000 which is approximately 40 of our installed base of devices and our 12 and 18door lockers which combined are approximately 35 of our installed base of devices the lockers are available in multiple configurations and the helix format is configurable to accommodate the various sizes and forms of products that will be dispensed to match the unique needs of our customer target monthly revenues per device typically range from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 depending on the type of device and products dispensed the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of device and 2 machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as 0375 machine equivalent 0375  7502000 

the industrial vending product revenue devices information related to contracts signed during each period was as follows 



the industrial vending product revenue devices information related to installed devices at the end of each period was as follows 



in addition to industrial vending noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide fastenal managed inventory fmi  programs also known as keep fill or bin stock programs in the industry to numerous customers this business relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners fmi is like our industrial vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities however the device is typically an open bin which is clustered with other bins in a racking system each of which holds oem fasteners mro fasteners andor nonfastener products that are consumed in the customers operations these bins utilize a variety of technologies for instance some bins are set up with the latest scanning technologies to determine when product is at a minimum desired level and requires refill while others utilize scales to measure the volume of a bins content by its weight we believe our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers fmi programs tend to generate a higher frequency of business transactions and coupled with our fully integrated distribution network that allows us to manage these programs for all sizes of customers foster a strong relationship with customers as we are often their preferred supplier 

we also invest in digital solutions  that aim to deliver strategic value for our customers leverage local inventory for sameday solutions and provide efficient service these solutions take many forms for instance the above noted technologies vending and fmi provide locational data that we can utilize to provide strategic value to our customers an example of this is fast 360 which surfaces data around our managed services providing our customers with one central source of information as we manage their oem and mro products we also provide eprocurement solutions electronic data interface or edi and punchouts these provide systemtosystem exchange of documents such as purchase orders advance shipping notices and invoices for direct and indirect spend through a direct integration into our customers enterprise resource planning erp systems or through a third party procurement network or marketplace this creates an efficient accurate and streamlined procuretopay process we also have an ecommerce offering that allows us to provide sameday solutions for online orders we believe our integrated physical and virtual model when paired with our national and increasingly international scope represents a unique capability in industrial distribution when compared to ecommerce as an independent sales channel one of our web solutions fastenal express guides our customers to products that are locally stocked capitalizing on our existing location footprint in order to provide sameday service for online orders this positions us to outperform what is more typically a 24 to 48 hour fulfillment expectation for mro and unplanned transactions we expect to continue to build out and develop our digital solutions over time 

we believe our current growth drivers – onsite locations national accounts industrial vending fmi and digital solutions – represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed this is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and sticky service combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives such as our customer service project csp initiatives which expand inventory placement at our branches to enhance sameday capabilities as well 

as selling inmarket and otherwise and nonselling engineering product specialists manufacturing etc employees we offer a range of capabilities that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate 

we remain committed to a large robust service network including traditional branches it remains the indispensable foundation of our business in any given year it is difficult to predict whether our total branch count will rise or fall however with the growth we anticipate in onsite locations we believe our total inmarket locations will increase over time 

it has been our experience that our profitability is affected by the average revenue produced by each branch while certain costs related to growth at a branch are at least partly variable such as employeerelated expenses others like rent and utility costs tend to be fixed as a result it has been shown that as a branch increases its sales base over time it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin this ability to increase our average revenue per branch is influenced by 1 general growth based on end market expansion andor market share gains 2 the age of the branch base new branches tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base however when these new branches mature and increase their sales base their profitability similarly increases and 3 rationalization actions – in the past several years the company has seen a net decline in its branch base there are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a branch key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market or transitioned to our onsite model factories may have closed or our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches in the short term the onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch 

we operate 11 regional distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas – and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us approximately 39 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our inmarket locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier with approximately 84 of our north american inmarket locations receiving service four to five times per week the distribution center in indiana also serves as a master hub with those in california north carolina and kansas serving as secondary hubs to support the needs of the inmarket locations in their geographic regions as well as provide a broader selection of products for the inmarket locations serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia california north carolina kansas and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems asrs these ten distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 94 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated construction of a new distribution center in washington which will include asrs technology began in 2018 and we expect this project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 construction of a new distribution center in mississippi also began in 2018 and we expect this project to be completed in the third quarter of 2019 we would expect to add andor expand new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our inmarket locations increases 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate digital distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized purchased and licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including growth through customer service ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies this includes threaded fasteners which represent approximately 84 of total fastener sales and includes bolts nuts screws studs and related washers as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as pins machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories our fastener product line which is primarily sold under the fastenal product name represented 349 356 and 366 of our consolidated net sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively of this threaded fasteners represented approximately 29 30 and 33 of our consolidated net sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

fastener distribution is complex in most cases the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight this presents challenges in moving product from suppliers most of whom are outside of north america to our distribution centers as well 

as from our distribution centers to our branch onsite and customer locations at the same time fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products construction projects and maintenance and repair while at the same time exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application in many cases a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime andor effective use these features have greatly influenced our logistical development training and educational programs support capabilities and inventory decisions which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate 

in 1993 we began to aggressively add additional product lines and these represented 651 644 and 634 of our consolidated sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively these products which we refer to as nonfastener product lines tend to move through the same distribution channel get used by the same customers and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line this logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering however over time the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line for instance nonfastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending 

the most significant category of nonfastener products is our safety supplies product line which accounted for 172 163 and 160 of our consolidated sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively this product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years nearly tripling as a percentage of sales over that tenyear time frame this is directly related to our success in industrial vending our tools product line now accounts for 10 of consolidated net sales representing 100 101 and 99 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively also in the last several years we added private label brands often referred to as fastenal brands to our offering and these represented approximately 13 12 and 12 of our consolidated net sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems by our sales personnel at inmarket locations by our district and regional leadership and by our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all branches stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and branch personnel nonbranch selling locations primarily onsites stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

inventory held at our selling locations close to customers and available on a sameday basis accounted for approximately 61 65 and 64 of our total inventory at the end of 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 39 35 and 36 of our total inventory at the end of 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the distribution center and manufacturing location inventory when combined with our trucking network allows for fast nextday service at a very competitive cost 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2018  approximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  and cardinal fasteners ®  product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to the repair of tools and hoists the fabrication of chain sling and hose band saw blade welding and other light manufacturing and fabrication we may add additional services in the future however we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect them to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales in the future 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2018  

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for distribution equipment two main suppliers for our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades 

during the fourth quarter of 2018  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity totaling at least 100 within the last 90 days was approximately 256000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts with purchase activity of at least 500 per month within the last 90 days was approximately 80000 in 2018 we changed our definitions of active customer accounts and core accounts and the figures below are the comparable figures in 2017 which reflects those changes in 2017 an active account was defined as having spend in the preceding 90 days of 1 versus the new 100 while core accounts was defined as the average number of accounts with spend in the preceding 90 days of 250 versus the new 500 applying the same definitions to 2017 as we now apply to 2018 our active customer accounts would have been 263000 and our core accounts would have been 77000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to providing information externally about the size of our customer base the concepts of active customer accounts and core accounts are used internally to understand customer size and potential as our business generally has gotten larger and national accounts have grown in the mix our historical definitions of these customers has become less informative the changes in definition were intended to realign our customer base into size categories that more closely align with the profile of our company today in 2018  no one customer accounted for more than 5 of our sales 

based on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing and nonresidential construction our business has historically been cyclical however we believe our model has certain protections that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes first we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing and nonresidential construction market although slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries locally or globally however we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions in addition a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products however we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain facilities and while this revenue tends to be directly influenced by cyclical changes its rate of change tends to be less dramatic 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local inmarket selling personnel as well as our nonbranch selling personnel we support our sales team with multichannel marketing including direct mail and digital marketing print and radio advertising catalogs promotional flyers events and branch signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on a nascar ®  sponsorship through our partnership with roush fenway racing ® as the primary sponsor of ricky stenhouse jrs no 17 car in the monster energy ® nascar ® cup series 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales the first and fourth quarters are typically our lowest volume periods given their overlap with winter months in north america during which our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather the fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the thanksgiving october in canada and november in the united states christmas and new year holiday periods due to plant shut downs in contrast the second and third quarters typically have higher revenues due to stronger nonresidential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays although good friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of july will always fall in the second quarter 

competition 

our business is highly competitive and includes large competitors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have branches we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products in no particular order are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

market strategies in industrial distribution are varied where products are concerned while many larger distributors have trended toward a broadline offering over time they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share this association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors though many smaller competitors do deploy a broadline model means of serving the customer are even more 

diverse for instance many competitors maintain a local branchbased presence in their markets while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales recent years have seen the emergence of ecommerce solutions such as websites and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors it also has introduced nontraditional webbased competitors into the marketplace the diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base the large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels from a single distributor where they are offered or from a range of distributors to procure the products they need in their operations 

we believe that better service and a competitive selling advantage can be provided by maintaining a physical presence closer to the customers locations as a result we maintain branches in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products the convenience of a large number of branches in a given area combined with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending and bin stock solutions supported from an inmarket branch or onsite location provides a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each inmarket location also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local branch the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low investment given the existing branch and distribution structure 

employees 

at the end of 2018 we employed 21644 full and parttime employees of these approximately 73 held an inmarket or nonbranch selling role we characterize these personnel as follows 



note – in materials released on january 17 2019 related to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings results we undercounted our total employees by 25 we corrected this in the table above and throughout this document and as a result some of the figures will not match the comparable figures in our previously published fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings results 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to develop new markets and customer relationships we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to promote from within for example most new branch and onsite managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of inmarket locations are usually former branch managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program known as fsb develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific training and development programs that are offered to our employees the programs are offered through a combination of both classroom training and online learning fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective branch best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our selling personnel are compensated with a base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a branch onsite district regional and national account basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and trade accounts receivable collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of 

the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets improvement and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and costcontainment goals 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner could disrupt operations cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues and result in less efficient operations the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities still information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their products or services or their relationship with us it is also possible that we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our information systems our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data as well as the success of our growth drivers is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable or if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations it could adversely affect our profitability andor ability to grow 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event including any cyber security event but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely we have not encountered any meaningful incidents but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a cyber security incident that may materially impact our consolidated financial statements while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business  our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new branches in recent years however we have devoted increased resources to other growth drivers including our industrial vending business our onsite business our national accounts team and our international operations while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to additional sales growth failure to achieve any of our goals regarding industrial vending fmi 

onsite locations national accounts signings digital solutions international operations or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth further failure to identify appropriate targets for our onsite and industrial vending businesses or failure to find suitable locations for them once appropriate targets are identified may adversely impact our goals regarding the number of new onsite locations we are able to open or the number of industrial vending devices we are able to deploy 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products similarly in recent years revenues from national accounts customers which typically have lower gross profit margins by virtue of their scale and available business have tended to grow faster than revenues from smaller customers this factor has become more significant as revenues from onsite locations has grown in the mix if our customer or product mix continues to change our gross profit percentage may decline further downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances customer and product mix have contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage over time including in 2018 and 2017   and will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in 2019 and beyond however whether this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are or are not offset by positive impacts to gross profit margin during such year 

our operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings  over time we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses including costs related to payroll occupancy freight and information technology among others as our net sales have grown however historically a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins there are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past for instance it is typical that when demand declines most commonly from cyclical factors though it could be due to customer losses or some other companyspecific event our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales it is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales in addition market variables such as labor rates energy costs and legal costs could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable us to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings should any of these scenarios or a combination of them occur in the future it is possible that our operating and pretax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue 

our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive and could result in failure to deploy devices  we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local branch presence allowing us to service devices more rapidly our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending devices used in and certain software and services needed to operate our industrial vending business while these devices software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in us failing to meet our goals related to the number of devices we are able to deploy in the next twelve to eighteen months 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete our ability to generate additional sales and our profit margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the selling location level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including inside and outside branch associates onsite managers national account sales representatives and support personnel who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire 

and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned expansion of our various selling channels 

our inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership in the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight andor leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles in addition difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team or recruiting suitable replacements could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations 

we may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or nontraditional competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our operating income profit andor percentage  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although slowly consolidating still remains a large fragmented and highly competitive industry our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing technological and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources technological advancements and services increased competition from brickandmortar retailers could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending similarly the emergence of online retailers whether as extensions of our traditional competition or in the form of major nontraditional competitors could result in easier and quicker price discovery and the adoption of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods these pressures could have the effect of eroding our operating income profit andor percentage over time 

our business is subject to a wide array of operating laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy and cyber security requirements regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

tax laws and regulations require compliance efforts that can increase our cost of doing business and changes to these laws and regulations could impact financial results we are subject to a variety of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate maintaining compliance with these laws can increase our cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in audits or the imposition of fines or penalties further our future effective tax rates in any of these jurisdictions could be affected positively or negatively by changing tax priorities changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof the most significant recent example of this is the comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which was enacted in the united states in december 2017 the tax act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate included a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings eliminated certain deductions for which we had previously qualified requires a current inclusion in us federal income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction in us taxable income for a portion of its foreignderived intangible income and introduced a base erosion antiabuse tax there is also a longer term risk that the beneficial aspects of the tax act on our business could be reversed depending on changes in future fiscal or political priorities 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

industry and general economic risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where we operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our inmarket locations sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those inmarket locations and other selling channels 

this risk was most recently demonstrated in 2015 and 2016 we have significant exposure to companies involved in the manufacture of capital goods and heavy equipment in 2015 our business was impacted by lower commodity prices including oil lower corporate capital spending and a strong us dollar these variables resulted in some of our customers exhibiting a reduced level of business activity and confidence when this happens these customers tend to cut back on spending which yields a slowdown in our business with these customers these same dynamics carried into 2016 in 2017 these conditions mostly reversed certain commodity prices recovered and corporate investment improved leading to better capital spending trends among our customers this improvement in customer spending helped to improve our net sales and sales growth in 2017   and throughout 2018 

new trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly and could adversely impact our operating profit percentage  we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of the united states primarily asia we have made significant structural investments over time to be able to source both directly from asia through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirectly from suppliers that procure product from international sources this was initially necessary due to the absence of significant domestic fastener production but over time we have expanded our nonfastener sourcing as well and at this time it may be difficult to adjust our sourcing in the short term in light of this changes in trade policies could affect our sourcing operations our ability to secure sufficient product to serve our customers andor impact the cost or price of our products with potentially adverse impacts on our gross and operating profit percentages and financial results these risks are particularly acute currently in light of an increase in tariffs either directly on products we trade in or indirectly on industries we sell into between the united states and its trading partners as well as greater uncertainty around regional and global trade agreements generally china and canada represent significant sources of product and canada and mexico represent our two largest markets in terms of revenue generation after the united states and each of these countries are currently andor have been previously subject to disruption due to historical trade policies there can be no assurances that these disruptions will not continue or increase in the future with the previously mentioned countries or additional countries with which we do business the degree to which these changes in the global marketplace affect our financial results will be influenced by the specific details of the changes in trade policies their timing and duration and our effectiveness in deploying tools to address these issues in particular the tariffs levied on certain products originating in china including many that we source and sell that went into effect on september 24 2018 have caused us to review and implement potential solutions to the increase in our product costs with our customers however it is too early to determine the ultimate impact and effectiveness of these discussions 

new trade policies could have an adverse impact on industries we sell into negatively affecting our net sales and profits  considerable political uncertainty in the united states may result in changes to trade policies that could create disruption in geographic demand trends to the extent that the united states government enacts tariffs or taxes that penalize imports to benefit domestic manufacturing we may improve our domestic sales which may have an overall positive impact on us given that 86 of our total revenue is derived from the united states however any such action may adversely impact our foreign sales which may in turn adversely impact our ability to expand our overseas branches in the future in addition should a foreign government engage in its own trade protection independent of or in response to another nations action it could have a negative direct or more likely indirect effect on our net sales and profits by reducing demand for exports by united states companies such changes could adversely affect our financial results 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available for reasons unrelated to trade policy which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments or changes in local economic conditions additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial or other difficulties our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing equally appealing products and services 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs can fluctuate significantly over time increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and branch operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass higher supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit to deteriorate or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take effective advantage of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions in august and september 2017 we experienced temporary disruptions in our distribution network in our gulf coast florida georgia and puerto rico regions due to hurricanes harvey irma and maria these storms adversely impacted our product demand and revenues as well as our gross and operating profit percentages due to an increase in demand for stormrelated products which have a lower gross profit margin and inefficiencies in delivery services in the immediate aftermath of the storms in september 2018 hurricane florence had a similar impact in our carolinas region 

our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that north american market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed 140 billion this figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreedupon demand and market share statistics instead we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources if we have overestimated the size of our market and in doing so underestimated our current share of it the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe similarly we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies such as industrial vending and onsite locations we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 17 million devices and we have identified over 15000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model similar to the case for total market size we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker 

than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or onsite service models as we anticipate to reach the full market opportunity 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase the cost of purchasing products and impact our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations with the canadian dollar and other foreign currencies will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are not currently using these instruments and we have not historically hedged this exposure if we decide to do so in the future we could potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results as of december 31 2018  we had 5000  of outstanding debt obligations including loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility of 3650  and senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement in the aggregate principal amount of 1350  loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on november 30 2023 the notes issued under our master note agreement consist of three series the first is in an aggregate principal amount of 400 bears interest at a fixed rate of 200 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2021 the second is in an aggregate principal amount of 350 bears interest at a fixed rate of 245 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2022 the third is in an aggregate principal amount of 600 bears interest at a fixed rate of 322 per annum and is due and payable on march 1 2024 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the credit facility is 7000 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the master note agreement is 6000 however none of the institutional investors that are parties to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the credit market turmoil of 2008 and 2009 did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased our indebtedness has increased since 2009 and we have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return or if interest rates continue to rise the cost of servicing our existing debt could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high 

investment risk 

there can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time  stock prices including ours are commonly thought to be a function of earnings multiplied by a multiple historically investors have given our earnings a higher multiple or premium than is typical of the broader industrial sector of which we are typically associated we believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth profitability and returns however to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies andor poorly navigate the risks that surround our business including those described throughout this section or to the extent our industry industrial distribution or industrial stocks in general loses favor in the marketplace there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program  although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2018 2017 and prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 3100  inmarket locations most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both oem and mro customers the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our branches and customers are primarily located in north america 

it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big we estimate the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america and no company has a significant portion of this market 2 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive but the cost and time to manage procure and transport these products can be quite meaningful 3 purchasing professionals often expend disproportionate effort managing the high sku count of lowvolume low value mro supplies which is better allocated to their higher volume higher value oem supplies 4 many customers prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business while also utilizing various technologies and models including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly to improve availability and reduce waste 5 we believe the markets are efficient to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customer 

our approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto growth through customer service  the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind our customerfacing resources to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we strive to generate strong profits which produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers lastly we identify drivers that allow us to get closer to our customers and gain market share 

we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can serve our customers at the closest economic point of contact at one point the closest economic point of contact was the local branch today in some cases we have moved the branch inside the customers facility we also are frequently positioned right at the point of consumption within customers facilities through our industrial vending or fmi capabilities therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles by doing these things every day fastenal remains a growthcentric organization 

executive overview 

net sales increas ed 5746 or 131 in 2018   relative to 2017 our gross profit as a percentage of net sal es declined to 483 in 2018 from 493 in   2017 our operating income as a percentage of net sal es in 2018 was comparable to 2017 at 201 in both years 

our net earnings in 2018 were 7519 an increase of 299 when compared to 2017 our diluted net earnings per share were 262 in 2018 compared to 201 in 2017 an increase of 305 both periods included discrete tax items primarily related to the tax act excluding these discrete items a benefit of 71 in 2018 and a benefit of 244 in 2017 our net earnings in 2018 would have been 7448 an increase of 344 when compared to 2017 further our diluted net earnings per share would have been 259 in 2018 compared to 192 in 2017 an increase of 349 a portion of this increase relates to a lower tax rate in 2018 that is a feature of the tax act 

we continued to focus on our growth drivers in 2018 we si gned 152 new national account contracts defined as new customer accounts with a multisite contract and our national accounts revenues grew 181 in the period additionally we signed 336 new o nsite customer locations   defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within or in close proximity to the customers facility and 22073 new industria l vending devices sales growth in 2018 exceeded 20 through both our vending devices and our onsite locations excluding sales transferred from a branch 

the table below summarizes our total employee headcount our investments in inmarket locations defined as the sum of the total number of public branch locations and the total number of active onsite locations and industrial vending devices at the end of the periods presented and the percentage change compared to the end of the prior period 



1  this number primarily represents devices which principally dispense product and produce product revenues and excludes approximately 15000 devices that are part of a locker lease program where the devices are principally used for the checkincheckout of equipment 

during the last twelve months we increased our absolute employee headcount by 591 people in our inmarket locations and 1079 people in total this increase is mostly a function of additions we have made to support customer growth in the field as well as investments in our growth drivers 

we opened 11 branches and closed 157 branches in 2018 additionally ten branches were converted from public branches to nonpublic locations our inmarket network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open or close locations as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network and support our growth drivers 

results of operations 

the following sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information as a percentage of net sales for the periods ended december 31 



net sales 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period the table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended december 31 and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period 

the increase in net sales noted above for 2018 was a result of higher unit sales and to a lesser degree higher prices higher product prices were realized throughout 2018 as a result of actions beginning initially in late 2017 taken to offset increases in product costs and we believe these increases contributed 07 to 08 to growth for the year the increases in net sales for 2017 and 2016 were driven primarily by higher unit sales price increases were not a material factor in 2017 or 2016 

the higher unit sales in 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from two sources the first is improvement in underlying market demand we believe the improvement in general business activity is reflected in a number of metrics for instance the us purchasing managers index published by the institute for supply chain management averaged 588 in 2018 and 576 in 2017 readings above 50 are indicative of growing demand and we believe the levels described above were consistent with favorable business conditions and consistent with an increase in our sales growth rates this was reflected as well in daily sales of fasteners our most cyclical product line which grew 112 and 84 in 2018 and 2017 respectively we also experienced growth in sales to 84 of our top 100 customers in 2018 which compares to growth in sales to 79 of our top 100 customers in 2017 

the second source is success within our growth initiatives we signed 22073 industrial vending devices during 2018 an increase of 140 over 2017 in addition to an increase in our installed base we achieved a lowsingle digit increase in average sales per device these variables combined to generate sales growth through our vending devices in excess of 20 in 2018 we signed 336 new onsite locations in 2018 an increase of 244 over 2017 and had 894 active sites on december 31 2018 an increase of 478 over december 31 2017 we signed 152 new national account contracts in 2018 the contribution of these new contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 181 in 2018 compared to 2017 

we signed 19355 industrial vending devices during 2017 an increase of 72 over 2016 in addition to an increase in our installed base we were also more efficient with the existing base resulting in a modest increase in average sales per device and a decrease in our device removals of 38 combined sales through our vending devices accelerated throughout 2017 finishing with growth in the high teens we signed 270 new onsite locations in 2017 an increase of 534 over 2016 and had 605 active sites on december 31 2017 an increase of 509 over december 31 2016 we signed 168 new national account contracts in 2017 the contribution of these new contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 145 in 2017 compared to 2016 

in 2016 we saw relative weakness from nonresidential construction and heavy manufacturing customers and in demand for our fastener products speaking to the sustained softness in heavy and general industrial markets business with our largest customers was also relatively weak with sales to our top 100 customers rising modestly in the first half of 2016 and falling modestly in the second half of 2016 while these trends were representative of conditions in the united states and canada total sales outside of these geographic areas were relatively strong and improved over the course of 2016 net sales in 2016 were also impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth we experienced success with our growth initiatives in 2016 similar to 2017 and 2018 however their impact to our net sales growth in 2016 was largely offset by a weaker economic environment 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales arises from two factors first we believe nonfastener products represent a larger market opportunity than fasteners and that we are relatively underrepresented in this market over time this has led to faster growth in the nonfastener product lines a trend amplified by the growth of our industrial vending program through which we sell primarily nonfastener products we believe this factor impacted each year shown and will continue to promote a lower mix of fasteners in our total sales over time second a weak industrial production environment has a disproportionately negative effect on fastener sales relative to nonfastener sales which relates more to plant operations than production this weakness is more of a cyclical factor than a structural one and as such was relevant in 2016 but not in 2017 or 2018 when a better economic environment at least partially mitigated the first factor discussed 

annual sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

annual sales changes by month 

during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days andor seasons impact certain end markets particularly nonresidential construction the first landing centers on easter and the good friday holiday that precedes it which alternates between march and april good friday occurred in march 2018 april 2017 and march 2016 and will fall in april in 2019 the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our nonresidential construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average 20132017 we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2018 2017 and 2016 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 18delta 17delta and 16delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 

it is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages in a year where demand is strong our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it in a year where demand is weak we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it in both cases there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform 



1  the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – we estimate approximately 65 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market the daily sales growth rates to these manufacturing customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  



1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line approximately 35 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the daily sales growth rates of fasteners noted in the table above for first quarter of 2018 and the second third and fourth quarters of 2017 include 37 36 38 and 39 percentage points respectively attributable to mansco acquired on march 31 2017 

by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business has enjoyed superior growth in the strong 2018 and 2017 periods when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general further while not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment as was experienced in 2016 our nonfastener business did demonstrate greater relative resilience when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general we believe this is due to both the growth of our vending business and our lower penetration of the nonfastener marketplace relative to our penetration of the fastener marketplace 

our nonresidential construction and reseller customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  

1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our nonresidential construction and reseller business is heavily influenced by the manufacturing economy as well as infrastructure spending in 2018 and 2017 improving trends for commodities such as metals and energy industrial capital spending and the state of the broader economy contributed to an improvement in growth for these end markets in 2016 volatility and weakness in commodity markets particularly energy and lower industrial capital spending contributed to slower growth 

gross profit 

the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 483 in 2018 and 493 in 2017 the gross profit percentage for 2018 declined by 100 basis points based on three elements 1 a change in product and customer mix fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers our fastener product line declined to 349 of sales in 2018 from 356 of sales in 2017 larger customers for which national accounts are a good proxy whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing also influence the gross profit margin sales to our national account customers increased to 512 in 2018 from 487 of sales in 2017 the combination of relatively slower growth in our fastener product line and relatively faster growth in sales to our largest customers contributed to the decline in our overall gross profit margin in 2018 2 rising costs related to transporting products particularly shipping fees driver wages and fuel caused our freight expense to rise faster than sales hurting our gross profit margin since we operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers our distribution centers and our inmarket locations rising transportation costs adversely impact our gross profit margin and have the effect of reducing our gross profit particularly if we are unable to pass these costs to our customers 3 we have experienced inflation that has caused the cost of many of the products we purchase to rise we have instituted price increases aimed at mitigating the effects of these cost increases but we believe these actions have lagged in their ability to offset rising costs for our products particularly fasteners in 2018 

during 2017 and 2016 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the prior year in each year the decrease was primarily caused by the changes in product and customer mix noted above as well as the acquisition of mansco in 2017 manscos customer mix is more heavily oriented toward larger customers and its product mix tends to carry a lower gross profit product mix than the companys other products 

operating and administrative expenses 

our operating and administrative expenses including the gain on sales of property and equipment as a percentage of net sales improved to 282 in 2018 from 292 in 2017 this improvement was a function of the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses being more modest than the growth in sales each of these reduced the ratio of operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by approximately 30 to 40 basis points in 2018 from 2017 

the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and all other operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year is outlined in the table below 

employeerelated expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes our employeerelated expenses increased in 2018 this was related to 1 an increase in fulltime equivalent fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution 4 increases in hourly base wages and 5 increased health care costs the increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was related to 1 an increase in fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings as well as regulatory driven incremental compensation 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution and options awards 4 increased health care costs and 5 the inclusion of mansco personnel the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was caused by increases in average annual fte headcount and an increase in health care costs which were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth gross profit and operating income both on a dollar basis and on a relative basis 

the table below summarizes the percentage change in our fte headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period 



occupancyrelated expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our branches and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our inmarket operations and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expense the increase in occupancyrelated expenses in 2018 when compared to 2017 was mainly driven by increases related to industrial vending equipment and nonbranch occupancy and utility costs only partly offset by a slight decline in branch occupancy costs from a lower public branch count the slight increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was mainly driven by increases in costs related to industrial vending equipment fmi bins and automation equipment at our distribution centers the most significant components of our occupancyrelated expenses facility costs and utility expenses were mostly flat in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to a reduction in our number of public branches the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was mainly driven by an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment and to a lesser degree an increase in occupancy expense related to rent 

all other operating and administrative expenses include 1 sellingrelated transportation 2 information technology it expenses and 3 general corporate expenses which consists of legal expenses general insurance expenses travel and marketing expenses etc all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to an increase in sellingrelated transportation expenses consisting of both higher vehicle movement and fuel costs as well as higher it spending general corporate expenses were slightly down all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 this was driven by increases in sellingrelated transportation including higher vehicle movement and fuel costs it spending and general corporate expenses all other operating and administrative expenses increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 this was driven by primarily by higher it spending while sellingrelated transportation expenses rose modestly and general corporate expenses were relatively flat 

net interest expense 

our net interest expense was 123 in 2018 compared to 87 in 2017 and 61 in 2016 the increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance during the period the increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a slightly higher average debt balance during the period 

income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 2351 in 2018 or 238 of earnings before income taxes the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the following two items 1 the lower corporate tax rate provided by the tax act resulted in a lower tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the effective income tax rate includes the immaterial impact of the us tax on certain offshore earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income gilti a new deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii and the new alternative us tax on certain base erosion antiavoidance beat payments from a us company to any foreign related party 2 discrete income tax items to adjust our transition tax liability reflect the impacts of accelerating depreciation for certain physical assets and remeasure the impact of the us tax rate on certain intercompany transactions these discrete items resulted in approximately 71  of income tax benefit during 2018 the accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act is complete as of december 31 2018 

we recorded a provisional income tax expense of 2945 in 2017 or 337 of earnings before income taxes this amount reflects a provisional estimate for the reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of 308 as a result of the income tax rate decrease included in the tax act partially offset by an estimated increase in income tax payable in the amount of 65 as a result of the transition tax on cash and cash equivalent balances related to accumulated earnings associated with our international operations also included in the tax act the decrease in our income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was also related to changes in our reserve for uncertain tax positions and the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 

income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 368 for 2016  the decrease in our income tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was caused by a slight change in jurisdictional income and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions as our international business and profits grew the past several years the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states lowered our effective tax rate 

net earnings 

net earnings net earnings per share eps the percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



1 absent the impact of the tax act our net earnings for 2018 would have been 6252 an increase of 128 when compared to 2017 and our basic and diluted earnings per share would have each been 218 an increase of 133 

2 absent the impact of the tax act our net earnings for 2017 would have been 5542 an increase of 110 when compared to 2016 and our basic and diluted earnings per share would have each been 192 an increase of 112 and 113 respectively 

during 2018 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits combined with a reduction in income tax expense the increase in basic and diluted earnings per share also reflected the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2018 during 2017 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits combined with a reduction in income tax expense the slightly higher increase in basic and diluted earnings per share was primarily due to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2017 during 2016 net earnings decreased despite our nominal sales growth primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized and an increase in operating and administrative expenses the contraction of basic and diluted earnings per share was smaller due primarily to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2015 and early 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2018 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net earnings growth which resulted from higher earnings growth and a lower tax rate as a result of the tax act the decline in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings largely reflects working capital trends as further described below in 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net earnings growth the decline in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings largely reflects working capital trends and specifically accounts receivable in 2016 the slight contraction in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by our initiative to add additional products into branch inventory under our csp 16 format and an increase in net accounts receivable growth this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in net cash paid for income taxes 

operational working capital 

operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories is highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

in 2018 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects accelerating growth in sales throughout the course of the year combined with relatively stronger growth of our national accounts and international business in addition two trends emerged among our customer base that increased our net accounts receivable the first was a push from our customers to contractually increase the period between when they are invoiced and when payment is due the second was customers delaying payments beyond the end of the applicable quarter we saw these behaviors intensify throughout 2018 in 2017 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects accelerating growth in sales throughout the course of the year combined with relatively stronger growth of our national accounts and international business growth in accounts receivable continued in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the timing of the christmas and new year holidays affecting the timing of these customers payments currency fluctuations also impacted accounts receivable in 2017 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as tight a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable one reason for this is cyclical the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns so economic downturns can cause a spike in inventory levels as was seen in the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 inventories may also fluctuate independent of monthly sales patterns based on strategic decisions for instance at various times we have increased our relative inventory levels based on new branch openings expanded stocking breadth at distribution centers andor individual branches eg csp expanded direct sourcing and expanded fastenal brands our growth drivers including industrial vending solutions national accounts and onsite and international locations have also required significant investments in inventory in 2018 our inventories increased as a result of growth in general demand and successful execution of our growth drivers inflation had an increasing impact in the second half of 2018 and our decision to accelerate shipments of product to the us from overseas ahead of potential tariffs resulted in extra inventory of approximately 120 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in 2017 the most significant contributor to the increase in inventories was improving business activity and the growth of our onsite business 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities were primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below for each period and cash paid for acquisitions in 2017 

net capital expenditures purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



note – a reconciliation of net capital expenditures is outlined in the table below 

our net capital expenditures increased in 2018 when compared to 2017 primarily due to increased spending on hub property and equipment both to expand current capacity and for potential future expansion as well as vending devices to support the growth of our industrial vending program our net capital expenditures decreased in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to lower spending in 2017 related to 1 the absence of spending on vending equipment that occurred in 2016 related to the leased locker rollout 2 the absence of spending on shelving and signage that occurred in 2016 for the csp 16 initiative and 3 timing associated with the addition of pickup trucks our net capital expenditures increased in 2016 primarily due to the purchase of industrial vending devices related to the leased locker program we signed in february 2016 and spending on automation in certain distribution centers 

property and equipment expenditures in 2018  2017  and 2016  consisted of 1 the purchase of software and hardware for our information processing systems 2 the addition of fleet vehicles 3 the purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to branch openings and our csp 16 initiative 4 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased branch properties 6 purchases related to industrial vending and 7 costs related to enhancements to distribution centers including automated systems equipment disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several branch locations 

set forth below is a recap of our 2018  2017  and 2016  net capital expenditures 



we expect our net capital expenditures in 2019 to be within a range of 1950 to 2250 this increase is a result of higher spending for property and equipment to expand our hub capacity vending devices and hub vehicles with our investments in hub capacity likely to be the primary determinant of where we fall within our range we anticipate funding our capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net proceeds from debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases 

in 2018 we purchased 2000000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 5150 per share in 2017 we purchased 1900000 shares at an average price of approximately 4343 per share and in 2016 we purchased 1600000 shares at an average price of approximately 3715 per share 

dividends

debt 

in order to fund the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business to increase the use of automation in our distribution centers to purchase our common stock and pay dividends and to fund the acquisition of mansco on march 31 2017 we have borrowed under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility peaked during each quarter of 2018 and 2017 as follows 



as of december 31 2018 we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 3650  and contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 363  as of december 31 2018  we also had loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 1350  descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings 

approximately 1184 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the 

tax act the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation 

throughout 2018 we experienced increasing product cost inflation for nonfastener and especially fastener products we took actions in the latter part of 2017 and throughout 2018 including pricing adjustments to offset this inflation while we succeeded in raising prices through the year we were not able to do so at the same rate that our costs rose which negatively affected our profit margins and earnings in 2018 apart from generalized inflation tariffs were instituted on certain products that we source from china but this occurred later in the year and did not have a meaningful impact on sales or profits in 2018 throughout 2017 we experienced increasing product cost inflation particularly in our fastener products we were able to take actions during the period including pricing adjustments to mostly offset this inflation in the aggregate the overall impact of inflation and pricing on sales and profits was not material in 2017 during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in our fastener products which was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances historical experience and actuarial valuations actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

our most significant accounting policies including revenue recognition and inventories are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations our most critical accounting estimates include the following 

allowance for doubtful accounts  – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs our methodology for estimating this reserve includes ongoing reviews of the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

inventory obsolescence reserves  – these reserves are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels sales information and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product our methodology for estimating these reserves is continually evaluated for factors that could require changes to the reserves including significant changes in product demand market conditions condition of the inventory or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

general insurance reserves  – these reserves are for general claims related to workers compensation property and casualty losses and other general liability selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends we perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels we analyze historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts

as of december 31 2018 we had outstanding longterm debt and facilities equipment and vehicles leased under operating leases our future obligations to pay principal of and interest on such longterm debt and to make minimum lease payments under such operating leases are as follows 



1 interest on the longterm debt outstanding under our credit facility was calculated using the interest rates and balances at december 31 2018 

purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above our purchase orders are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities 

liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these liabilities which we believe will be immaterial a discussion of income taxes is contained in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law the financial information included in this form 10k reflects the impact of the enactment of the tax act our net earnings and basic and diluted net earnings per share for 2017 and 2018 excluding the impact of the tax act or certain discrete tax items related to the tax act are nongaap financial measures management believes reporting these measures will help investors understand the effect of tax reform on comparable reported results and the comparable gaap measure without these adjustments precedes any disclosure that excludes the impact of the tax act or certain discrete items related to the tax act

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates  – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments our operations in countries other than the us and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end we have not historically hedged our foreign currency risk given that exposure to date has not been material 

commodity steel pricing  – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners during 2018 we experienced inflation in the cost of steel products during 2017 we experienced some inflation in the cost of steel products during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in the cost of steel products this deflation was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 

commodity energy prices  – we have market risk for changes in prices of gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity 

prices for these commodities began to ease late in the year but for most of 2018 we saw rising costs for these commodities and that resulted in increases in fuel costs for our hub and fieldbased vehicles and utility costs for our inmarket locations distribution centers and manufacturing facilities fossil fuels are also often a key feedstock for chemicals and plastics that comprise a key raw material for many products that we sell as a result rising costs for these commodities in recent months are resulting in higher costs for many of these products we believe that over time these risks are mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight and product costs to our customers the efficiency of our trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency 

interest rates   loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates tied to libor or if libor is no longer available at a replacement rate to be determined by the administrative agent for the credit facility and consented to by us as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a one percentage point increase in libor in 2018 would have resulted in approximately 30 of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first branch in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 27000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies that we break into twelve product lines described later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2017 we had 2988  inmarket locations defined in the table below in 24 countries supported by 14 distribution centers in north america 11 in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and we employed 20565  people we believe our success can be attributed to the high quality of our employees and their convenient proximity to our customers and our ability to offer customers a full range of products and services to reduce their total cost of procurement 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year as well as the number of public branches onsite locations and total inmarket locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



1 onsite location information prior to 2014 is intentionally omitted while such locations have existed since 1992 we did not specifically track their number until we identified our onsite program as a growth driver in 2014 

2 inmarket locations is defined as the sum of the total number of public branches and the total number of onsite locations 

one of fastenals guiding principles since inception is that we can improve our service by getting closer to the customer through much of our history this was achieved by opening branches and today we believe there are few companies that offer our north american branch coverage in our view this has proved to be an efficient means of providing customers with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis these branches have represented and continue to represent the foundation of our service approach however we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our branch network and in recent years we have developed additional models that get us still closer to the customer including vending bin stocks and onsite locations 

we currently have several versions of selling locations 1 a traditional or public branch services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of products we offer 2 an overseas branch focuses on manufacturing customers and our fastener product line and is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada 3 a strategic account branch is a unique location that sells to multiple large accounts in a market 4 a strategic account site is similar to a strategic account branch but typically operates out of an existing branch rather than from a unique location and 5 an onsite location defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within or in close proximity to the customers facility 

traditional overseas and strategic account branches sell to multiple customers and together comprise our total branch count our strategic account sites are considered an extension of the branch from which it operates and are not included separately in our total branch counts onsite locations which serve a single customer are similarly not included in our total branch counts however outside of the fact that they serve a single customer we believe the function and operation of an onsite location is similar to that of a branch this model is also beginning to represent a meaningful portion of the companys total revenue and we expect that share to grow materially over time as a result we have begun to refer to our network in terms of inmarket locations which includes our total branches and onsite locations and we began to refer to strategic account sites as noninmarket locations 

branch locations  are selected primarily based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction companies we stock all new branches with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and over time where appropriate our district and branch personnel may tailor the inventory offering to the needs of the local customer base since fastenals founding and through 2013 branch openings were a primary growth driver for the company and we experienced net openings each year over that time span we have long 

maintained that marketplace demographics could support a north american network of 3500 traditional branches however since establishing this figure new growth drivers and business models onsite vending ecommerce have emerged and diminished the direct role of traditional branch openings in our growth it is now unlikely that we will operate the total traditional branch locations we previously believed would be the potential of north america we will continue to open traditional branches as the company sees fit however in each year since 2013 the company has experienced a net decline in its total branch count including net declines of 15 branches in 2015 119 branches in 2016 and 120 branches in 2017 

there is one branch subset overseas that we anticipate expanding in the future selling locations outside of the united states and canada contributed approximately 7 of our consolidated net sales in 2017 with approximately 4 and 3 of this amount attributable to our mexican and restofworld operations respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the traditional overseas and strategic account branch locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the openings closings and conversions during each year

5 south africa 

6  converted locations are sites converted from traditional branches to onsite locations or noninmarket locations net of sites converted from noninmarket locations or onsite locations to traditional branches 

onsite   locations  may influence the trend in total branch count over time in this model the company services a customer from a location that is physically within the customers facility or in some cases at a strategically placed offsite location with inventory that is specific to the customers needs the model is best suited to larger companies though we believe we can provide a higher degree of service at a lower level of revenue than most of our competitors in most cases we are shifting revenue with the customer from an existing branch it has been our experience however that while gross profit margins at onsite locations tend to be lower than at branches we gain significant revenue with the customer and our cost to serve is materially lower the onsite concept is not new in that we entered into the first such arrangement in 1992 however the company identified it as a growth driver in 2014 and made substantial investments toward accelerating its traction in the marketplace beginning in 2015 as a result we have identified over 15000 customer locations with potential to implement the onsite service model these customers include those where we have a national account relationship today as well as new customers we know of due to our local market presence we expect revenues from onsite arrangements to increase meaningfully over time we experienced net increases of 50 137 and 204 onsite locations in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively we currently have over 600 onsite locations and we believe we will have 1000 onsite locations in the next 12 to 18 months 

the following table provides a summary of the new onsite customer locations signed and the total onsite locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the onsite openings and closings during each year 

in 1997 we developed a national accounts  program aimed at making our products and services more competitive with customers that operate multiple facilities these customers tend to have more complex supply chains and structures for managing the mro and oem products we provide while at the same time by virtue of their size and opportunity have more negotiating power we believe our local presence as part of a national and increasingly international footprint our ability to provide a consistent level of hightouch service and broad product availability and our ancillary capabilities around manufacturing quality control and product knowledge are attractive to these larger customers we believe our advantage with these customers has only been strengthened as we have added other channels such as industrial vending onsite and fastenal managed inventory fmi ®  and resources to serve these customers unique demands as a result in 2017 national accounts represented 487 of our net sales compared to 474 and 464 in 2016 and 2015 respectively we believe we will continue to perform well with these customers 

we introduced industrial vending  in 2008 vending provides our customers the benefits of reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and we believe our company has a market advantage by virtue of our extensive inmarket network for these reasons the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and we finished 2017 with over 86000 devices in the field 71000 generating product revenue and 15000 in a locker lease program our discussion generally focuses on the 71000 product revenue devices we believe vending has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room to grow our current installed base before it begins to approach the number of units we believe the market can support we estimate the market could support as many as 17 million industrial vending devices and as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed devices over time we believe we will have 100000 total devices deployed in the next 12 to 18 months 

our expanded industrial vending portfolio consists of 23 different vending devices with the fast 5000 device our helixbased machine representing approximately 40 of the installed product revenue devices we have learned much about these devices over the last several years and currently the target monthly revenue ranges from under 1000 per device to in excess of 3000 per device the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of device and 2 machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as 0375 machine equivalent 0375  7502000 

the industrial vending product revenue devices information related to contracts signed during each period was as follows 



the industrial vending product revenue devices information related to installed devices at the end of each period was as follows 



in addition to industrial vending noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide fastenal managed inventory fmi  programs also known as keep fill or bin stock programs in the industry to numerous customers this business relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners fmi is like our industrial vending business in that it involves moving product closer to the point of customer use within their facilities however the device is typically an open bin which is clustered with other bins in a racking system each of which holds oem fasteners mro fasteners andor nonfastener products that are consumed in the customers operations these bins utilize a variety of technologies for instance some bins are set up with the latest scanning technologies to determine when product is at a minimum desired level and requires refill while others utilize scales to measure the volume of a bins content by its weight and our fully integrated distribution network allows us to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers fmi programs foster a strong relationship with customers as we are often their preferred supplier and a higher frequency of business transactions 

we believe our current growth drivers – onsite locations national accounts industrial vending and fmi – represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they get us closer to the customer and to where the product is actually consumed this is consistent with our strategy and offers significant value by providing differentiated and sticky service combined with ongoing strategic investments in end market initiatives such as our customer service project csp initiatives which expand inventory placement at our branches to enhance sameday capabilities as well as selling inmarket and otherwise and nonselling engineering product specialists manufacturing etc employees we offer a range of capabilities that is difficult for large and small competitors to replicate 

we remain committed to a large robust service network including traditional branches it remains the indispensable foundation of our business in any given year it is difficult to predict whether our total branch count will rise or fall however with the growth we anticipate in onsite locations we believe our total inmarket locations will increase over time 

it has been our experience that our profitability is affected by the average revenue produced by each branch while certain costs related to growth at a branch are at least partly variable such as employeerelated expenses others like rent and utility expenses tend to be fixed as a result it has been shown that as a branch increases its sales base over time it typically will achieve a higher operating profit margin this ability to increase our average revenue per branch is influenced by 1 general growth based on end market expansion andor market share gains 2 the age of the branch base new branches tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base however when these new branches mature and increase their sales base their profitability similarly increases and 3 rationalization actions – in the past several years the company has seen a net decline in its branch base there are many reasons why local or regional management might decide to close a branch key customers may have migrated to a different part of the market or transitioned to our onsite model plants may have closed or our own supply chain capabilities in a market may have evolved to allow us to service some areas with fewer traditional branches in the short term the onsite program can hurt the profitability of our existing branch network as it can pull established revenue away from an existing branch 

we operate 11 regional distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas – and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us approximately 35 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our inmarket locations using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier with approximately 83 of our north american inmarket locations receiving service four to five times per week we would expect to add new distribution centers over time as our scale and the number of our inmarket locations increases the distribution center in indiana also serves as a master hub with those in california north carolina and kansas serving as secondary hubs to support the needs of the inmarket locations in their geographic regions as well as provide a broader selection of products for the inmarket locations serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia california north carolina and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems asrs these nine distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 85 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated construction of an asrs began in 2017 at our kansas distribution center and we expect this project to be completed in the first quarter of 2018 construction of a new distribution center in washington which will include asrs technology is scheduled to begin in 2018 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized purchased and licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including growth through customer service ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

fastenal was founded as a distributor of fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies this includes threaded fasteners which represent approximately 85 of total fastener sales and includes bolts nuts screws studs and related washers as well as miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as pins machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories our fastener product line which is primarily sold under the fastenal product name represented 356 366 and 383 of our consolidated net sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively of this threaded fasteners represented approximately 30 33 and 34 of our consolidated net sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

fastener distribution is complex in most cases the product has low per unit value but high per unit weight this presents challenges in moving product from suppliers most of whom are outside of north america to our distribution centers as well as from our distribution centers to our branch onsite and customer locations at the same time fasteners are ubiquitous in manufactured products construction projects and maintenance and repair while at the same time exhibiting great geometric variability based on use and application in many cases a fastener is a critical part in machine uptime andor effective use these features have greatly influenced our logistical development training and educational programs support capabilities and inventory decisions which we believe would be difficult for competitors to replicate 

in 1993 we began to aggressively add additional product lines and these represented 644 634 and 617 of our consolidated sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively these products which we refer to as nonfastener product lines tend to move through the same distribution channel get used by the same customers and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line this logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering however over time the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line for instance nonfastener product lines benefit from our development of industrial vending 

the most significant category of nonfastener products is our safety supplies product line which accounted for 152 149 and 139 of our consolidated sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively this product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years roughly doubling as a percentage of sales over that ten year time frame this is directly related to our success in industrial vending our tools product line now accounts for more than 10 of consolidated net sales representing 101 99 and 95 in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively also in the last several years we added private label brands often referred to as fastenal brands to our offering and these represented approximately 12 of our consolidated net sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 

we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems by our sales personnel at inmarket locations by our district and regional leadership and by our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from supplier information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory 

level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all branches stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and branch personnel nonbranch selling locations primarily onsites stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

inventory held at our selling locations close to customers and available on a sameday basis accounted for approximately 65 64 and 61 of our total inventory at the end of 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively inventory held at our distribution centers and manufacturing locations accounted for approximately 35 36 and 39 of our total inventory at the end of 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the distribution center and manufacturing location inventory when combined with our trucking network allows for incredibly fast nextday service at a very competitive cost 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2017  approximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  and cardinal fasteners ®  product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to the repair of tools and hoists the fabrication of chain sling and hose band saw blade welding and other light manufacturing and fabrication we may add additional services in the future however we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect them to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales in the future 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2017  

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for distribution equipment two main suppliers for our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices as well as net sales at our foreign locations could be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products our convenient locations and diverse methods of providing those products and the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance repair and operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2017  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 400000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts each month with purchase activity of at least 250 per month was approximately 111000 in 2017  no one customer accounted for more than 5 of our sales 

based on our customer profile being oriented toward manufacturing and nonresidential construction our business has historically been cyclical however we believe our model has certain protections that moderate the volatility of our results around cyclical changes first we have a large number of customers that serve a wide range of segments within the broader manufacturing and nonresidential construction market although slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries locally or globally however we still believe this customer and market segment diversity provides some insulation from economic changes that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions in addition a meaningful part of our revenue is derived from products that are incorporated into final products however we also have a significant portion of revenue that is derived from products used to maintain sites and while this revenue tends to be directly influenced by cyclical changes its rate of change tends to be less dramatic 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local inmarket selling personnel as well as our nonbranch selling personnel we support our branches with multichannel marketing including email and online marketing print and radio advertising catalogs promotional flyers events and branch signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on a nascar ®  sponsorship through our partnership with roush fenway racing ® as the primary sponsor of ricky stenhouse jrs no 17 car in the monster energy ® nascar ® cup series 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales the first and fourth quarters are typically our lowest volume periods given their overlap with winter months in north america during which our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather the fourth quarter also tends to be more greatly affected by the thanksgiving october in canada and november in the united states christmas and new year holiday periods due to plant shut downs in contrast the second and third quarters typically have higher revenues due to stronger nonresidential construction activity and relatively fewer holidays although good friday will sometimes fall in the second quarter and the 4th of july will always fall in the second quarter 

competition 

our business is highly competitive and includes large competitors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have branches we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products in no particular order are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

market strategies in industrial distribution are varied where products are concerned while many larger distributors have trended toward a broadline offering over time they are often still closely associated with a specific product that can influence their ability to capture market share this association with a specific product line is often even more pronounced among smaller competitors though many smaller competitors do deploy a broadline model means of serving the customer are even more diverse for instance many competitors maintain a local branchbased presence in their markets while others use vans to sell products in markets away from their main warehouses while still others rely on catalogs or telemarketing sales recent years have seen the emergence of digital solutions such as websites and while this channel has been embraced by many traditional distributors it also has introduced nontraditional ecommercebased competitors into the marketplace the diversity of product and service models supported in the marketplace is a reflection of the equally diverse product and service needs of the customer base the large majority of our customers utilize multiple channels from a single distributor where they are offered or from a range of distributors to procure the products they need in their operations 

we believe that better service and a competitive selling advantage can be provided by maintaining a physical presence closer to the customers locations as a result we maintain branches in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products the convenience of a large number of branches in a given area combined with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such branches from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending and bin stock solutions supported from an inmarket branch or onsite location provides a unique way to provide our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each inmarket location also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local branch the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low investment given the existing branch and distribution structure 

employees 

at the end of 2017 we employed 20565 full and parttime employees of these approximately 74 held an inmarket or nonbranch selling role we characterize these personnel as follows 



we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to develop new markets and customer relationships we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to promote from within for example most new branch and onsite managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of inmarket locations are usually former branch managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program known as fsb develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific education and training programs that are offered to our employees fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective branch best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our selling personnel are compensated with a base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a branch onsite district regional and national account basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and trade accounts receivable collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business  our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new branches in recent years however we have devoted increased resources to other growth drivers including our industrial vending business our onsite business and our national accounts team while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to additional sales growth failure to achieve any of our goals regarding industrial vending onsite locations national accounts signings or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth further failure to identify appropriate customer sites for our onsite businesses or failure to find suitable locations for our onsite businesses once appropriate customer sites are identified may adversely impact our goals regarding the number of new onsite locations we are able to open 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products similarly in recent years revenues from national accounts customers which typically have lower gross profit margins by virtue of their scale and available business have tended to grow faster than revenues from smaller customers this factor has become more significant as revenues from onsite locations has grown in the mix if our customer or product mix continues to change our gross profit percentage may decline further downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances customer and product mix have contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage over time including in 2017 and 2016 and will likely continue to affect our gross profit percentage in 2018 and beyond however whether this adverse mix impact will result in a decline of our gross profit percentage in any given year will depend on the extent to which they are or are not offset by positive impacts to gross profit margin during such year 

our operating and administrative expenses could grow more rapidly than net sales which could result in failure to achieve our goals related to leveraging revenue growth into higher net earnings  over time we have generally experienced an increase in our operating and administrative expenses including costs related to payroll occupancy freight and information technology among others as our net sales have grown however historically a portion of these expenses has not increased at the same rates as net sales allowing us to leverage our growth and sustain or expand our operating profit margins there are various scenarios where we may not be able to continue to achieve this leverage as we have been able to do in the past for instance it is typical that when demand declines most commonly from cyclical factors though it could be due to customer losses or some other companyspecific event our operating and administrative expenses do not fall as quickly as net sales it is also possible that in the future we will elect to make investments in operating and administrative expenses that would result in costs growing faster than net sales in addition market variables such as labor rates energy costs and legal costs could move in such a way as to cause us to not be able to manage our operating and administrative expenses in a way that would enable us to leverage our revenue growth into higher net earnings should any of these scenarios or a combination of them occur in the future it is possible that our operating and pretax profit margins could decline even if we are able to grow revenue 

our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive and could result in failure to deploy devices  we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local branch presence allowing us to service devices more rapidly our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending devices used in and certain software and services needed to operate our industrial vending business while these devices software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive and could result in us failing to meet our goals related to the number of devices we are able to deploy in the next twelve to eighteen months 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and profit margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the selling location level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including inside and outside branch associates onsite managers and national account sales representatives who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new branches and planned expansion of our other selling channels 

our inability to attract or transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership and adversely impact our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our key executive officers and senior leadership in the event of voluntary or involuntary vacancies in our executive team in the future the extent to which there is disruption in the oversight andor leadership of our business will depend on our ability to either transition internal talented individuals or recruit suitable replacements to serve in these roles in addition difficulties in smoothly implementing any transition to new members of our executive team or recruiting suitable replacements could divert the attention of other members of our senior leadership team from our existing operations 

we may not be able to compete effectively against traditional or nontraditional competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our operating income  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although slowly consolidating still remains a large fragmented and highly competitive industry our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing technological and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources technological advancements and services increased competition from brick and mortar retailers in markets in which we have inmarket locations or from online retailers particularly those major internet providers who can offer a wide range of products and rapid delivery and the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our operating income 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their relationship with us if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide 

to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

if we experience a loss related to our information systems or are unable to maintain or upgrade our information systems or convert to alternate systems in a timely and efficient manner our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient we depend on information systems for many aspects of our business and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner we could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our information systems difficulties resulting from the transition of our industrial vending hosting services could also be disruptive to the success of our efforts to grow our industrial vending presence the success of our growth drivers is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth drivers could delay the achievement of our goals regarding these growth drivers 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy and cyber security requirements regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in particular our future effective tax rates could be affected by legislative tax reform changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof in addition notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate included in the recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the overall impact of the tax act on our future financial results is subject to uncertainties and our financial results could be adversely impacted by certain other aspects of the tax act including onetime taxes on accumulated offshore earnings requiring a current inclusion in us federal income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations allowing a domestic corporation an immediate deduction in us taxable income for a portion of its foreignderived intangible income and the base erosion antiabuse tax these factors could result in our 2018 provisional income tax expense booking rate to differ from our expectations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

industry and general economic risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where we operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our inmarket locations sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those inmarket locations and other selling channels 

this risk was demonstrated in 2015 and 2016 we have significant exposure to companies involved in the manufacture of capital goods and heavy equipment in 2015 our business was impacted by lower commodity prices including oil lower corporate capital spending and a strong us dollar these variables resulted in some of our customers exhibiting a reduced level of business activity and confidence when this happens these customers tend to cut back on spending which yields a slowdown in our business with these customers these same dynamics carried into 2016 in 2017 these conditions mostly reversed certain commodity prices recovered and corporate investment improved leading to better capital spending trends among our customers this improvement in customer spending helped to improve our net sales and sales growth 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions or trade issues additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial or other difficulties our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing equally appealing products and services 

new trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly  we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of the united states primarily asia this sourcing is both direct through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirect from suppliers that themselves procure product from international sources considerable political uncertainty in the united states may result in changes to trade policies that may affect our sourcing operations should this occur it may be difficult in light of the significant structural investments made over time and the absence of significant domestic fastener production for us to adjust our capabilities to any new policies in the short term which could increase the difficulty andor cost of sourcing products such changes could adversely affect our ability to secure sufficient product to service our customers andor adversely affect our cost of operating in a way that hurts our financial results 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and branch operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit 

to deteriorate or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

new trade policies could have an adverse impact on industries we sell into negatively affecting our net sales and profits  considerable political uncertainty in the united states may result in changes to trade policies that could create disruption in geographic demand trends to the extent that the united states government enacts tariffs or taxes that penalize imports to benefit domestic manufacturing we may improve our domestic sales which may have an overall positive impact on us given that 88 of our total revenue is derived from the united states however any such action may adversely impact our foreign sales which may in turn adversely impact our ability to expand our overseas branches in the future in addition should a foreign government engage in its own trade protection independent of or in response to another nations action it could have a negative direct or more likely indirect effect on our net sales and profits by reducing demand for exports by united states companies it is difficult to know in advance what the net effect of such actions will be on companies such as ours but it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our financial results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our branch network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions in august and september 2017 we experienced temporary disruptions in our distribution network in our gulf coast florida georgia and puerto rico regions due to hurricanes harvey irma and maria these storms adversely impacted our product demand and revenues as well as our gross and operating profit percentages due to an increase in demand for stormrelated products which have a lower gross profit margin and inefficiencies in delivery services in the immediate aftermath of the storms 

our current estimates of total market potential as well as the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect we believe we have a significant opportunity for growth based on our belief that north american market demand for the products we sell is estimated to exceed 140 billion this figure is not derived from an independent organization or data source that aggregates and publishes widely agreedupon demand and market share statistics instead we have identified this figure based on our own experience in the marketplace for our products and by evaluating estimates from other sources if we have overestimated the size of our market and in doing so underestimated our current share of it the size of our opportunity for growth may not be as significant as we currently believe similarly we have provided estimates of the opportunities we have with some of our specific growth strategies such as industrial vending and onsite locations we believe the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 17 million devices and we have identified over 15000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model similar to the case for total market size we use our own experience and data to arrive at the size of these potential opportunities and not independent sources these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations due to a change in the marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will ultimately decide to expand our industrial vending or onsite service models to reach the full market opportunity 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and impact our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely 

impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing and interest rate fluctuations could adversely impact our results as of december 31 2017  we had 4150  of outstanding debt obligations including loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility of 2800  and senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement in the aggregate principal amount of 1350  loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on march 10 2020 the notes issued under our master note agreement consist of three series the first is in an aggregate principal amount of 400 bears interest at a fixed rate of 200 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2021 the second is in an aggregate principal amount of 350 bears interest at a fixed rate of 245 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2022 the third is in an aggregate principal amount of 600 bears interest at a fixed rate of 322 per annum and is due and payable on march 1 2024 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the credit facility is 7000 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the master note agreement is 2000 however none of the institutional investors party to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the credit market turmoil of 2008 and 2009 did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased our indebtedness has increased since 2009 and we have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return or if interest rates rise the cost of servicing our existing debt could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high

investment risk 

there can be no assurance that our stock price will continue to reflect the current multiple of earnings over time  stock prices including ours are commonly thought to be a function of earnings multiplied by a multiple historically investors have given our earnings a higher multiple or premium than is typical of the broader industrial sector of which we are typically associated we believe we have earned this premium by virtue of a long history of superior growth profitability and returns however to the extent that we fail to successfully execute our growth strategies andor poorly navigate the risks that surround our business including those described throughout this section or to the extent our industry industrial distribution or industrial stocks in general loses favor in the marketplace there can be no assurance that investors will continue to afford a premium multiple to our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share purchase program  although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we purchased shares in 2017 2016 and prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 3000  inmarket locations most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance repair and operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our branches and customers are primarily located in north america 

it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is estimated to be in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america and no company has a significant portion of this market 2 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive but the cost and time to manage procure and transport these products can be quite meaningful 3 purchasing professionals often expend disproportionate effort managing the high sku count of lowvolume low value mro supplies which is better allocated to their higher volume higher value oem supplies 4 many customers prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business while also utilizing various technologies and models including our local branches when they need something quickly or unexpectedly to improve availability and reduce waste 5 we believe the markets are efficient to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customer 

our approach to addressing these aspects of our marketplace is captured in our motto growth through customer service  the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind our customerfacing resources to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we strive to generate strong profits which produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers lastly we identify drivers that allow us to get closer to our customers and gain market share 

we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can serve our customers at the closest economic point of contact at one point the closest economic point of contact was the local branch today in some cases we have moved the branch inside the customers facility we also are frequently positioned right at the point of consumption within customers facilities through our industrial vending or fmi capabilities therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles by doing these things every day fastenal remains a growthcentric organization 

executive overview 

net sales increas ed 4285 or 108 in 2017 relative to 2016 our gross profit as a percentage of net sal es declined to 493 in 2017 from 496 in   2016 our operating income as a percentage of net sal es in 2017 was comparable to 2016 at 201 in b oth years   

we recorded a provisional income tax expense of 2945 in 2017 or 337 of earnings before income taxes this amount reflects an estimated reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of 308 as a result of the income tax rate decrease included in the tax act offset by an estimated increase in income tax payable in the amount of 65 as a result of the transition tax on cash and cash equivalent balances related to accumulated earnings associated with our international operations also included in the tax act absent the impact of the tax act our income tax expense for 2017 would have been approximately 3188 or 365 of earnings before income taxes income tax expense was 2903 in 2016 or 368 of earnings before income taxes 

our net earnings in 2017 were 5786 an increase of 158 when compared to 2016 our diluted net earnings per share were 201 in 201 7 compared to 173  in   2 016 if we excluded the discrete items that benefited our income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to the impact of the tax act our net earnings in the period would have been approximately 5542 an increase of 110 when compared to 2016 and our diluted net earnings per share would have been 192 

we continued to focus on our growth drivers in 2017 we si gned 168 new national account contracts defined as new customer accounts with a multisite contract additionally we signed 270 new   onsite customer locations   defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within or in close proximity to the customers facility and 19355 new industria l vending devices   

the table below summarizes our inmarket location employee count and our total employee count at the end of the periods presented and changes in that count from the end of the prior periods to the end of the most recent period the final four items below summarize our cumulative investments in branch locations onsite locations total inmarket locations and industrial vending devices 



1  inmarket locations is defined as the sum of the total number of public branch locations and the total number of active onsite locations 

2  this number represents devices which principally dispense product and produce product revenues and excludes approximately 15000 devices which are principally used for the checkincheckout of equipment 

during the last twelve months we increased our headcount by 458 people in our inmarket locations and 941 people in total our total headcount at the end of 2017 includes 127 people related to our mansco acquisition the remaining increase is mostly a function of additions we have made to support customer growth in the field as well as investments in our growth drivers 

we opened 18 branches and closed 130 branches in 2017 additionally eight branches were converted from public branches to nonpublic locations our branch network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open or close branches as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network and support our growth drivers 

results of operations 

the following sets forth consolidated statements of earnings information as a percentage of net sales for the periods ended december 31 



net sales 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 

the table below sets forth net sales and daily sales for the periods ended december 31 and changes in such sales from the prior period to the more recent period 



the increases in net sales in the periods noted above for 2017 2016 and 2015 were driven primarily by higher unit sales price was not a material factor in the periods presented 

the higher unit sales in 2017 resulted primarily from two sources the first is improvement in underlying market demand we believe the improvement in general business activity is reflected in a number of metrics for instance the purchasing managers index published by the institute for supply chain management averaged 570 558 586 and 589 in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively well above 498 518 512 and 533 in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2016 respectively readings above 50 are indicative of growing demand and we believe this favorably influenced our unit sales daily sales of fasteners our most cyclical product line grew 84 in 2017 we also experienced growth in sales to 79 of our top 100 customers in 2017 which compares to growth in sales to 50 of our top 100 customers in 2016 as business conditions strengthen they tend to lift our net sales growth rates as well 

the second source is success within our growth initiatives we signed 19355 industrial vending devices during 2017 an increase of 72 over 2016 in addition to an increase in our installed base we were also more efficient with the existing base resulting in a modest increase in average sales per device and we decreased our device removals by 38 combined sales through our vending devices accelerated throughout 2017 finishing with growth in the high teens we signed 270 new onsite locations in 2017 and had 605 active sites on december 31 2017 an increase of 509 over december 31 2016 we signed 168 new national account contracts in 2017 the contribution of these new contracts and strong penetration of existing national account customers resulted in daily sales from our national account customers growing 145 in 2017 compared to 2016 

in 2016 we saw relative weakness from nonresidential construction and heavy manufacturing customers and in demand for our fastener products speaking to the sustained softness in heavy and general industrial markets business with our largest customers was also relatively weak with sales to our top 100 customers rising modestly in the first half of 2016 and falling modestly in the second half of 2016 while these trends were representative of conditions in the united states and canada total sales outside of these geographic areas were relatively strong and improved over the course of 2016 

during 2015 our business weakened compared to 2014 this initially involved customers tied to the oil and gas sector but expanded during the course of the year to include customers across additional industries and in geographic areas not typically associated with the oil and gas sector november and especially december experienced a greater frequency and duration of customer plant shutdowns than is typical of these holidayaffected periods 

net sales in 2016 and 2015 were also impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales arises from two factors first we believe nonfastener products represent a larger market opportunity than fasteners and that we are relatively underrepresented in this market over time this 

has led to faster growth in the nonfastener product lines a trend amplified by the growth of our industrial vending program through which we sell primarily nonfastener products we believe this factor impacted each year shown and will continue to promote a lower mix of fasteners in our total sales over time second a weak industrial production environment has a disproportionately negative effect on fastener sales relative to nonfastener sales which relates more to plant operations than production this weakness is more of a cyclical factor than a structural one and as such was relevant in 2015 and 2016 but not in 2017 when a better economic environment at least partially mitigated the first factor discussed 

annual sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – annual sales changes by month sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding sales changes by month provides a good mechanical view of our business the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

annual sales changes by month 

during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months where certain holidays impair business days andor seasons impact certain end markets particularly nonresidential construction the first landing centers on easter and the good friday holiday that precedes it which alternates between march and april good friday occurred in april 2017 in march 2016 in april 2015 and in 2018 will fall in march the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our nonresidential construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week the july 4th and christmasnew year holiday impacts are examples of the latter 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the trailing five year average 20122016 we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2017 2016 and 2015 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 17delta 16delta and 15delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 

it is important to note that these benchmarks are historical averages in a year where demand is strong our daily sales growth rates will tend to have more months that exceed the benchmark than fall below it in a year where demand is weak we will tend to have more months that fall short of the benchmark than exceed it in both cases there is a random element that makes it difficult to know how any single month will perform 



1  the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – we estimate approximately 65 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment market the daily sales growth rates to these manufacturing customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  



1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line 35 to 40 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the daily sales growth rates of fasteners noted in the table above for the second third and fourth quarters of 2017 include 36 38 and 39 percentage points respectively attributable to mansco acquired on march 31 2017 

by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business demonstrated greater relative resilience over the last several years when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our industrial vending program however this business was not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment 

our nonresidential construction and reseller customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 1  

1 in july 2017 we reclassified certain end market designations the daily sales growth rates in the above table for all periods through the second quarter of 2017 differ from prior disclosures 

our nonresidential construction and reseller business is heavily influenced by the industrial economy particularly the energy sector the volatility and weakness of energy prices weakened this business particularly beginning in the second quarter of 

2015 and throughout 2016 in 2017 improvements in energy sector metrics including oil prices as well as an improving outlook for industrial capital spending contributed to an improvement in growth for these end markets 

gross profit 

the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 493 in 2017 and 496 in 2016 the gross profit percentage for 2017 declined by 30 basis points due to two elements of mix the first was a change in product and customer mix fasteners are our largest product line and our highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers as a result the decline in our fastener product line to 356 of sales in 2017 from 366 of sales in 2016 contributed to the decline in our gross profit margin this effect was exacerbated by relative growth in the period from sales of our oem fasteners which tend to have a lower gross profit margin than our mro fasteners larger customers for which national accounts are a good proxy whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing also influence the gross profit margin sales to our national account customers increased to 487 in 2017 from 474 of sales in 2016 which contributed to the decline in our gross profit margin the combination of relatively slower growth in our fastener product line and relatively faster growth in sales to our largest customers explains the decline in our overall gross profit margin in 2017 the second element of mix was driven by the acquisition of mansco manscos customer mix is more heavily oriented toward larger customers and its product mix tends to carry a lower gross profit product mix than the companys other products 

during 2016 and 2015 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to the prior year in each year the decrease was primarily caused by changes in product and customer mix 

operating and administrative expenses 

our operating and administrative expenses including a gain on the sale of property and equipment as a percentage of net sales improved to 292 in 2017 from 295 in 2016 the primary contributor to this improvement was relatively modest growth in occupancyrelated expenses though our employeerelated and selling transportation expenses grew more quickly than our occupancy expenses they also contributed to this leverage in 2017 

the growth in employeerelated occupancyrelated and selling transportation expenses the three largest components of our operating and administrative expenses compared to the same periods in the preceding year is outlined in the table below 

employeerelated expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes our employeerelated expenses increased in 2017 this was related to 1 an increase in fulltime equivalent fte headcount related to efforts to support growth in our business 2 higher performance bonuses and commissions due to growth in net sales and net earnings as well as regulatory driven incremental compensation 3 an increase in our profit sharing contribution and option awards 4 increased health care costs and 5 the inclusion of mansco personnel the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was caused by increases in average annual fte headcount and an increase in health care costs which were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth gross profit and operating income both on a dollar basis and on a relative basis the slight increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was caused by increases in fulltime equivalent headcount and growth in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to our expanding growth in operating income offsetting factors included lower performance bonuses and commissions due to the decrease in our gross profit percentage and a focused reduction in overtime hours paid 

the table below summarizes the percentage change in our fte headcount at the end of the periods presented compared to the end of the prior period 



occupancyrelated expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our branches and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our branch operation and classify the depreciation and repair costs as occupancy expense the slight increase in occupancyrelated expenses in 2017 when compared to 2016 was mainly driven by increases in costs related to industrial vending equipment fmi bins and automation equipment at our distribution centers the most significant components of our occupancyrelated expenses facility costs and utility expenses were mostly flat in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to a reduction in our number of public branches the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was mainly driven by an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment and an increase in occupancy expense related to rent the largest impact came from the industrial vending equipment the increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was driven by an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment and an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the previous several years primarily related to automation 

our selling transportation expenses consist primarily of expenses for our branch fleet of vehicles including branch fuel expense as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales selling transportation expenses increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 we increased the size of our fieldbased vehicle fleet for sales personnel which resulted in higher expenses however the larger impact was an increase in fuel expense due to higher fuel prices and consumption during the period this was partially offset by gains on sales of leased vehicles selling transportation expenses increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 this was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and was partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense the contraction in selling transportation expenses in 2015 when compared to 2014 was driven by the decline in fuel costs 

the last several years have seen some variation in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2017 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 89 90 85 and 97 respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2016 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 64 82 83 and 80 respectively the fluctuations were a result of 1 variations in fuel costs 2 the service levels provided to our inmarket locations from our distribution centers 3 the number of vehicles at our branch locations 4 the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of the expansion of our sales force and 5 changes in driving conditions these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our branch delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and branch and other sales centered use 

in 2017 aside from these larger impacts our operating and administrative expenses were also affected by increases in spending on information technology incremental operating expenses including amortization related to our acquisition of mansco and the absence of supplier marketing incentives that existed in the first nine months of 2016 as part of our csp 16 initiative 

net interest expense 

our net interest expense was 87 in 2017 compared to 61 in 2016 and 27 in 2015 the increase in 2017 when compared to 2016 was mainly caused by higher average interest rates and a slightly higher average debt balance during the period the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was driven by higher average interest rates and increased borrowings 

income taxes 

we recorded a provisional income tax expense of 2945 in 2017 or 337 of earnings before income taxes this amount reflects an estimated reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities of 308 as a result of the income tax rate decrease included in the tax act partially offset by an estimated increase in income tax payable in the amount of 65 as a result of the transition tax on cash and cash equivalent balances related to accumulated earnings associated with our international 

operations also included in the tax act absent the impact of the tax act our income tax expense for 2017 would have been approximately 3188 or 365 of earnings before income taxes the decrease in our income tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was also related to changes in our reserve for uncertain tax positions and the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard update asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in the first quarter of 2017 this standard addresses accounting for excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation that were previously recorded in additional paidin capital on the balance sheet and are now recognized in income tax expense on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2017 a more detailed description of the adoption of asu 201609 is included in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 368 and 375 for 2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in our income tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was caused by a slight change in jurisdictional income and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions as our international business and profits grew the past several years the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states lowered our effective tax rate 

we are evaluating the impacts of the tax act on our 2018 provisional income tax expense booking rate we currently estimate this rate will be in the range of 24 to 26 of earnings before income taxes 

net earnings 

net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



1 absent the impact of the tax act our net earnings for 2017 would have been 5542 an increase of 110 when compared to 2016 and our basic and diluted earnings per share would have each been 192 an increase of 112 and 113 respectively 

during 2017 net earnings increased primarily due to stronger sales and operating profits combined with a reduction in income tax expense the slightly higher increase in basic and diluted earnings per share was primarily due to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2017 during 2016 net earnings decreased despite our nominal sales growth primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized and an increase in operating and administrative expenses the contraction of basic and diluted earnings per share was smaller due primarily to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2015 and early 2016 during 2015 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to our net earnings growth the decline in our operating cash flow as a percentage of net earnings largely reflects working capital trends and specifically accounts receivable as further described below in 2016 the slight contraction in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by our current initiative to add additional products into branch inventory under our csp 16 format and an increase in net accounts receivable growth this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in net cash paid for income taxes in 2015 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by growth in net earnings and a decrease in the cash required 

to fund our net working capital which includes accounts receivable and inventory changes this was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes 

operational working capital 

operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories is highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

in 2017 the annual growth in net accounts receivable reflects accelerating growth in sales throughout the course of the year combined with relatively stronger growth of our national accounts and international business growth in accounts receivable continued in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the timing of the christmas and new year holidays affecting the timing of these customers payments currency fluctuations also impacted accounts receivable in 2017 in 2016 the annual growth in net accounts receivables outpaced the growth in sales this was not the case through the third quarter and was mostly a function of conditions in the fourth quarter of 2016 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we collected receivables from our seasonally stronger third quarter but because demand fell off surprisingly sharply in november and december our fourth quarter receivables were unseasonably low in the fourth quarter of 2016 by contrast we collected receivables from our seasonally stronger third quarter but because demand was more closely in line with seasonal norms our receivables in the period were similarly more normal over a longer period of time if we continue to see relatively strong growth in our international business and of our large customer accounts it could continue to create difficulty in managing the growth of accounts receivables relative to the growth in net sales   

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new branch openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at distribution centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 3 expanded direct sourcing 4 expanded fastenal brands 5 expanded industrial vending solutions 6 national accounts and onsite growth 7 international growth and 8 expanded stocking breadth at individual branches related to our csp initiatives all of these items impacted both 2017 and 2016 though new branch openings have taken on a significantly diminished role however in 2017 the most significant contributor to the increase in inventories was improving business activity and the growth of our onsite business in 2016 the most significant contributors to the increase in inventories were the impact of infusing incremental inventory into our network beginning at the end of 2015 as part of our csp 16 initiative the relative growth of international sales the growth of our onsite business and opportunist product purchases at yearend absent the opportunistic product purchases at yearend growth in inventories would have moderated substantially from earlier in the year reflecting the stabilizing of csp 16 inventories 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities were primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below and cash paid for acquisitions in 2017 and 2015 

net capital expenditures purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



note – a reconciliation of net capital expenditures is outlined in the table below 

our net capital expenditures decreased in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to lower spending in 2017 related to 1 the absence of spending on vending equipment that occurred in 2016 related to the leased locker rollout 2 the absence of spending on shelving and signage that occurred in 2016 for the csp 16 initiative and 3 timing associated with the addition of pickup trucks our net capital expenditures increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 which was primarily due to the purchase of industrial vending devices related to the leased locker program we signed in february 2016 and spending on automation in certain distribution centers our net capital expenditures decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 which was largely related to the completion of distribution center automation projects in process during 2014 

property and equipment expenditures in 2017  2016  and 2015  consisted of 1 the purchase of software and hardware for our information processing systems 2 the addition of fleet vehicles 3 the purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to branch openings and our csp 16 initiative 4 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased branch properties 6 purchases related to industrial vending and 7 costs related to enhancements to distribution centers including automation systems equipment disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several branch locations and a distribution center 2015 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2018  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2017  2016  and 2015  net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and net proceeds from debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases 

in 2017 we purchased 1900000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4343 per share in 2016 we purchased 1600000 shares at an average price of approximately 3715 per share and in 2015 we purchased 7100000 shares at an average price of approximately 4126 per share 

dividends 

we declared a quarterly dividend of 037  per share on january 16 2018  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 128   120  and  112  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

debt 

in order to fund the considerable cash needed to purchase industrial vending devices under our leased locker program to expand our industrial vending business to increase the use of automation in our distribution centers to purchase our common stock and pay dividends and to fund the acquisition of mansco on march 31 2017 we have borrowed under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility peaked during each quarter of 2017 and 2016 as follows 



as of december 31 2017 we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 2800  and contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 363  as of december 31 2017  we also had 

loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 1350  descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings 

approximately 920 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we have considered the financial requirements of each foreign subsidiary and our parent company and will continue to reinvest these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us even after taking into consideration the deemed repatriation and transition tax under the tax act the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with investments in foreign subsidiaries is discussed in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation 

throughout 2017 we experienced increasing product cost inflation particularly in our fastener products we were able to take actions during the period including pricing adjustments to mostly offset this inflation in the aggregate the overall impact of inflation and pricing on sales and profits was not material in 2017 during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in our fastener products which was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products in 2015 we experienced some deflation in our fastener products and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates in reaching such decisions we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances historical experience and actuarial valuations actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations our critical accounting estimates include the following 

allowance for doubtful accounts  – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs our methodology for estimating this reserve includes ongoing reviews of the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

inventory obsolescence reserves  – these reserves are based on an analysis of inventory trends including reviews of inventory levels sales information and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product our methodology for estimating these reserves is continually evaluated for factors that could require changes to the reserves including significant changes in product demand market conditions condition of the inventory or liquidation value if business or economic conditions change our estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts 

general insurance reserves  – these reserves are for general claims related to workers compensation property and casualty losses and other general liability selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported related to our historical claim trends we perform ongoing reviews of our insured and uninsured risks and use this information to establish appropriate reserve levels we analyze historical trends claims experience and loss development patterns to ensure the appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made historically actual required reserves have not varied materially from estimated amounts

purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above our purchase orders are based on current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods or services specifying minimum order quantities 

liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these liabilities a discussion of income taxes is contained in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates  – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 

commodity steel pricing  – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners during 2017 we experienced some inflation in overall steel pricing during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in steel pricing this deflation was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year in 2015 we noted some overall deflation in steel pricing we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 

commodity energy prices  – we have market risk for changes in prices of gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity however this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers the efficiency of our trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency 

interest rates   loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates tied to libor as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a one percentage point increase in libor in 2017 would have resulted in approximately 28 of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

under the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as discussed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on march 31 2017 we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of manufacturers supply company ‘mansco’ we have excluded mansco from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 which represented 08 of total assets and 09 of net sales included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 

based on our assessment and those criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  there was no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting

overview 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we opened our first store in 1967 in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 27000 we began with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities over time that mandate has expanded to a broader range of industrial and construction supplies that we break into twelve product lines described later in this document the large majority of our transactions are businesstobusiness though we also have some walkin retail business at the end of 2016 we had 2503  store locations in 21 countries supported by 14 distribution centers in north america eleven in the united states two in canada and one in mexico and we employed 19624  people we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products and services from convenient locations as well as to the high quality of our employees 

the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



the following table provides a summary of the store locations we operated at the end of each year as well as the store openings closings and conversions during each year

6  converted stores are sites converted from stores to nonstore selling locations net of sites converted from nonstore selling locations to stores 

our stores represent the foundation of our service approach putting us close to the customer and providing an efficient means of providing them with a broad range of products and services on a timely basis we believe there are few companies that offer our store coverage on a national basis we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our store network there are times when this leads us to open new locations we select these new locations based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and nonresidential construction we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines and over time our district and store personnel may tailor the inventory offering to the needs of the local customer base in both 2016 and 2015 we opened new stores at a rate of approximately 2 our store network evaluations also reveal locations that are candidates for closure consolidation or conversion as was the case in 2016 and 2015 this resulted in a net decrease in store locations in each of the last two years 

we currently have several versions of selling locations 1 a traditional store services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of the products we offer 2 an overseas store focuses on manufacturing customers and our fastener product line and is the format we typically deploy outside the united states and canada 3 a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large accounts in a market 4 a strategic account site is similar to a strategic account store but typically operates out of an existing store rather than from a unique location 5 an onsite location is a selling unit located in or near a customers facility that sells product solely to that customer because traditional overseas and strategic account stores sell to multiple customers they are included in our total store count neither strategic account sites nor onsite locations are included in our total store count because strategic account sites operate from an existing store location and onsite locations represent a customer subset of an existing store location 

we have long maintained that marketplace demographics could support a north american network of 3500 stores we continue to believe this but since establishing this figure our strategy has changed store openings at least in their historical sense the traditional store are no longer our primary growth driver at this point the emergence of and increased investment in new growth drivers and business models make it unlikely that we will approach the total store potential of north america these new growth drivers include industrial vending onsite locations and end market growth investments csp 16 for example as well as the investment in sales personnel both store and nonstore to support them these represent alternative means to address the requirements of certain customer groups they also get us even closer to our customers than the traditional store which has always been core to fastenal’s strategy and an effective means of providing differentiated and sticky service that is very difficult for large and small competitors to replicate these growth drivers appear to have substantial market opportunities of their own for instance we believe the market could support approximately 17 million industrial vending machines we have also identified over 15000 customer locations with potential to implement the onsite service model we remain committed to a large robust store network it remains the indispensable foundation of our business still our store count peaked in 2013 and has declined in each of the three years since and more often than not going forward it will likely be difficult to know if our total store count will increase or decrease in any given year in contrast we expect to grow our installed base of industrial vending machines and increase our onsite locations meaningfully over time 

we plan to open additional selling locations outside of the united states in the future the selling locations outside of the united states contributed approximately 12 of our consolidated net sales in 2016  with approximately 49 and 30 of this amount attributable to our canadian and mexican operations respectively 

it has been our experience that our profitability is affected by the age of our store base new stores tend to be less profitable due to startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates most of its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires at least ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month to illustrate of the 17 stores opened in the first quarter of 2016 nine were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2016 it has also been our experience that when these new stores mature and increase their sales base their profitability similarly increases 

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2015  to 2016  based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2016  contributed approximately 14900 or approximately 04 of our consolidated net sales in 2016  with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2016  or from our nonstore business included in the average monthly sales amounts are sales from our nonstore selling locations such as our holokrome ® business included in the 2009 group the year it was acquired and our onsite locations onsite locations are considered an extension of the store in which the customer relationship originated therefore we include the average sales of our onsite locations in the year in which the home store opened 



1 we closed 144 and 50 stores in 2016  and 2015  respectively the number of closed stores is noted in the table above as 2016  number 2015  number 

2  we converted 16 and six stores to nonstore selling locations in 2016 and 2015 respectively and converted one nonstore selling location to a store in 2016 the number of net converted stores is noted in the table above as 2016  number 2015  number 

3 the average monthly sales include sales from stores open for less than the full fiscal year 

we introduced our industrial vending offering in 2008 the initiative began to gain significant traction in 2011 and has since been an expanding component of our business from the start we believed vending could be transformative to industrial distribution because it provided our customers the benefits of reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability we also believed we had a ‘first mover’ advantage with the technology and a market advantage by virtue of our extensive store network with approximately 62800 units in the field at the end of 2016 vending is not a new initiative for us however we believe it has proven its effectiveness in strengthening our relationships with customers and helped to streamline the supply chain where it has been utilized we also believe there remains considerable room between our current installed base and the potential installed base of the market as a result we anticipate continued growth in installed units over time 

we operate eleven regional distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us approximately 35 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit deliveries of two to five times per week to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of our selling locations increases we intend to add new distribution centers the distribution centers in indiana and california also serve as a master hub to support the needs of the stores in their geographic region as well as provide a broader selection of products for the stores serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia california north carolina and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems or asrs these nine distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 85 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated we intend to invest in this type of asrs distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our washington and kansas distribution centers 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness distribution center and vending systems are primarily supported from central locations while each selling location uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized purchased and licensed software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the fastenal name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ®  product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then encourage the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  and approximately 33 34 and 36 of our consolidated sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line and more recently portions of our nonfastener product lines are also sold through industrial vending machines the most significant of these is our safety supplies product line which accounted for approximately 15 14 and 13 of our sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories 

during the last several years we have added private label brands we often refer to these as fastenal brands to our offering these private label brands represented approximately 12 12 and 11 of our consolidated net sales in 2016  2015 and 2014 respectively most of these private label products are in the nonfastener product lines 

we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our selling locations from individual selling locations and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and store personnel nonstore selling locations stock inventory based on customerspecific arrangements inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the selling locations served by the respective distribution center inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call inventory redistribution 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2016  approximately 96 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 4 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  and cardinal fasteners ®  product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2016  

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for distribution equipment two main suppliers for our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic location is set forth in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices as well as net sales at our foreign locations could be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance repair and operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2016  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 400000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts each month with purchase activity of at least 250 per month was approximately 106000 

in 2016  no one customer accounted for more than 5 of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions however slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries which can mute the benefit of this protection examples include the collapse of oil and other commodity prices which has had a detrimental impact not only on customers in the oil and gas agriculture and mining industries but also other industries such as heavy equipment manufacturers servicing these customers this impact is compounded if it is a global rather than a regional issue 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local storefronts and selling personnel we support our stores with multichannel marketing including email and online marketing print and radio advertising catalogs promotional flyers events and store signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on nascar ®  sponsorships through our partnership with roush fenway racing ®  in 2016 and 2015 we presented the fastenal ®  brand to millions of sprint cup fans as the primary sponsor of ricky stenhouse jrs no 17 car 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales during the winter months our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather also sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the fourth of july holiday period the thanksgiving holiday period october in canada and november in the united states and the christmas and new year holiday period due to plant shut downs 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include large distributors located primarily in large cities smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores and online retailers we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe the convenience provided to customers by operating selling locations primarily stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage the convenience of a large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending combined with our local storefront provides a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see employees below 

our onsite service model provides us with a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local store the onsite model provides value to our customers through customized service while giving us a competitive advantage through stronger relationships with those customers all with a relatively low investment given the existing store and distribution structure 

employees 

we employ a total of 19624  full and parttime employees most of whom are employed at a store or an onsite location we characterize these personnel as follows 



we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to promote from within for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific education and training programs that are offered to our employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and trade accounts receivable collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers some of whose businesses may entail heightened levels of such risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding the growth drivers of our business  our sales growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores in recent years however we have devoted increased resources to other growth drivers including our industrial vending business which is discussed in more detail below our onsite business and our national accounts team while we have taken steps to build momentum in the growth drivers of our business we cannot assure you those steps will lead to additional sales growth failure to achieve any of our goals regarding industrial vending onsite locations national accounts signings our csp 16 customer service project 2016 initiative or other growth drivers could negatively impact our longterm sales growth 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margins than our fastener products also as noted below our strategy of growing our pretax profit margin by increasing our average annual sales per store has contributed to a drop in our gross profit percentage due to resulting changes in our customer mix if our customer or product mix continues to change our gross profit percentage may decline further downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition reductions in our volume of purchases can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances during 2016 and 2015 our gross profit continued to be adversely impacted by changes in customer and product mix the decrease in 2015 was amplified by a reduction in our customers discretionary spending in the fourth quarter 

our pathwaytoprofit strategy the goal of which is to improve our pretax profit margins by growing the average annual sales of our stores may prove unsuccessful on a longterm basis  in april 2007 we introduced our pathwaytoprofit strategy that strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings and investing the funds saved by opening fewer stores in additional sales and sales leadership personnel under the pathwaytoprofit strategy our goal is to increase our average annual sales per store which would allow us to capture earnings leverage by spreading operating and administrative expenses over higher sales and grow our pretax profit margin our gross profit margin generally decreases as our average per store sales increase as larger stores sell to larger customers whose more focused buying patterns merit more competitive pricing however our operating and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales typically improve as average per store sales grow in most years the net effect is an increase in our pretax profit margin as the relative improvement in operating and administrative expenses offsets the decrease in gross profit margin a downturn in the economy or in the principle markets served by us or difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified sales and sales leadership personnel could adversely impact our ability to continue to grow our average per store sales in addition greater than expected decreases in our gross profit margin resulting from changes in customer mix or other factors noted above or the failure to control operating and administrative expenses to the degree necessary to offset expected decreases in our gross profit margin could adversely impact our pretax profit margin even as average per store sales increase 

our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive  we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local store presence allowing us to service machines more rapidly our vendible 

product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending machines used in and certain software and services needed to operate our industrial vending business while these machines software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers or difficulties transitioning our industrial vending hosting services could be disruptive 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and profit margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our selling locations could impact labor costs sales at existing selling locations and the successful execution of our growth drivers  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores and planned expansion of our other selling channels 

our inability to transition key executive officers may divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations our success depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and we have had some transition in our executive officers over the last few years difficulties in smoothly implementing that transition or of recruiting suitable replacements in the event of unsuccessful transitions could divert the attention of other members of our senior management team from our existing operations 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could cause us to lose market share or erode our operating income  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition from brick and mortar retailers in markets in which we have stores or from online retailers particularly those major internet providers who can offer a wide range of products and rapid delivery and the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our operating income 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their relationship with us if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational interruptions incur substantial additional costs become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation in the marketplace the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of 

data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security were to occur it could interrupt our operations subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and the termination of contracts we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including without limitation import and export requirements antibribery and corruption laws tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries product compliance laws environmental laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions advertising regulations data privacy and cyber security requirements regulations on suppliers regarding the sources of supplies or products labor and employment laws and anticompetition regulations in addition as a supplier to federal state and local government agencies we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to the formation administration and performance of our governmental contracts we are also subject to governmental audits and inquiries in the normal course of business ongoing audit activity and changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties damage to our reputation and in the case of laws and regulations relating specifically to governmental contracts the loss of those contracts 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses in recent years we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

industry and general economic risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those stores and other selling channels 

this risk was demonstrated in 2015 and 2016 we have significant exposure to companies involved in the manufacture of capital goods and heavy equipment in 2015 our business was impacted by lower commodity prices including oil lower corporate capital spending and a strong us dollar these variables resulted in our manufacturing customers making less money and when that happens they tend to cut back on spending which yields a slowdown in our business to those customers these same dynamics carried into 2016 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government 

regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions or trade issues additionally the shipment of goods from foreign countries could be delayed by container shipping companies encountering financial or other difficulties our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier or shipper who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier or shipper providing equally appealing products and services 

new trade policies could make sourcing product from overseas more difficult andor more costly  we source a significant amount of the products we sell from outside of the united states primarily asia this sourcing is both direct through our whollyowned asiabased subsidiary fastco trading co ltd and indirect from vendors that themselves procure product from international sources considerable political uncertainty has arisen in the united states that may result in changes in the trade policies that companies such as fastenal have built their sourcing operations around should this occur it may be difficult in light of 1 the significant structural investments made over time and 2 the absence of significant domestic fastener production for us to adjust our capabilities to the new policies in the short term which could increase the difficulty andor cost of sourcing foreign products such changes could adversely affect our ability to secure sufficient product to service our customers andor adversely affect our cost of operating in a way that hurts our financial results 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales cost of sales gross profit percentage distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit to deteriorate or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our market share gross profit and operating income  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could adversely impact our distribution system and demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

our current estimates of the market potential of our business strategies could be incorrect  our strategies to grow our business include the opening of stores in new and existing markets and the expansion of our industrial vending business and onsite locations we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores and that the potential market opportunity for industrial vending is approximately 17 million machines we have also identified over 15000 customer locations with the potential to implement our onsite service model these estimates are based on our business model today and the introduction or expansion of other business strategies such as online retailing could cause them to change in addition the market potential of a particular business strategy may vary from expectations because of a change in the marketplace such as changes in customer concentration or needs a change in the nature of that business strategy or weaker than anticipated acceptance by customers of that business strategy we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will decide to open stores or expand our industrial vending or onsite service models to reach the full market opportunity in particular while we estimate we have the potential in north america for approximately 

1000 more stores than we have today we have slowed our store openings in recent years and have focused instead on other growth drivers of our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and impact our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing as of december 31 2016  we had 390 million  of outstanding debt obligations including loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility the credit facility of 305 million  and senior unsecured promissory notes issued under our master note agreement the master note agreement in the aggregate principal amount of 75 million  loans under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based on the london interbank offered rate libor and mature on march 1 2018 the notes issued under our master note agreement consist of two series the first is in an aggregate principal amount of 40 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 200 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2021 the second is in an aggregate principal amount of 35 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 245 per annum and is due and payable on july 20 2022 our aggregate borrowing capacity under the credit facility is 700 million our aggregate borrowing capacity under the master note agreement is 200 million however none of the institutional investors party to that agreement are committed to purchase notes thereunder 

during periods of volatility and disruption in the united states credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the credit market turmoil of 2008 and 2009 did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given our low level of indebtedness at that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased our indebtedness has increased significantly since 2009 and we have the capacity under our credit facility and master note agreement to substantially increase borrowings in the future if credit market volatility were to return the cost of servicing our existing debt could increase due to the liborbased interest rate provided for under our credit facility in addition borrowing additional amounts to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs or to refinance our existing indebtedness could be difficult and the cost of doing so could be high

investment risk

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2500  company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance repair and operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

business discussion 

we are a growthcentric organization focused on identifying drivers that will allow us to get closer to our customers and gain market share in what we believe remains a fragmented industrial distribution market our current growth drivers will be discussed throughout this report our growth drivers have evolved and can be expected to continue to evolve over time however what has always been true and what we expect to remain true is the key to the success of any of our growth drivers is our employees and the services they provide to our customers in the field 

the table below summarizes our store employee count and our total employee count at the end of the periods presented later in this document we discuss the average fulltime equivalent fte headcount to help explain the expense trends in more detail the final three items below summarize our investments in industrial vending machines onsite locations and store locations 



1 in february 2016 we signed an agreement to lease a significant number of industrial vending lockers to one of our customers as of december 31 2016 we have deployed approximately 15000 devices under this agreement these devices do not generate product revenue and are excluded from the count noted above 

several items worth noting with respect to our results 

1 during the last twelve months we have reduced our headcount by 995 people in our stores and 1122 people in total these reductions can be primarily attributed to natural attrition rather than an active headcount reduction program we continue to add headcount where necessary to support our growth initiatives notably our onsite business defined as dedicated sales and service provided from within the customers facility however the continued softness of the north american industrial economy has caused us to more intensively scrutinize our full and parttime staffing levels outside of these initiatives indeed after increasing our total headcount every quarter during 2015 it has declined during every quarter of 2016 our current staffing levels approximate those at the end of 2014 

2 we opened 40 and 41 stores in 2016 and 2015 respectively our store network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open stores in 2017 as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network and support our growth drivers 

3 we closed or consolidated 144 stores in 2016 about 90 of these stores were in close proximity to another fastenal store and about 85 had leases expiring within 18 months we closed or consolidated 50 stores in 2015 about 80 of these stores were in close proximity to another fastenal store and about 90 had leases expiring within 18 months the store closings did not have a meaningful impact on sales in either period we intend to continue evaluating markets for closures and consolidations in 2017 as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our store network 

4 we continue to see a very strong pace of national account signings defined as new customer accounts with a multisite contract in 2016 and 2015 we signed 190 and 167 new contracts respectively beyond signings or growth activities we look at the health of our large customer market and by extension our overall market by watching the trends of our top 100 customers which represented approximately 26 of our sales in 2016 for several years beginning in 2011 the typical ratio of growth versus contraction in the sales of our top 100 customers was 31 75 grew and 25 contracted that performance has weakened in recent periods more typically approximating 11 since the fourth quarter of 2015 including the fourth quarter of 2016 when 51 customers grew 33 with growth of 10 or more and 49 customers contracted 31 with contraction of 10 or more 

5 we have continued to expand our onsite business our goal was to sign 200 onsite customer locations in 2016 and we signed 176 130 were operational as of december 31 2016 all of the 80 onsite customer locations we signed in 2015 were operational by the end of the second quarter of 2016 

6 we have converted most of our united states stores approximately 2000 to the csp 16 customer service project 2016 format as of december 31 2016 this merchandising footprint involves expanded inventory placement at our store locations to enhance sameday capabilities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 our inventory of csp 16 items at our stores was 42 million higher than the level at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 including inventory at our distribution centers this value was 46 million higher from the end of the third quarter of 2015 before we began this initiative to the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 our inventory of csp 16 items at our stores increased by 50 million or 54 million when including inventory at our distribution centers 

the following sections contain an overview of the following 

 the most important thing to note before you read this is to remember fastenal is several businesses within itself a fastener distributor 35 to 40 of our business and a nonfastener distributor 60 to 65 of our business within the nonfastener component approximately 25 is distributed through a vending machine 

fastener sales 

first and foremost we are a fastener distributor we have been in this business for almost 50 years we are good at it we have strong capabilities at sourcing and procurement at quality control at logistics and at local customer service each of these capabilities is focused on the customer at the end of the supply chain this business is split about 60 productionconstruction needs and about 40 maintenance needs the former is a great business but it can be cyclical because about 75 of our manufacturing customer base is engaged in some type of heavy manufacturing the sale of production fasteners is also a sticky business in the shortterm as it is expensive and time consuming for our customers to change their supplier relationships while our customers value the capabilities we bring to the table in the last two years this group of customers has seen its growth prospects weaken in fact the daily sales growth of the fastener product line peaked at over 10 in the second half of 2014 the rate of growth decelerated in the first quarter of 2015 began contracting in the third quarter of 2015 and continued to experience contraction throughout 2016 including contraction of 24 in the fourth quarter 

nonfastener sales 

second we have a nonfastener maintenance and supply business we have actively pursued this business in the last 20 to 25 years the capabilities we developed as a fastener distributor described above provide a backbone to growing this ‘newer’ business this backbone has been enhanced in recent years with our added capabilities in industrial vending where we believe we have a structural advantage given our local customer service there is more to industrial vending than the device or the financial resources to deploy we believe the ability to replenish with a local team from an integrated supply chain network ie the team behind the machine is critical to the longterm success of this channel because of these capabilities the nonfastener business remains more resilient however similar to our fastener business growth in our nonfastener business has generally weakened in the last two years in fact the daily sales growth of the nonfastener product line peaked at over 17 in the second half of 2014 before beginning to decelerate in the first quarter of 2015 daily sales of nonfasteners did not contract as fasteners did but did slow to a growth rate of just 12 in the fourth quarter of 2015 daily sales of nonfasteners rebounded in 2016 growing about 5 in each of the first three quarters of the year with 59 growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 

one particular nonfastener product line safety supplies has benefited significantly from our initiatives with industrial vending we introduced the safety supplies product line in 1999 and at 153 of total sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 it represents our second largest product line after fasteners daily sales of our safety supplies product line experienced growth of 

about 27 in the last six months of 2014 declined to about 6 growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 and improved to 93 annual growth in 2016 

please read through the detailed sales and sales trends  section later in this document for additional insight 

our gross profit decreased from 499 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased from 493 in the third quarter of 2016 to 498 in the fourth quarter of 2016  the relationship between sales and gross profit depends on our success within our large account business an area that is still underrepresented in our customer mix larger customers produce a belowcompany average gross profit however they generally leverage our existing network of capabilities which typically allows us to enjoy strong incremental operating income growth this customer mix change large versus small as well as our product mix change from fasteners to nonfasteners over time places sustained pressure on our gross profit we continued to face these headwinds throughout 2016 as the daily sales to our national accounts customers and of our nonfastener products grew approximately two percentage points and three percentage points faster respectively than total company sales growth against this backdrop we believe we did well to hold the gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 relatively stable versus the fourth quarter of 2015 the meaningful sequential increase in our gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 relative to the third quarter of 2016 is not attributable to any single item rather it reflects modest positive contributions from a handful of sources including favorable product mix lower freight costs increased sales of fastenal brands private label and the absence of certain costs related to growth initiatives eg costs related to setting up csp 16 in previous quarters 

our operating income decreased from 194 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and from 200 in the third quarter of 2016 to 193 in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the year our operating and administrative expenses in 2016 have increased primarily as a result of the following 1 an increase in industrial vending equipment 2 an increase in average fte headcount 3 an increase in health care costs 4 an increase in information systems costs and 5 an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel these increases were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions in our profit sharing contribution and in fuel expense our fourth quarter 2016 operating income was relatively stable with the fourth quarter 2015 level as an increase in occupancy expenses as a percentage of sales expansion of our vending devices was mostly offset by a decline in payroll expenses as a percentage of sales reduced headcount the sequential decline in our operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 relative to the third quarter of 2016 is consistent with historical norms and related to the lower sales volume that is typical of the period 

using a quarterly average the fte headcount grew as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the same period in the preceding year 



our signings and installed device count of vending machines were as follows for each period 



in 2016 we executed a strategy of optimizing our vending machines evaluating our devices for utilization throughput and product mix by improving the efficiency of our installed base we were able to remove about 9300 units from service which has the effect of artificially depressing our net installs in 2016 a similar less formal effort existed in 2015 resulting in the removal of about 7700 units these removed units form a pool of readytodeploy machines that should reduce the capital necessary in the short term to continue growing our industrial vending device count while this discrete initiative is substantially complete efforts to incrementally optimize our growing installed base will be continuous 

sales and sales trends 

while reading these items it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is estimated to be in excess of 140 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america 2 no company has a significant portion of this market 3 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive 4 when our customer needs something quickly or unexpectedly our local store is a quick source 5 the cost and time to manage and procure these products is meaningful 6 the cost to move these products many of which are bulky can be significant 7 many customers would prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business and 8 many customers would prefer to utilize various technologies to improve availability and reduce waste 

our motto is growth through customer service ®  this is important given the points noted above we believe in efficient markets – to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customers we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can service our customers at the closest economic point of contact for us this closest economic point of contact is the local store or the customers facility therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles 

the concept of growth is simple  find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind the store to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we do these things every day finally we strive to generate strong profits these profits produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers 

sales growth 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 

net sales and daily sales were as follows 



the increase in net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  came primarily from higher unit sales the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at existing store locations and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the growth drivers of our business discussed throughout this document net sales were also impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services with one exception over the last several years our industrial vending initiative has stimulated faster growth with a subset of our customers the rates of growth in net sales in 2016 and 2015 were hindered by weakness in the industrial production and nonresidential construction industries served by us the added growth in 2014 was largely related to two things – the expansion which began in the latter half of 2013 in the number of our store employees and the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores all in an effort to generate more selling energy within our stores and a stabilization in our oem fastener business 

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2016 group – opened 2006 and earlier 2015 group – opened 2005 and earlier and 2014 group – opened 2004 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2016 group – opened 2011 and earlier 2015 group – opened 2010 and earlier and 2014 group – opened 2009 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business store sites opened as follows 2016 group – opened 2014 and earlier 2015 group – opened 2013 and earlier and 2014 group – opened 2012 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 



note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2016  contributed approximately 14900 or 04 to 2016  net sales stores opened in 2015  contributed approximately 36619 or 09 to 2016  net sales and approximately 8745 or 02 to 2015  net sales the rate of sales growth at store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales growth rates of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales arises from two factors first we believe nonfastener products represent a larger market opportunity than fasteners and that we are relatively underrepresented in this market over time this has led to faster growth in the nonfastener product lines a trend amplified by the growth of our industrial vending program through which we sell primarily nonfastener products we believe this factor will continue to promote a lower mix of fasteners in our total sales over time second a weak industrial production environment such as was experienced in 2015 and 2016 has a disproportionately negative effect on fastener sales relative to nonfastener sales which relates more to plant operations than production this weakness is more cyclical than secular and it is possible that a better economic environment could at least partially mitigate the first factor discussed 

monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes  provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends  that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance  provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales –  during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than two  years –  our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2016  group – opened 2014  and earlier 2015  group – opened 2013  and earlier and 2014  group – opened 2012  and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business during the months noted below the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than five  years –  the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2016  group – opened 2011  and earlier 2015  group – opened 2010  and earlier and 2014  group – opened 2009  and earlier this group which represented about 90 of our total sales in 2016  is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during the months noted below the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

summarizing comments   –  there are three distinct influences to our growth 1 execution 2 currency fluctuations and 

3 economic fluctuations this discussion centers on 2 and 3 

the change in currencies in foreign countries relative to the united states dollar impacted our net sales growth over the last several years during 2016 it lowered our net sales growth by 04 durin g the years 2015 and 2014 it lowered our net sales growth by 12 and 05 respectively 

in the first quarter of 2014 our sales growth was hampered by a weak economy foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the canadian dollar and a severe winter in north america that impacted our customers and our trucking network this was partly offset by favorable holiday timing in march the headwinds from the economy and foreign exchange rates persisted in the second quarter of 2014 and the favorable holiday timing in march reversed in april but the weather effects faded by may and june results were significantly less noisy and sales to customers engaged in heavy machinery manufacturing which represents approximately onefifth of our business improved 

during 2015 our business weakened this initially involved customers tied to the oil and gas sector but grew during the course of the year to include customers across additional industries and in geographic areas not typically associated with the oil and gas sector november and especially december experienced a greater frequency and duration of customer plant shutdowns than is typical of these holidayaffected periods 

during 2016 business activity remained generally weak but stable throughout the year in the first quarter of 2016 we returned to growth with a 35 increase in net sales over the first quarter of 2015 as the impact of seasonal plant shutdowns in the fourth quarter of 2015 subsided the period did include some noise related to changing business day counts for instance there was an extra day in february and march which tends to understate the daily sales growth percentage and one fewer day in january which tends to overstate the daily sales growth percentage there was also one extra business day in the period and the easter holiday shifted into march overall during the first quarter of 2016 daily sales grew 19 there was noise throughout the second quarter of 2016 as well one more day in may one fewer day and the absence of easter in april but daily sales growth nonetheless came in at 16 business conditions looked similar in the third quarter of 2016 with daily sales growth of 18 the fourth quarter of 2016 did show some improvement with daily sales growth of 27 though this more likely reflected an easier comparison than substantive improvement in overall demand for most of the year we saw relative weakness from nonresidential construction and heavy manufacturing customers and in demand for our fastener products speaking to the sustained softness in heavy and general industrial markets business with our largest customers was also relatively weak with sales to our top 100 customers rising modestly in the first half of 2016 and falling modestly in the second half of 2016 while these weaknesses were representative of conditions in the united states and canada total sales outside of these geographic areas were relatively strong and improved over the course of 2016 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in march 2016 in april 2015 and in april 2014 the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week the july 4th and christmasnew year holiday impacts are examples of the latter 

the tables below show the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line in the first table labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2013 excluding 2008 and 2009 we believe this time frame serves to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance we excluded the 2008 to 2009 time frame because it contains an extreme economic event and we dont believe it is representative the 2016 2015 and 2014 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 16delta 15delta and 14delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 

in 2017 we will begin to utilize a more recent time frame a trailing five year average as our new benchmark our business has changed meaningfully over time and we believe a benchmark that places greater emphasis on more recent patterns is likely to better reflect potential conditions in the future for the sake of comparison we have included in this second table a comparison of 2014 2015 and 2016 to the new benchmark 20112015 



1  the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change patterns discussed above including the new benchmark period of 2011  2015 starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business –  the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing a significant subset of which finds its way into the heavy equipment and oil and gas markets the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line 35 to 40 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective daily sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business demonstrated greater relative resilience over the last several years when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our industrial vending program however this business was not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 

our nonresidential construction business is heavily influenced by the industrial economy particularly the energy sector the volatility and weakness of energy prices has weakened this business particularly beginning in the second quarter of 2015 and throughout 2016 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2016  2015  and 2014  starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

growth drivers of our business 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer we believe this growth is enhanced by great people located in close proximity to our customers this allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors cant easily match historically we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace these openings were initially in the united states and expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid 1990s 

for a little perspective we began our business in 1967 with an idea to sell nuts and bolts fasteners through vending machines we soon learned the technology of the 1960s wasnt ready and also learned a lot of products didnt fit so we went to plan b sell to business users with a direct sales force it took us a number of years to work out the bugs but ten years later we began to pick up the pace of store openings after another ten years of expansion we had approximately 50 stores and sales of about 20 million our need for cash to fund our growth was growing as was our desire to allow employee ownership this led us to a public offering in 1987 

in our first ten years of being public 1987 to 1997 we opened stores at an annual rate approaching 30 per year in the next ten years 1997 to 2007 we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 10 to 15 and since 2007 at an annual rate of approximately 1 to 8 we opened 41 stores in 2015 at an annual rate of approximately 2 and 40 stores in 2016 at an annual rate of approximately 2 our store network forms the foundation of our business strategy and we will continue to open stores in 2017 as is deemed necessary to sustain and improve our network and support our growth drivers 

during our almost 50 years of business existence we have constantly evolved to better serve the market as is described in the paragraphs below and have always been willing to challenge our approach in our first 20 to 25 years we closed several store locations because we felt the market was insufficient to operate a profitable fastener only business every one of those locations was subsequently reopened when our business model evolved to serve these markets profitably during the last 20 to 25 years we have enjoyed continued success with our storebased model but we continued to challenge our approach this resulted in our closing approximately 85 stores in the ten years prior to 2014  not because they werent successful but rather because we felt we had a better approach to growth since 2014 we have continued to evaluate opportunities for store closings we use the term closed however we consider them to be consolidated into another location since the vast majority are in close proximity to another store we will continue to evaluate opportunities for store closingsconsolidations in the future 

the following table provides a summary of store closings for each of the last three years and the corresponding analysis period used to measure their profitability 



there is a shortterm cost for closing these stores and since we believe we will maintain the vast majority of the sales associated with these locations and most of the impacted employees have a nearby store from which to operate the cost primarily relates to the future commitments at our leased locations we have recorded the impaired future costs related to these commitments the related expense was not material as these locations have relatively short lease commitments and minimal leasehold improvements 

during the years our expanding footprint has provided us with greater access to more customers and we have continued to diversify our growth drivers this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically in the early 1990s we began to expand our product lines beyond primarily fasteners and we added new product knowledge to our bench the nonfastener products now represent nearly 65 of our sales this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers the next step began in the mid to late 1990s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus this began with our national accounts group in 1995 and over time has expanded to include individuals dedicated to 1 sales related to our internal manufacturing division 2 government sales 3 internet sales 4 construction 5 specific products most recently metalworking and 6 industrial vending another step occurred at our selling locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and onsite locations and at our distribution centers and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately fourteen years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately nine years ago these strategies allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store regional distribution center master stocking hub or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment lower our freight costs and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers during 2013 and 2014 we expanded our storebased inventory offering around select industries with an emphasis on fasteners construction products and safety products 

beginning in the latter half of 2013 we expanded two key employee groups 1 the number of employees working in our stores and 2 the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores to improve the efficiency accuracy and capacity of our distribution centers we made significant investments into distribution automation over the last several years a majority of our facilities are now automated and greater than 85 of our picking occurs at an automated distribution center finally we also added a high frequency distribution center internally known as thub to support vending and other high frequency selling activities during 2015 and 2016 we continued to enhance the technology in our automated distribution centers to sharpen our focus on growing our onsite business and to expand our storebased inventory offering csp 16 this merchandising footprint involves expanded inventory placement at our store locations to enhance sameday delivery capabilities the theme that shines through in all of these changes is a simple one – invest into and support our sales machine – the local store 

over the last several years our industrial vending operation has been an expanding component of our storebased business we believe industrial vending is an important chapter in the fastenal story we also believe it will continue to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a first mover advantage given this we have continued investing aggressively to maximize the advantage 

our expanded industrial vending portfolio consists of 23 different vending devices with the fast 5000 device our helixbased machine think candy machine representing approximately 40 of the installed machines we have learned much about these devices over the last several years and currently the target monthly revenue ranges from under 1000 per device to in excess of 3000 per device the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of machine and 2 machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as 0375 machine equivalent 0375  7502000 

the industrial vending information related to contracts signed during each period was as follows 



the industrial vending information related to installed machines at the end of each period was as follows 



note in february 2016 we signed an agreement to lease a significant number of industrial vending lockers to one of our customers as of december 31 2016 september 30 2016 and june 30 2016 we have deployed approximately 15000 11000 and 3000 devices respectively under this agreement these devices do not generate product revenue and are excluded from the counts noted above 

the following table includes some additional statistics regarding our net sales and daily sales growth 



1 the percentage of total net sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution 

2 the growth in total net sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the same period in the preceding year 

a significant number of our customers utilize a fastenal vending machine indeed the percent of net sales to customers with industrial vending at 461 in the fourth quarter of 2016 is approaching half of our sales base customers utilizing vending have continued to grow faster than our overall business in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2016 daily sales to these customers grew 36 27 24 and 37 respectively however the relative growth of these customers has moderated over the last couple of years as customers taking advantage of the service have grown to be an increasingly significant portion of our total customer base put another way penetration of our customer base with vending solutions has risen to the point where macroeconomic variables that affect the customer increasingly affect machine throughput as well we believe our installed base of machines and our penetration of our customer base will continue to grow and be a catalyst to 

gaining an increasing share of our customer’s mro spending this was evident in 2016 our installed machine base increased 132 and the daily sales growth of product moving through those machines similarly increased at a rate greater than 10 daily sales of our safety product line which is heavily vended increased 93 in 2016 we believe these factors point to our gaining increasing wallet share with our customers through vending 

in addition to the industrial vending operation noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide bin stock programs also known as keep fill programs in the industry to numerous customers this business which relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners has many similar attributes to our industrial vending relationships these attributes include a strong relationship with these customers where we are often their preferred supplier and a higher frequency of business transactions this business is performed without the aid of a vending machine but does make use of the latest scanning technologies scale systems and our fully integrated distribution network to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers in recent years we have begun to refer to this business as fmi fastenal managed inventory 

profit drivers of our business 

as we state several times in this document profit is important to us for a distribution business profit and cash flow go hand in hand cash flow is what funds our growth provides us with shortterm and longterm flexibility and enables us to create value for our customers our employees our suppliers and our shareholders over time we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability we achieve our improvements in relative profitability both by improving our gross profit and by structurally lowering our operating and administrative expenses 

we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through  we refer to this as the pathway to profit the distinction is important the pathway to profit to which we refer is merely the natural per store leverage that occurs as the average net sales per month of a store increases there are two diverging trends that occur as a store grows first the gross profit percentage at a store generally declines and second our operating and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales generally improves the operating and administrative expense improvement starts on day one while the gross profit percentage decline typically occurs when the average sales at a store move above 100 thousand per month fortunately the operating and administrative expense improvements typically far outweigh the gross profit percentage declines 

the best way to appreciate this dynamic is to look at the cost components of our business the cost components of a store include the following 1 cost of sales and 2 operating and administrative expenses the operating and administrative expenses can be further split into listed by relative size 1 people costs base pay incentive pay benefits training and payroll related taxes 2 occupancy costs facility expenses such as rent property taxes repairs and depreciation on owned facilities as well as utility costs equipment expenses and vending machine related expenses excluding leased locker equipment and 3 all other expenses the largest component of the last category is the vehicles needed in each store to support selling activities 

the first component cost of sales is directly related to sales and fluctuations in sales however it is also heavily influenced by product and customer mix as is true for the company as a whole many stores are underrepresented by and seeing superior growth from the nonfastener product category andor the large customer category as these tend to contribute disproportionately to a stores growth and increase in scale we often see a decline in gross profit as the average monthly net sales of a store increase over the longterm and in the absence of offsetting efforts elsewhere in the business which we address below we expect these factors to continue to exert pressure on our gross profit percentage 

the second component operating and administrative expenses does just the opposite it generally improves as a percentage of net sales this is due to the fixed nature of our open for business expenses and the attractive incremental profit margin typically realized in our remaining variable expenses the open for business expenses are the expenses needed to just keep the front door open and they relate to a base staffing level a base facility cost and base vehicle costs these expenses do not generate a profit however they create the opportunity for future sales growth that will generate profits this drives our pathway to profit 



gross profit –  the gross profit percentage during each period was as follows 



important factors that impact our gross profit percentage over the longterm are our mix of store sizes customer sizes products geographic locations end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business given the close proximity of our sales personnel to our customers business we offer a very high service level with our sales which is valued by our customers and improves our gross profit fasteners which is currently our largest single product line at 35 to 40 of sales is our highest gross profit product line given the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for our customers any reduction in the mix of our sales attributable to fasteners and particularly maintenance fasteners may negatively impact gross profit larger customers whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing also influence gross profit stores typically achieve higher average sales disproportionately by growth in the nonfastener product lines and with large customers causing gross profit to decline as average net sales grow one final item of note our fourth quarter has typically been the season with the most challenges surrounding gross profit this relates to the decline in sales in november and december due to the holiday season and due to the seasonal reduction in nonresidential construction business this drop off in sales reduces the utilization of our trucking network which can also slightly reduce our gross profit 

besides the longterm trends noted above periods of inflation or deflation and sudden changes in business volume can cause shortterm fluctuations in our gross profit percentage by effecting product and customer mix freight and sourcing strength that can occur as we leverage buying scale and efficiency sudden changes in business volume can also impact our gross profit percentage over the shortterm by influencing supplier volume allowances our gross profit percentage is also heavily influenced by our storebased compensation programs which are directly linked to sales growth and gross profit and incentivize our employees to improve both 

during 2016 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to 2015 this decrease was primarily caused by changes in product and customer mix our gross profit also decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 for similar reasonsthe sequential increase in our gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 relative to the third quarter of 2016 is a reflection of modest positive contributions from several sources including favorable product mix lower freight costs increased sales of fastenal brands and the absence of certain costs related to our growth initiatives eg costs related to setting up csp 16 in previous quarters 

during 2015 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily driven by changes in product and customer mix our gross profit as a percentage of net sales also decreased in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw a noticeable squeezing of discretionary spending by our customers in november and december of 2015 which produced a noticeable drop in sales of less frequently purchased products this resulted in all of the drop in gross profit when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and substantially all of the change from the fourth quarter of 2014 

during 2014 our gross profit dropped below 51 the drop was primarily driven by changes in product and customer mix and our strong emphasis on growing average store sales 

operating and administrative expenses   these expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from 2015 to 2016 

historically our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately 65 to 70 and occupancy related expenses approximately 15 to 20 the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew contracted as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the same periods in the preceding year 

employee related expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was caused by increases in fulltime equivalent headcount see table below and an increase in health care costs these increases were partially offset by a contraction in our performance bonuses and commissions and in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to lower sales growth gross profit and operating income both on a dollar basis and on a relative basis the slight increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was caused by increases in fulltime equivalent headcount and growth in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to our expanding growth in operating income offsetting factors included lower performance bonuses and commissions due to the decrease in our gross profit percentage and a focused reduction in overtime hours paid 

using a monthly average the fte headcount grew contracted as follows compared to the same period in the preceding years 



occupancy related expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our stores and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment excluding leased locker equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the depreciation repair costs and hosting services as occupancy expense the increase in 2016 when compared to 2015 was mainly driven by 1 an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment discussed earlier in this document and 2 an increase in occupancy expense related to rent the largest impact came from the industrial vending equipment the increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was driven by 1 an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document and 2 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation in 2016 and 2015 the industrial vending component represented approximately 66 and 42 respectively of the increase 

our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 this was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and was partially offset by a decrease in fuel expense the contraction in selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses in 2015 when compared to 2014 was driven by the decline in fuel costs 

the last several years have seen some variation in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2016 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 64 million 82 million 83 million and 80 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2015 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 88 million 91 million 86 million and 78 million respectively the fluctuations were a result of 1 variations in fuel costs 2 the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers 3 the number of vehicles at our store locations 4 the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our nonstore sales force and 5 

changes in driving conditions these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

income taxes   –  income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 368 375 and 372 for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in our income tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was caused by a slight change in jurisdictional income and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions the increase in our income tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was driven by an increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions as our international business and profits grew the past several years the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states have lowered our effective tax rate 

net earnings –  net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2016 net earnings decreased despite our nominal sales growth primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized and an increase in operating and administrative expenses discussed earlier in this document the contraction of basic and diluted earnings per share was smaller due primarily to the purchase of our shares of common stock in 2015 and early 2016 during 2015 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses during 2014 the net earnings increase was less than that of sales primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized   

cash flow impact items 

operational working capital –  operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



in 2016 the annual growth in net accounts receivables outpaced the growth in sales this was not the case through the third quarter and was mostly a function of conditions in the fourth quarter of 2016 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we collected receivables from our seasonally stronger third quarter but because demand fell off surprisingly sharply in november and december our fourth quarter receivables were unseasonably low in the fourth quarter of 2016 by contrast we collected receivables from our seasonally stronger third quarter but because demand was more closely in line with seasonal norms our receivables in the period were similarly more normal over a longer period of time investors should be aware that if we continue to see relatively strong growth in our international business and of our large customer accounts it could create difficulty in managing the growth of accounts receivables relative to the growth in net sales   

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory 

procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at distribution centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 3 expanded direct sourcing 4 expanded fastenal brands 5 expanded industrial vending solutions 6 national accounts and onsite growth 7 international growth and 8 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores related to our csp initiatives all of these items impacted both 2016 and 2015 however throughout 2016 the most significant contributors to the increase in inventories were the impact of infusing incremental inventory into our network beginning at the end of 2015 as part of our csp 16 initiative the relative growth of international sales the growth of our onsite business and opportunist product purchases at yearend absent the opportunistic product purchases at yearend growth in inventories would have moderated substantially from earlier in the year reflecting the stabilizing of csp 16 inventories 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our selling locations versus our distribution center and manufacturing locations was as follows at year end 



new stores open with the standard store model csp 16 which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 60 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began expanding the inventory offering at our existing store locations to the csp 16 format this inventory expansion continued throughout 2016 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to target a ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari of approximately a 301 ratio on december 31 2016 and 2015 we had a ratio of 271 and 281 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities —  net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2016 the slight contraction in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by our current initiative to add additional products into store inventory under our csp 16 format and an increase in net accounts receivable growth this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in net cash paid for income taxes in 2015 the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by growth in net earnings and a decrease in the cash required to fund our net working capital which includes accounts receivable and inventory changes this was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes 

net cash used in investing activities —  net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities were primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below and cash paid for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 

net capital expenditures purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



note a reconciliation of net capital expenditures is outlined in the table below 

our net capital expenditures increased in 2016 this was primarily due to the purchase of industrial vending machines related to the leased locker program we signed in february 2016 and spending on automation in certain distribution centers our net capital expenditures decreased in 2015 which was largely related to the completion of distribution automation projects in process during 2014 

property and equipment expenditures in 2016  2015  and 2014  consisted of 1 the purchase of software and hardware for our information processing systems 2 the addition of certain pickup trucks 3 the purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings and our csp initiative 4 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 the expansion of our distributiontrucking fleet 7 purchases related to industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and construction of a new centralized distribution facility 2014 and 8 costs related to enhancements to distribution centers with existing automation 2016 2015 and 2014 and the expansion of our distribution centers in high point north carolina 2016 and 2015 modesto california 2014 scranton pennsylvania 2014 and kitchener ontario canada 2014 disposals of property and equipment consisted of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks distribution vehicles and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 2016 2015 and 2014 and a distribution center 2015 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2017  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2016  2015  and 2014  net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity 

net cash used in financing activities –  net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and the related tax impact and net borrowings under debt obligations these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



unremitted foreign earnings – approximately 70995 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash we intend to utilize these funds to support our expansion activities outside the us the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with certain undistributed earnings is discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

stock purchases — during 2016 we purchased 1600000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 3715 per share during 2015 we purchased 7100000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4126 per share during 2014 we purchased 1200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4412 per share 

dividends —  we declared a quarterly dividend of 032  per share on january 17 2017  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 120   112  and  100  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

debt — in order to fund the considerable cash needed to purchase industrial vending machines under our leased locker program to expand our industrial vending business to increase the use of automation in our distribution centers and to purchase our common stock and pay dividends we have borrowed increased amounts under our credit facility and our master note agreement in recent periods 

our borrowings under the credit facility peaked during each quarter of 2016 and 2015 as follows 



as of december 31 2016 we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 305000  and contingent obligations from letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 36267  as of december 31 2016  we also had loans outstanding under the master note agreement of 75000  descriptions of our credit facility and master note agreement are contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation —  during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in our fastener products which was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products in 2015 and 

2014 we experienced some deflation in our fastener products and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth 

critical accounting policies – our accounting policies related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these policies are considered critical because they require application of assumptions and judgments based on historical trends and the composition of account balances although we believe our reserves are adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates  – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies historically our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 

commodity steel pricing  – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners during the first half of 2016 we experienced some deflation in steel prices this deflation was largely offset by some inflation in the latter half of the year in 2015 and 2014 we noted some overall deflation in steel pricing we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 

commodity energy prices  – we have market risk for changes in prices of gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity however this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers the efficiency of our trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency 

interest rates   loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates tied to libor as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility a 1 increase in libor in 2016 would have resulted in approximately 39 million of additional interest expense a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend note – information in this section is as of year end unless otherwise noted the year end is typically december 31 2015  unless additional years are included or noted 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we have 2622  store locations the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later in this document 

we employ 20746  people we characterize these personnel as follows 



we sell industrial and construction supplies to endusers typically businesstobusiness and also have some walkin retail business these industrial and construction supplies are grouped into twelve product lines described later in this document 

we operate 14 distribution centers in north america from which we distribute products to our store and onsite locations eleven of these are in the united states two are in canada and one is in mexico 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

we began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population today of approximately 27000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



we operated the following number of store locations 

  



we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction in 2015 2014 and 2013 we opened new stores at a rate of approximately 2 1 and 2 respectively we also closed or consolidated certain stores in 2015 2014 and 2013 which resulted in a net decrease in store locations in the last two years we expect to open 60 to 75 stores in 2016  which is an annual rate of 2 to 3 and to continue to close or consolidate stores as the need arises 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening district and store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the first type of selling location – a fastenal store location – is either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we typically have outside the united states and canada 

in addition to the fastenal store type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and onsite locations a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store count a strategic account site is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store count an onsite location is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer onsite locations are not included in our store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we currently believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate while we believe there is sufficient potential in north america for 3500 total stores or approximately 900 more than today we have slowed our store openings in recent years and instead have increased our investments in other growth drivers such as people both inside and outside our stores industrial vending and endmarket growth investments this allows us to maintain an aggressive offense where competitors are investing for growth and to maintain a steady offense where competitors arent investing  namely store openings fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 



we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 11 of our consolidated net sales in 2015  with approximately 52 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires at least ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the two stores opened in the first quarter of 2015  one was profitable in the fourth quarter of 2015  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2014  to 2015  based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2015  contributed approximately 8745 or approximately 02 of our consolidated net sales in 2015  with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2015  or from our nonstore business 



1 we closed 50 stores and 73 stores in 2015  and 2014  respectively the number of closed stores is noted in the table above as 2015  number 2014  number 

2  we converted six store locations to nonstore selling locations in 2015  we converted two store locations to nonstore selling locations and one nonstore selling location to a store in 2014  the number of converted stores is noted in the table above as 2015  number 2014  number with store locations converted to nonstore locations shown as negative numbers 

 4 the average sales include sales of stores open for less than the full fiscal year 

several years ago we introduced our industrial vending offering and it has been an expanding component of our business we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story and also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution both because of its benefits to our customers such as reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and its benefits to us in that it allows us to strengthen our relationships with our customers and streamline the supply chain we believe we have a first mover advantage in industrial vending and are investing to maximize this advantage 

we operate eleven regional distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us approximately 34 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers the distribution centers in indiana and california also serve as a master hub to support the needs of the stores in their geographic region as well as provide a broader selection of products for the stores serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia california and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems or asrs these eight distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 81 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated construction of an asrs has begun at our north carolina distribution center and we intend to invest in this type of asrs distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our washington and kansas distribution centers 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ® although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ®  product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then encourage the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  and approximately 34 36 and 38 of our consolidated net sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line and more recently portions of our nonfastener product lines are also sold through industrial vending devices 

detailed information about our sales by product line is provided later in this document in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k each product line may contain multiple product categories during the last several years we have added private label brands we often refer to these as fastenal brands to our offering these private label brands represented approximately 12 of our total net sales in 2015  most of these private label products are in the nonfastener product lines 

we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and store personnel inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2015  approximately 95 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 5 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  and cardinal fasteners ®  product lines the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 6 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our inventory purchases in 2015  

beyond inventory we have some concentration of purchasing activity for example we utilize a limited number of suppliers for distribution equipment two main suppliers for our vehicle fleet and primarily one supplier for our industrial vending equipment however we believe there are viable alternatives to each of these if necessary 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic location is set forth in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices as well as sales at our foreign locations could be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance repair and operations the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2015  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 394000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts each month with purchase activity of at least 250 per month was approximately 100000 

in 2015  no one customer accounted for more than 5 of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions however slumps in one industry served by us can rapidly spread to other interrelated industries which can mute the benefit of this protection examples include the collapse of oil and other commodity prices which has had a detrimental impact not only on customers in the oil and gas agriculture and mining industries but also other industries such as heavy equipment manufacturers servicing these customers this impact is compounded if it is a global rather than a regional issue 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local storefronts and selling personnel we support our stores with multichannel marketing including email and online marketing print and radio advertising catalogs promotional flyers events and store signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on nascar ®  sponsorships through our partnership with roush fenway racing ®  in 2015 we presented the fastenal ®  brand to millions of sprint cup fans as the primary sponsor of ricky stenhouse jr’s no 17 car 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales during the winter months our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather also sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the fourth of july holiday period the thanksgiving holiday period october in canada and november in the united states and the christmas and new year holiday period due to plant shutdowns 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include large distributors located primarily in large cities smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores and online retailers we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and the convenience of a large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our industrial vending combined with our local storefront provides a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products 

and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

our onsite service model provides a strategic advantage with our larger customers building on our core business strategy of the local store the onsite model provides customer value through a customized service model while giving us a stronger competitive advantage and customer relationship all with a relatively low investment given the existing store and distribution structure 

employees 

we employ a total of 20746  full and parttime employees most of whom are employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and companyspecific education and training programs that are offered to our employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on critical aspects of our business such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and trade accounts receivable collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

company risks 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events and we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers such as those in the aerospace industry whose businesses entail heightened levels of that type of risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems in addition certain software used by us is licensed from and certain services related to our information systems are provided by third parties who could choose to discontinue their relationship with us if critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected disruptions or failures of or security breaches with respect to our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace in addition compliance with cyber security laws regulations and standards could be difficult and costly and failure to comply could expose us to legal risk   the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems and website a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion interruption of our business cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or in the function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace in addition our handling and use of personal information is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws regulations and standards such as the payment card industry data security standard change from time to time and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and the development of new processes and may be difficult to achieve if we fail to comply with these laws regulations and standards we could be subjected to legal risk 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings and other growth drivers of our business  our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores although that has not been our primary growth driver in recent years we expect to open new stores at the rate of approximately 2 to 3 in 2016 however we cannot assure you that we can open stores at this rate and we may continue to close or consolidate stores as the need arises in recent years we have devoted increased resources to other growth drivers including our industrial vending and onsite businesses and our 

national accounts team we have targeted the signing of 200 additional onsite locations in 2016 while we believe this is achievable with some additional focus from our district managers and our national accounts team this goal is aggressive and we cannot assure you that we can achieve it similarly while we have taken steps to build momentum in our industrial vending business we cannot assure you that those steps will lead to additional growth in that business failure to achieve any of our goals regarding new store openings our industrial vending and onsite businesses or national accounts signings could negatively impact our longterm sales growth 

our ‘pathwaytoprofit’ strategy the goal of which is to improve our pretax profit margins by growing the average annual sales of our stores may prove unsuccessful on a longterm basis  in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathwaytoprofit’ strategy that strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings and investing the funds saved by opening fewer stores in additional sales and sales leadership personnel under the pathwaytoprofit strategy our goal is to increase our average annual sales per store which would allow us to capture earnings leverage by spreading operating and administrative expenses over higher sales and grow our pretax profit margin our gross profit margin generally decreases as our average per store sales increase as larger stores sell to larger customers whose more focused buying patterns merit better pricing however our operating and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales typically improve as average per store sales grow in most years the net effect is an increase in our pretax profit margin as the relative improvement in operating and administrative expenses offsets the decrease in gross profit margin a downturn in the economy or in the principle markets served by us or difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified sales and sales leadership personnel could adversely impact our ability to continue to grow our average per store sales in addition greater than expected decreases in our gross profit margin resulting from changes in customer mix or other factors noted below or the failure to control operating and administrative expenses to the degree necessary to offset expected decreases in our gross profit margin could adversely impact our pretax profit margin even as average per store sales increase the latter was evidenced in 2015 and 2014 when the improvement in our operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was not sufficient to counterbalance the decrease in our gross profit margin due in part to our push to add more personnel and labor hours in our stores 2015 and 2014 and more district and regional leaders to better serve our stores 2014 and in part to rising miscellaneous expenses 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in customer or product mix that have caused our gross profit percentage to deteriorate for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margin than our fastener products also as noted above our strategy of growing our pretax profit margin by increasing our average annual sales per store has contributed to a drop in our gross profit percentage due to resulting changes in our customer mix if our customer or product mix continues to change our gross profit percentage may decline further downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances during 2015 our gross profit continued to be impacted by changes in customer and product mix the latter of which was amplified by a reduction in our customers discretionary spending in the fourth quarter 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and profit margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings and our ability to transition and retain key senior management may impact our business and financial results  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores and planned expansion of our other selling channels any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

our success also depends on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management and we have had some transition in our executive officers over the last couple of years difficulties in smoothly implementing that transition or the loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition from brick and mortar retailers in markets in which we have stores or from online retailers particularly those major internet providers who can offer a wide range of products and rapid delivery and the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our operating income 

our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive  we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local store presence allowing us to service machines more rapidly our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business in addition we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for the vending machines used in and certain software and services needed to operate our industrial vending business while these machines software and services can be obtained from other sources loss of our current suppliers could be disruptive 

we are required to disclose the use of conflict minerals in certain of the products we distribute which imposes costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks the sec has promulgated rules in connection with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules have required and will continue to require due diligence and disclosure efforts there are and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the rules and the source of any conflict minerals used in those products in addition compliance with these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in those products also we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in products through the procedures we have implemented we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier 

we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies  we have completed several acquisitions of businesses including in 2015 our acquisition of certain assets of fasteners inc a regional industrial construction supply distributor with store locations in the states of washington idaho oregon and montana we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including among others a risk of potential loss of key employees of an acquired business and inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition diversion of our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and risks related to the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in our business our industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition any one or more of these factors could cause us to not realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions 

industry and general economic risks 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 12 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores sales through our other selling channels and the level of profitability of those stores and other selling channels 

this risk was demonstrated during recent years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improved has continued to adversely impact our business in a more recent example 2015 saw a collapse in the price of oil when oil companies make less money they also spend less money this cutback had a ripple effect throughout not just the oil and gas industry but also businesses catering to that industry and resulted in a slowdown of our business with customers in those markets 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect  one of our strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores or approximately 900 more stores than we have today this estimate is based on our business model today and market changes such as industrial vending and the internet or other types of ebusiness could cause it to change in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in that market a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will decide to open stores to reach the full market opportunity while we estimate we have the potential in north america for approximately 900 more stores than we have today we have slowed our store openings in recent years and have focused instead on other growth drivers of our business 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales gross profit percentage cost of goods distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries which could cause our sales to those customers to decline this was evidenced in 2015 when our operating results were negatively impacted by a slow down in our business with customers associated with oil exploration production and refinement 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system and adversely impact demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and 2012 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions this risk was felt in the first quarter of 2014 as our sales growth was hampered in january and february due to a severe winter in north america and its negative impact on our customers and our trucking network 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government 

regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions or trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier providing equally appealing products 

our business may be adversely affected by political gridlock in the united states  we primarily operate in the united states during recent years there has been significant fiscal uncertainty in the country the resolution of which has been impeded by political gridlock we believe this has adversely impacted our business and could negatively impact our business in the future  

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or increase the cost of existing or future financing as of december 31 2015  we had loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility of 350000  loans under the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on libor during periods of volatility and disruption in the us credit markets financing may become more costly and more difficult to obtain although the credit market turmoil of several years ago did not have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or borrowing costs given that we had not entered into our current credit facility or started borrowing material amounts until after that time the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt increased if credit market volatility were to return then obtaining additional or replacement financing could be more difficult and the cost of doing so could be higher than under our current facility in addition due to the floating interest rate provided for under our current credit facility the cost of servicing loans under that facility could increase tight credit conditions could limit our ability to finance stock purchases dividends capital expenditures and other liquidity needs on terms acceptable to us for more information relating to borrowing and interest rates see the following sections below liquidity and capital resources under the heading item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

investment risk 

we cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock purchase program  although our board of directors has historically authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and indicated an intention to do so in the future there are no assurances that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or continue to increase dividends at historic rates in addition although our board of directors has authorized share purchase programs and we have purchased shares in 2016 2015  and in prior years through these programs we may discontinue doing so at any time any decision to continue to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock to increase those dividends or to purchase our common stock in the future will be based upon our financial condition and results of operations the price of our common stock credit conditions and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors

business discussion 

we are a growth focused organization and we constantly strive to make investments into the growth drivers of our business these investments typically center on people by adding more people we add to our ability to interact with and to serve our customers from our local store and to back them up in some type of support role in recent years this investment has also centered on more industrial vending devices to serve our customers’ needs on a 24 hours a day 7 days a week basis

first and foremost we are a fastener distributor we have been in this business for almost 50 years we are good at it we have strong capabilities at sourcing and procurement at quality control at logistics and at local customer service each of these capabilities is focused on the customer at the end of the supply chain this business is split about 60 productionconstruction needs and about 40 maintenance needs the former is a great business but it can be cyclical because about 75 of our manufacturing customer base is engaged in some type of heavy manufacturing the sale of production fasteners is also a sticky business in the shortterm as it is expensive and time consuming for our customers to change their supplier relationships while our customer base values the capabilities we bring to the table in the last twelve months this group of customers has seen a contraction in its production and therefore its need for fasteners during this time frame our fastener product line has seen its daily growth decrease from about 10 growth in the last six months of 2014 to about 6 contraction in the fourth quarter of 2015 said another way our market share gains continue to be strong but the contraction from our existing customers plus some price deflation has eliminated our growth and created contraction 

nonfastener sales 

second we have a nonfastener maintenance and supply business we have actively pursued this business in the last 20 to 25 years the capabilities we developed as a fastener distributor described above provide a backbone to growing this ‘newer’ business this backbone has been enhanced in the last five years with our added capabilities in industrial vending given our local customer service we believe we have a structural advantage in the industrial vending business there is more to industrial vending than the device or the financial resources to deploy we believe the ability to replenish with a local team from an integrated supply chain network ie the team behind the machine is critical to the longterm success of this channel because of these capabilities the nonfastener business remains more resilient however similar to our fastener business our nonfastener business has weakened in the last twelve months during this time frame our nonfastener product line has seen its daily sales growth decrease from about 18 growth in the last six months of 2014 to about 1 growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 

please read through the detailed sales and sales trends  section later in this document for additional insight 

our gross profit decreased from 505 in both the fourth quarter of 2014 and third quarter of 2015 to 499 in the fourth quarter of 2015 the relationship between sales and gross profit depends on our success within our large account business an area that is still underrepresented in our customer mix the large account end market produces a below average gross profit however as demonstrated in recent quarters it leverages our existing network of capabilities and allows us to enjoy strong incremental operating income growth this customer mix change large versus smaller as well as our product mix change from fasteners to nonfasteners over time are a constant drain on our gross profit a trend we expect to continue in the future 

however this trend had limited relevance in the fourth quarter of 2015 rather we saw a noticeable squeezing of discretionary spending by our customers in november and december of 2015 see related discussion about 2015 later in summarizing comments which produced a noticeable drop in the sale of less frequently purchased products this resulted in all of the drop in gross profit when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and substantially all of the change from the fourth quarter of 2014 we believe this to be a temporary issue however we don’t know when this drop will subside our gross profit is also impacted by supplier incentives with weaker net sales growth and our tight management of inventory levels the growth of spending with our suppliers is lower hence our supplier incentives are reduced 

in regards to operating expenses we added 2329 people to the fastenal organization in the last twelve months about 81 of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location this provided a meaningful increase in our capacity however we needed to fund this increased capacity we did this by 1 managing our total operating and administrative expenses outside of payroll related costs and 2 managing our hours worked in a very focused site by site fashion our store headcount grew by 136 in the last twelve months but our average fulltime equivalent store headcount only grew by 102 these two items allowed us to invest in store personnel and fund that investment in a weak economic environment below is a quick recap of our fulltime equivalent headcount to supplement the information discussed earlier in this document 



we touched on our industrial vending earlier but here is a quick recap during the fourth quarter of 2015 we signed 4016 devices we signed 4689 devices in the third quarter of 2015 and we signed 4108 devices during the fourth quarter of 2014 our installed device count on december 31 2015 was 55510 an increase of 185 over december 31 2014 and the percent of total net sales to customers with industrial vending was 439 our total daily sales to customers with industrial vending during the fourth quarter of 2015 grew 07 over the fourth quarter of 2014 however daily sales of nonfastener products to customers with vending grew approximately 4 while daily sales of fasteners to customers with vending contracted approximately 8 

finally some thoughts on capital allocation during the latter half of 2014 and throughout 2015 we have been modifying our capital allocation by buying back some common stock one factor influencing our stock buybacks is our external valuation our relative stock valuation has weakened over the last several years which prompted us to reassess our cash deployment to this end we have spent approximately 337 million buying back stock in the last six quarters and have repurchased approximately 27 of our outstanding shares from the start of this time frame we are mindful of our shareholders’ expectations relative to our dividend paying history and have primarily funded this buyback with debt over the last three to four years we had dramatically increased our capital expenditures relative to our net earnings for the rapid deployment of distribution automation and industrial vending over where those expenditures had been in prior years these investments will continue in the future however we expect capital expenditures relative to our net earnings will moderate and will allow us to continue to fund our cash needs for our daytoday business primarily from continuing operations please read through the detailed cash flow impact items  section and the consolidated statements of cash flows later in this document for additional insight 

sales and sales trends 

while reading these items it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is estimated to be in excess of 160 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america 2 no company has a significant portion of this market 3 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive 4 when our customer needs something quickly or unexpectedly our local store is a quick source 5 the cost and time to manage and procure these products is meaningful 6 the cost to move these products many of which are bulky can be significant 7 many customers would prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business and 8 many customers would prefer to utilize various technologies to improve availability and reduce waste 

our motto is growth through customer service ®  this is important given the points noted above we believe in efficient markets – to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customers we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can service our customers at the closest economic point of contact for us this closest economic point of contact is the local store therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles 

the concept of growth is simple  find more customers every day and increase our activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit serviceminded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we have a great team behind the store to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we do these things every day finally we strive to generate strong profits these profits produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers 

sales growth 

note – daily sales are defined as the total net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 

net sales and daily sales were as follows 



the increase in net sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services with one exception over the last several years our industrial vending initiative has stimulated faster growth with a subset of our customers discussed later in this document the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the growth drivers of our business discussed later in this document the rate of growth in net sales in 2015 was hindered by weakness in the industrial production and nonresidential construction industries served by us the added growth in 2014 was largely related to two things – the expansion which began in the latter half of 2013 in the number of our store employees and the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores all in effort to generate more selling energy within our stores and a stabilization in our oem fastener business 

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2015 group – opened 2005 and earlier 2014 group – opened 2004 and earlier and 2013 group – opened 2003 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2015 group – opened 2010 and earlier 2014 group – opened 2009 and earlier and 2013 group – opened 2008 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2015 group – opened 2013 and earlier 2014 group – opened 2012 and earlier and 2013 group – opened 2011 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 



note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2015  contributed approximately 8745 or 02 to 2015  net sales stores opened in 2014  contributed approximately 28028 or 07 to 2015  net sales and approximately 9762 or 03 to 2014  net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales has been driven by the continued success of our nonfastener product lines which we began to add in the 1990s and by the growth of our industrial vending program since we sell primarily nonfastener products in our industrial vending machines this program has led to greater resilience to weak industrial production of our nonfastener business compared to our fastener business 

monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes  provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends  that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance  provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales –  during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than two  years –  our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2015  group – opened 2013  and earlier 2014  group – opened 2012  and earlier and 2013  group – opened 2011  and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business during the months noted below the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than five  years –  the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2015  group – opened 2010  and earlier 2014  group – opened 2009  and earlier and 2013  group – opened 2008  and earlier this group which represented about 90 of our total sales in 2015  is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during the months noted below the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

summarizing comments   –  there are three distinct influences to our growth 1 execution 2 currency fluctuations and 3 economic fluctuations this discussion centers on 2 and 3 

the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar impacted our net sales growth over the last several years during the years 2013 2014 and 2015 it lowered our net sales growth by 02 05 and 12 respectively 

during the first half of 2013 the fastener product line was heavily impacted by our industrial production business these customers utilize our fasteners in the manufactureassembly of their finished products the end markets with the most pronounced weakening included heavy machinery manufacturers with exposure to mining military agriculture and construction the daily sales growth in july 2013 and december 2013 were negatively impacted by the timing of the july 4th holiday thursday in 2013 versus wednesday in 2012 and the christmasnew year holiday wednesday in 2013 versus tuesday in 2012 this resulted in a lone business  day on friday july 5 2013 in which many of our customers were closed and three distinct one to two day work periods in the last two weeks of december 2013 the december 2013 impact was amplified due to poor weather conditions 

our sales to customers engaged in light and medium duty manufacturing largely related to consumer products began to improve late in 2013 and into 2014 this made sense given the trends in the pmi index at that time in the first quarter of 2014 our sales growth was hampered in january and february due to a weak economy and foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the canadian dollar however the biggest impact was a severe winter in north america and its negative impact on our customers and our trucking network in march 2014 the weak economy and negative foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued however the weather normalized and our daily sales growth expanded to 116 this double digit growth in march was helped by the easter timing april in 2014 in the second quarter of 2014 the negative impact of the easter timing was felt and then a less noisy picture emerged in may and june our sales to customers engaged in heavy machinery manufacturing primarily serving the mining military agricultural and construction end markets which represents approximately one fifth of our business had a very weak 2013 but stabilized late in 2013 and improved in 2014 

during 2015 our business weakened as mentioned earlier in this document and in prior quarterly disclosures the weakening initially involved customers tied to the oil and gas sector but grew during the course of the year to include customers across additional industries and in geographic areas not typically associated with the oil and gas sector in november and december one distinct trend emerged involving customer plant shutdowns this is not uncommon during the holiday season however we experienced a greater number and duration of shutdowns than in prior years during both late november and late december with the trend more pronounced in late december 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april 2015 in april 2014 and in march 2013 the second landing centers on july 4th and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week the july 4th and christmasnew year holiday impacts are examples 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2013 excluding 2008 and 2009 we believe this time frame will serve to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance we excluded the 2008 to 2009 time frame because it contains an extreme economic event and we dont believe it is comparable the 2015 2014 and 2013 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 15delta 14delta and 13delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 



1  the january figures represent the percentage change from the previous october whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business –  the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 



as indicated earlier our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and operations the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production  business is to examine the results in our fastener product line just under 40 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers from a company perspective sales growth rates of fasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective sales growth rates of nonfasteners when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business demonstrated greater relative resilience over the last several years when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our strong industrial vending program however this business was not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales growth rates to these customers when compared to the same period in the prior year were as follows 

our nonresidential construction business is heavily influenced by the industrial economy particularly the energy sector the volatility and weakness of energy prices has weakened this business particularly in the last three quarters 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2015  2014  and 2013  starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

growth drivers of our business 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer we believe this growth is enhanced by great people located in close proximity to our customers this allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors cant easily match historically we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace these openings were initially in the united states and expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid 1990s 

for a little perspective we began our business in 1967 with an idea to sell nuts and bolts fasteners through vending machines we soon learned the technology of the 1960s wasnt ready and also learned a lot of products didnt fit so we went to plan b sell to business users with a direct sales force it took us a number of years to work out the bugs but ten years later we began to pick up the pace of store openings after another ten years of expansion we had approximately 50 stores and sales of about 20 million our need for cash to fund our growth was growing as was our desire to allow employee ownership this led us to a public offering in 1987 

in our first ten years of being public 1987 to 1997 we opened stores at an annual rate approaching 30 per year in the next ten years 1997 to 2007 we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 10 to 15 and since 2007 at an annual rate of approximately 1 to 8 we opened 24 stores in 2014 at an annual rate of approximately 1 and 41 stores in 2015 at an annual rate of approximately 2 our preliminary estimate for 2016 is to open 60 to 75 stores which is an annual rate of approximately 2 to 3 

during our almost 50 years of business existence we have constantly evolved to better serve the market as is described in the paragraphs below and have always been willing to challenge our approach in our first 20 to 25 years we closed several store locations because we felt the market was insufficient to operate a profitable fastener only business every one of those locations was subsequently ‘reopened’ when our business model evolved to serve these markets profitably during the last 20 to 25 years we have enjoyed continued success with our storebased model but we continue to challenge our approach this resulted in our closing approximately 85 stores in the ten years prior to 2014  not because they weren’t successful but rather because we felt we had a better approach to growth during 2014 we continued to challenge our approach and closed 73 stores several items we think are noteworthy the group of stores we identified for closure in the second half of 2014 was profitable in the first quarter of 2014 our 2014 analysis measurement period those stores operated with average sales of about 36 thousand per month we chose to close this group because we felt this was simply a better approach to growing our business profitably during 2015 we closed 50 stores similar to 2014 we chose to close this group of stores because we felt this was 

simply a better approach during the third quarter of 2014 our 2015 analysis measurement period 35 of these 50 stores were profitable 

there is a shortterm price for closing these stores and since we believe we will maintain the vast majority of the sales associated with these locations and most of the impacted employees have a nearby store from which to operate the price primarily relates to the future commitments related to the leased locations we have recorded the impaired future costs related to these commitments the related expense was not material as these locations have relatively short lease commitments and minimal leasehold improvements we use the term closed however we consider them to be consolidated into another location since the vast majority are in close proximity to another store 

during the years our expanding footprint has provided us with greater access to more customers and we have continued to diversify our growth drivers this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically and the results of this are reflected in our earlier discussion on sales growth at stores opened greater than five years in the early 1990s we began to expand our product lines beyond primarily fasteners and we added new product knowledge to our bench the nonfastener products now represent about 60 of our sales this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers the next step began in the mid to late 1990s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus this began with our national accounts group in 1995 and over time has expanded to include individuals dedicated to 1 sales related to our internal manufacturing division 2 government sales 3 internet sales 4 construction 5 specific products most recently metalworking and 6 industrial vending another step occurred at our sales locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and onsite locations and at our distribution centers and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately thirteen years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately eight years ago these strategies allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store regional distribution center master stocking hub or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment lower our freight costs and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers during 2013 and 2014 we expanded our storebased inventory offering around select industries with an emphasis on fasteners construction products and safety products and beginning in the latter half of 2013 we expanded two key employee groups 1 the number of employees working in our stores and 2 the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores to improve the efficiency accuracy and capacity of our distribution centers we made significant investments into distribution automation over the last several years a majority of our facilities are now automated and greater than 80 of our picking occurs at an automated distribution center finally we also added a high frequency distribution center internally known as thub to support vending and other high frequency selling activities during 2015 we continued to enhance the technology in our automated distribution centers and sharpened our focus on growing our onsite business in the fourth quarter of 2015 we also began further expansion of our storebased inventory offering csp 16 this merchandising footprint involves expanded inventory placement at our store locations to enhance sameday delivery capabilities the theme that shines through in all these changes is a simple one – invest into and support our sales machine – the local store 

over the last several years our industrial vending operation has been an expanding component of our storebased business we believe industrial vending will be an important chapter in the fastenal story we also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a first mover advantage given this we have been investing aggressively to maximize the advantage 

our expanded industrial vending portfolio consists of 20 different vending devices with the fast 5000 device our helix based machine think candy machine representing approximately 40 of the installed machines we have learned much about these devices over the last several years and currently have target monthly revenue ranging from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 per device the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of machine and 2 ‘machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as ‘0375 machine equivalent’ 0375  7502000 

the industrial vending information related to contracts signed during each period was as follows 



the industrial vending information related to installed machines at the end of each period was as follows 



the following table includes some additional statistics regarding our sales and sales growth 



1 the percentage of total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution 

2 the growth in total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the same period in the preceding year 

our total daily sales growth to customers with industrial vending declined during 2015 which was primarily the result of the slowdown in our business with customers connected to the oil and gas industry including direct industry participants as well as other customers serving those participants to put this into perspective in the third quarter of 2015 daily sales to customers with vending grew 48 over the third quarter of 2014 however daily sales of nonfastener products to customers with vending grew approximately 8 while daily sales of fasteners to customers with vending contracted approximately 3 further in the fourth quarter of 2015 daily sales to customers with vending grew 07 over the fourth quarter of 2014 however daily sales of nonfastener products to customers with vending grew approximately 4 while daily sales of fasteners to customers with vending contracted approximately 8 

in addition to the industrial vending operation noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide bin stock programs also known as ‘keep fill’ programs in the industry to numerous customers this business which relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners has many similar attributes to our industrial vending relationships these attributes include a strong relationship with these customers where we are often their preferred supplier and a frequent level of business transactions this business is performed without the aid of a vending machine but does make use of the latest scanning technologies scale systems and our fully integrated distribution network to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers in recent years we have begun to refer to this business as fmi fastenal managed inventory 

profit drivers of our business 

as we state several times in this document profit is important to us for a distribution business profit and cash flow go hand in hand and this cash flow funds our growth creates value for our customers our employees our suppliers and our shareholders and provides us with shortterm and longterm flexibility over time we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability we achieve our improvements in relative profitability by improving our relative gross profit by structurally lowering our operating and administrative expenses or both 

we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through  we refer to this as the pathway to profit the distinction is important the ‘pathway to profit’ to which we refer is merely the natural ‘per store’ leverage that occurs as the average net sales per month of a store increases there are two diverging trends that occur as a store grows first the gross profit percentage at a store generally declines and second our operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales generally improve the expense improvement starts on day one the gross profit percentage decline typically occurs when the average sales at a store move above 100 thousand per month fortunately the expense improvements typically far outweigh the gross profit percentage declines 

the best way to appreciate this dynamic is to look at the cost components of our business the cost components of a store include the following 1 cost of sales and 2 operating and administrative expenses the operating and administrative expenses can be further split into listed by relative size 1 people costs base pay incentive pay benefits training and payroll related taxes 2 occupancy costs facility expenses such as rent property taxes repairs and depreciation on owned facilities as well as utility costs equipment expenses and vending machine related expenses and 3 ‘all other’ expenses the largest component of the last category is the vehicles needed in each store to support selling activities 

the first component costs of sales is directly related to sales and fluctuations in sales however it is also heavily influenced by product and customer mix because of this influence our gross profit the residual of net sales after deducting the related cost of sales when stated as a percentage of net sales generally declines as the average monthly net sales of a store increases this is due to the mix impact of larger customers 

the second component operating and administrative expenses does just the opposite it generally improves as a percentage of net sales this is due to the fixed nature of our ‘open for business’ expenses and the attractive incremental profit margin typically realized in our remaining variable expenses the ‘open for business’ expenses are the expenses needed to ‘just keep the front door open’ and they relate to a base staffing level a base facility cost and base vehicle costs these expenses do not generate a profit however they create the opportunity for future sales growth that will generate profits this drives our ‘pathway to profit’ 



gross profit –  the gross profit percentage in the first second third and fourth quarters was as follows 



over the last several years our gross profit has fluctuated due to our mix of store sizes customer sizes products geographies end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business we have previously indicated a shortterm expectation for gross profit of around 51 however we would expect this percentage to decline over time as our average store size grows see discussion earlier under profit drivers of our business and below as stated below 

this structural gross profit change centers primarily on customer mix and to a lesser degree product mix however as discussed in the operating and administrative expenses section below we would expect this structural change to improve operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 

ignoring the longterm trend just noted our shortterm gross profit percentages historically fluctuate due to impacts related to 1 transactional gross profit either related to product and customer mix or to freight 2 organizational gross profit sourcing strength that can occur as we leverage buying scale and efficiency and 3 supplier incentive gross profit impacts from supplier volume allowances in the shortterm periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third the transactional gross profit our most meaningful component is heavily influenced by our storebased compensation programs which are directly linked to sales growth and gross profit and incentivize our employees to improve both 

an important aspect of our gross profit relates to our locations our product mix and our customer mix given the close proximity of our sales personnel to our customer’s business we offer a very high service level with our sales which is valued by our customers and improves our gross profit fasteners are our highest gross profit product line given the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for our customers fasteners currently account for approximately 40 of our sales we expect any reduction in the mix of our sales attributable to fasteners to negatively impact gross profit particularly as it relates to maintenance fasteners gross profit is also influenced by average store sales as noted earlier in this document larger stores have larger customers whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing as a result growth in average store sales is expected to negatively impact gross profit a final item of note our fourth quarter has typically been the season with the most challenges surrounding gross profit this relates to the decline in sales in november and december due to the ‘holiday season’ and due to the drop off in nonresidential construction business this drop off in sales reduces the utilization of our trucking network and can slightly reduce our gross profit 

during 2015 our gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased when compared to 2014 this decrease centered on transactional impacts driven by changes in product and customer mix our gross profit as a percentage of net sales also decreased in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw a noticeable squeezing of discretionary spending by our customers in november and december of 2015 which produced a noticeable drop in sales of less frequently purchased products this resulted in all of the drop in gross profit when compared to the third quarter of 2015 and substantially all of the change from the fourth quarter of 2014 

during 2014 our gross profit dropped below 51 the drop generally centered on transactional impacts driven by product and customer mix and our strong emphasis on growing average store sales 

operating and administrative expenses   as a percentage of sales improved from 2014 to 2015 

historically our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately 65 to 70 and occupancy related expenses approximately 15 to 20 the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew or contracted as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the same periods in the preceding year 



employee related expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes the slight increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was caused by increases in fulltime equivalent headcount see table below and growth in our profit sharing contribution primarily due to our expanding growth in operating income offsetting factors included lower performance bonuses and commissions due to the decrease in our gross profit percentage and a focused reduction in overtime hours paid the increase in 2014 when compared to 2013 was driven by 1 an increase in performance bonuses and commissions due to our expanding sales growth from the past year 2 a contraction in profit sharing contribution due to lower relative profitability and 3 an increase in health care costs these factors combined with an increase in fulltime equivalent headcount see table below caused employee related costs to grow 

on average the fulltime equivalent fte headcount grew as follows compared to the same period in the preceding years 



occupancy related expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our stores and distribution locations and 4 industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy the increase in 2015 when compared to 2014 was driven by 1 an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document and 2 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation the increase in 2014 when compared to 2013 was driven by 1 an increase in the amount of industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document 2 an increase in building utility cost due to a severe winter in january and february 2014 and increases in natural gas prices during the 2014 heating season 3 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation and 4 an accrual related to store closings in 2015 and 2014 the industrial vending component represented approximately 42 and 45 respectively of the increase 

our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses contracted in 2015 when compared to 2014 this was driven by the decline in fuel costs see discussion below the growth in selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses in 2014 when compared to 2013 was driven by the increase in store headcount and by a reduction in mileage per gallon associated with severe winter driving conditions 

the last several years have seen some variation in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2015 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 88 million 91 million 86 million and 78 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2014 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 119 million 125 million 115 million and 95 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our nonstore sales force and changes in driving conditions these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

income taxes   –  income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 375 372 and 371 for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in our income tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was driven by an increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and changes in the reserve for uncertain tax positions our income tax rate increased slightly from 2013 to 2014 as our international business and profits grew the past several years the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states have lowered our effective tax rate 

net earnings –  net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2015 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses during 2014 the net earnings increase was less than that of sales primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized   during 2013 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the expansion in the gross profit percent realized and a slightly lower income tax rate 

cash flow impact items 

operational working capital –  operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



the growth in net accounts receivable noted above was comparative to our sales growth in the final two months of the year the strong growth in recent years with our international business and of our large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at distribution centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 3 expanded direct sourcing 4 expanded fastenal brands private label 5 expanded industrial vending solutions 6 national accounts growth 7 international growth and 8 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores while all of these items impacted both 2015 and 2014 items 3 through 8 had the greatest impact 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows at year end 



new stores open with the standard store model csp 16 which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 60 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began expanding the inventory offering at our existing store locations to the csp 16 format 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to target a ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari of approximately a 301 ratio on december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a ratio of 281 

acquisition – on october 31 2015 we acquired certain assets of fasteners inc a regional industrial and construction supply distributor with store locations in the states of washington idaho oregon and montana the business did not have a material impact on our 2015 operating results although the allcash acquisition had some impact on our current assets and cash flow the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall net sales in 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities —  net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



in 2015 the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by growth in net earnings and a decrease in the cash required to fund our net working capital which includes accounts receivable and inventory changes this was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2014 the increase in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net earnings 

net cash used in investing activities —  net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used in investing activities were primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below and cash paid for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014 

net capital expenditures purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



our net capital expenditures decreased in both 2015 and 2014 this was largely related to the completion of distribution automation projects in process during 2014 and 2013 

property and equipment expenditures in 2015  2014  and 2013  consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 purchases related to industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and construction of a new centralized distribution facility 2014 and 2013 and 8 costs related to enhancements to distribution centers with existing automation 2015 2014 and 2013 and the expansion of our distribution centers in high point north carolina 2015 modesto california 2014 scranton pennsylvania 2014 and 2013 kitchener ontario canada 2014 and 2013 akron ohio 2013 atlanta georgia 2013 and indianapolis indiana 2013 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 2015 2014 and 2013 and a distribution center 2015 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2016  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2015  2014  and 2013  net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity because of the considerable cash needed to expand our industrial vending business to increase the use of automation in our distribution centers and to fund purchases of our common stock and dividends we increased our borrowing under our 700000  unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility has an expiration date of march 1 2018  

the borrowings under the credit facility peaked during each quarter as follows 



as of december 31 2015 we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 350000  and undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 36266  

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future payments under operating leases the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 



net cash used in financing activities –  net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations in net cash used in financing activities are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of common stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options and the related tax impact and net borrowings under the credit facility these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



cash commitments – the portion of debt outstanding under our credit facility classified as longterm and the maturity of that debt is described later in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

unremitted foreign earnings – approximately 94000 of cash and cash equivalents are held by nonus subsidiaries these funds may create foreign currency translation gains or losses depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash there are no significant restrictions that would preclude us from bringing the majority of these funds back to the us the income tax impact of repatriating cash associated with certain undistributed earnings is discussed in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

stock purchases — during 2015 we purchased 7100000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4126 per share during 2014 we purchased 1200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4412 per share during 2013 we purchased 200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4540 per share 

dividends —  we declared a quarterly dividend of 030  per share on january 14 2016  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 112   100  and  080  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

line of credit —  a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

effects of inflation —  we experienced some deflation in our fastener products and minimal price movements in our nonfastener products in 2015  and 2014  with the net impact being a slight drag on growth 

critical accounting policies – our accounting policies related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these policies are considered critical because they require application of assumptions and judgments based on historical trends and the composition of account balances although we believe our reserves are adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results 

allowance for doubtful accounts  – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 

inventory reserves  – the reserves are for potentially obsolete or excess inventory and shrinkage the reserves are based on an analysis of inventory trends the analysis includes inventory levels sales information physical inventory counts cycle count adjustments and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 

insurance reserves  – these reserves are for general claims related to workers’ compensation property and casualty losses health claims and other selfinsured losses the reserves are based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

tableend we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity steel pricing commodity energy prices and interest rates changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows 

foreign currency exchange rates  – foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 

commodity steel pricing  – we buy and sell various types of steel products these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners in 2013 2014 and 2015 we noted some deflation in overall steel pricing we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 

commodity energy prices  – we have market risk for changes in prices of gasoline diesel fuel natural gas and electricity however this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers the efficiency of our trucking distribution network and the ability over time to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency 

interest rates   loans under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates tied to libor as a result changes in libor can affect our operating results and liquidity to the extent we do not have effective interest rate swap arrangements in place we have not historically used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rates under our credit facility however due to the relatively small size of our debt we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risk for interest rate exposure under the credit facility a description of our credit facility is contained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

business 

tableend note – information in this section is as of year end unless otherwise noted the year end is typically december 31 2014  unless additional years are included or noted 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we have 2637  store locations the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later in this document 

we employ 18417  people we characterize these personnel as follows 



we sell industrial and construction supplies to endusers typically businesstobusiness and also have some walkin retail business these industrial and construction supplies are grouped into twelve product lines described later in this document 

we operate 14 distribution centers in north america from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations eleven of these are in the united states two are in canada and one is in mexico 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

we began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 27000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



we operated the following number of store locations 

  



we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction in 2014 2013 and 2012 we opened new stores at a rate of approximately 1 2 and 3 respectively we expect to open 20 to 30 stores in 2015  which is an annual rate similar to 2014 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening district and store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the first type of selling location – a fastenal store  location – is either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we typically have outside the united states and canada 

in addition to the fastenal store  type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and ‘inplant’ sites a strategic account store  is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store  count a strategic account site  is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store  count an ‘inplant’ site  is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer ‘inplant’ sites are not included in our store  count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we currently believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate while we believe there is sufficient potential in north america for 3500 total stores or approximately 900 more than today we have slowed our store openings in recent years and instead have increased our investments in other growth drivers such as people both inside and outside our stores fast solutions ®  industrial vending and endmarket growth investments this allows us to maintain an aggressive offense where competitors are investing for growth and to maintain a steady offense where competitors arent investing  namely store openings fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 



we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 11 of our consolidated net sales in 2014  with approximately 56 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the nine stores opened in the first quarter of 2014  four were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2014  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2013  to 2014  based on the age of each store included in the average monthly sales amounts are sales from our nonstore selling locations such as our holokrome ®  business included in the 2009 group the year it was acquired the stores opened in 2014  contributed approximately 9762 or approximately 03 of our consolidated net sales in 2014  with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2014  or from our nonstore business 



 several years ago we introduced our fast solutions ®  industrial vending offering and it has been an expanding component of our business we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story and also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution both because of its benefits to our customers such as reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and its benefits to us in that it allows us to strengthen our relationships with our customers and streamline the supply chain we believe we have a first mover advantage in industrial vending and are investing to maximize this advantage 

we operate eleven regional distribution centers in the united states—minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us approximately 29 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers the distribution centers in indiana and california also serve as a master hub to support the needs of the stores in their geographic region as well as provide a broader selection of products for the stores serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia california and ontario canada distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems or asrs these eight distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 82 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated we intend to invest in this type of asrs distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our washington north carolina and kansas locations 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ® although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ®  product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then encourage the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  and approximately 36 38 and 40 of our consolidated net sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

  



 each product line listed above may contain multiple product categories during the last several years we have added private label brands we often refer to these as exclusive brands to our offering these private label brands represented approximately 11 of our total net sales in 2014 most of these private label products are in the nonfastener product lines 

we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and store personnel inventories in 

distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2014  approximately 95 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 5 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  product line the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2014  

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and longlived assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading ‘item 8 financial statements and supplementary data’ foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2014  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 399000 while our total core accounts defined as the average number of accounts each month with purchase activity of at least 250 per month was approximately 100000 

in 2014  no one customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local storefronts and selling personnel we support our stores with multichannel marketing including email and online marketing catalogs promotional flyers events and store signage in recent years our national advertising has been focused on nascar ®  sponsorships through our partnership with roush fenway racing from 2012 through 2014 fastenal was the primary sponsor of carl edwards’ no 99 car in the sprint cup series and we’ll continue to present the fastenal brand to millions of sprint cup fans as the primary sponsor of ricky stenhouse jr’s no 17 car in 2015 in addition to our nascar ®  sponsorship we do limited print and online advertising through a variety of publications and outlets 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales during the winter months our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather also sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the fourth of july holiday period the thanksgiving holiday period october in canada and november in the united states and the christmas and new year holiday period due to plant shutdowns

our business is highly competitive competitors include large distributors located primarily in large cities smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores and online retailers we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and the convenience of a large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our fast solutions ®  industrial vending combined with our local storefront provides a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions using a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

employees 

we employ a total of 18417  full and parttime employees most of whom are employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to our employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth earnings growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk was demonstrated during the last several years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves could adversely impact our business 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events and we are actively seeking to expand our sales to certain categories of customers such as those in the aerospace industry whose businesses entail heightened levels of that type of risk if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of the company and customer data could be adversely affected disruptions or failures of or security breaches with respect to our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

in the event of a cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace in addition compliance with cyber security laws regulations and standards could be difficult and costly and failure to comply could expose us to legal risk   the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems and website a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we 

develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion interruption of our business cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace in addition our handling and use of personal information is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws regulations and standards such as the payment card industry data security standard change from time to time and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and the development of new processes and may be difficult to achieve if we fail to comply with these laws regulations and standards we could be subjected to legal risk 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect  one of our strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores or approximately 900 more stores than we have today this estimate is based on our business model today and market changes such as industrial vending and the internet or other types of ebusiness could cause it to change in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in that market a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will decide to open stores to reach the full market opportunity while we estimate we have the potential in north america for approximately 900 more stores than we have today we have slowed our store openings in recent years and have focused instead on other growth drivers of our business 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings  our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers and increase our activity with existing customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores although that has not been our primary growth driver in recent years we expect to open new stores at the rate of approximately 1 in 2015 however we cannot assure you that we can open stores at this rate and failure to do so could negatively impact our longterm growth we opened stores at the rate of approximately 1 2 and 3 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

our ‘pathwaytoprofit’ strategy the goal of which is to improve our pretax profit margins by growing the average annual sales of our stores may prove unsuccessful on a longterm basis  in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathwaytoprofit’ strategy that strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings and investing the funds saved by opening fewer stores in additional sales and sales leadership personnel under the pathwaytoprofit strategy our goal is to increase our average annual sales per store which would allow us to capture earnings leverage by spreading operating and administrative expenses over higher sales and grow our pretax profit margin our gross profit margin generally decreases as our average per store sales increase as larger stores sell to larger customers whose more focused buying patterns merit better pricing however our operating and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales typically improve as average per store sales grow in most years the net effect is an increase in our pretax profit margin as the relative improvement in operating and administrative expenses offsets the decrease in gross profit margin a downturn in the economy or in the principle markets served by us or difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified sales and sales leadership personnel could adversely impact our ability to continue to grow our average per store sales in addition greater than expected decreases in our gross profit margin resulting from changes in customer mix or other factors noted below or the failure to control operating and administrative expenses to the degree necessary to offset expected decreases in our gross profit margin could adversely impact our pretax profit margin even as average per store sales increase the latter was evidenced in 2014 when the improvement in our operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was not sufficient to counterbalance the decrease in our gross profit margin due in part to our push to add more personnel and labor hours in our stores and more district and regional leaders to better serve our stores and in part to rising miscellaneous expenses 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in customer or product mix that have caused our gross profit percentage to deteriorate for example the portion of our sales attributable to fasteners has been decreasing in recent years that has adversely affected our gross profit percentage as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit margin than our fastener products also as noted above our strategy of growing our pretax profit margin by increasing our average annual sales per store has contributed to a drop in our gross profit percentage due to resulting changes in our customer mix if our customer or product mix continues to change our gross profit percentage may decline further downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline we can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressure from customers to 

reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations  we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores on a profitable basis in new markets 

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results  while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and profit margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and profit margins 

changes in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our net sales gross profit percentage cost of goods distribution expenses and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating income  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our suppliers these suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased supplier prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful particularly if supplier prices or fuel costs rise rapidly failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating income while increases in the cost of fuel or raw materials could be damaging to us decreases in those costs particularly if severe could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries such as oil exploration production and refinement companies which could cause our sales to those customers to decline 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system and adversely impact demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and 2012 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions this risk was felt in the first quarter of 2014 as our sales growth was hampered in january and february due to a severe winter in north america and its negative impact on our customers and our trucking network 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could impact our ability to 

procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition from brick and mortar retailers in markets in which we have stores or from online retailers particularly those major internet providers who can offer a wide range of products and rapid delivery and the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our operating income 

products manufactured in foreign countries may cease to be available which could adversely affect our inventory levels and operating results  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions or trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier providing equally appealing products 

our business may be adversely affected by political gridlock in the united states  we primarily operate in the united states during the last several years there has been significant fiscal uncertainty in the country the resolution of which has been impeded by political gridlock we believe this has adversely impacted our business and could negatively impact our business in the future  

our fast solutions ®  industrial vending business is relatively new and our competitive advantage could be eliminated  we believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software our local store presence allowing us to service machines more rapidly our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own such competition could negatively impact our ability to expand our industrial vending business or negatively impact the economics of that business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross profit and operating income furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

we are required to disclose the use of conflict minerals in certain of the products we distribute which imposes costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks the sec has promulgated rules in connection with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these rules have required and will continue to require due diligence and disclosure efforts there are and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the rules and the source of any conflict minerals used in those products in addition compliance with these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in those products also we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in products through the procedures we have implemented we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2700 company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing 

sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads oil exploration production and refinement companies mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

business discussion 

the following pages contain a marketplace overview and a general sales growth and product line mix discussion for each of the last three years this is followed by a more in depth discussion of the following 

 while reading these items it is helpful to appreciate several aspects of our marketplace 1 its big the north american marketplace for industrial supplies is estimated to be in excess of 160 billion per year and we have expanded beyond north america 2 no company has a significant portion of this market 3 many of the products we sell are individually inexpensive 4 when our customer needs something quickly or unexpectedly our local store is a quick source 5 the cost and time to manage and procure the products we sell is meaningful 6 the cost to move these products many of which are bulky can be significant 7 many customers would prefer to reduce their number of suppliers to simplify their business and 8 many customers would prefer to utilize various technologies to improve availability and reduce waste 

our motto is growth through customer service ®  this is important given the points noted above we believe in efficient markets – to us this means we can grow our market share if we provide the greatest value to our customers we believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can service our customers at the closest economic point of contact for us this closest economic point of contact is the local store therefore our focus centers on understanding our customers day their opportunities and their obstacles 

the concept of growth is simple find more customers every day and increase your activity with them however execution is hard work first we recruit service minded individuals to support our customers and their business second we operate in a decentralized fashion to help identify the greatest value for our customers third we build a great machine behind the store to operate efficiently and to help identify new business solutions fourth we do these things every day finally we strive to generate strong profits these profits produce the cash flow necessary to fund our growth and to support the needs of our customers 

sales growth 

net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 



the increase in net sales in both 2014 and 2013 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services with one exception over the last several years our fast solutions ®  industrial vending initiative has stimulated faster growth with a subset of our customers discussed later in this document the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the growth drivers of our business discussed later in this document the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 05 and 02 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the added growth in 2014 was largely related to two things – the expansion which began in the latter half of 2013 in the number of our store employees and the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores all in an effort to generate more selling energy within our stores and a stabilization in our oem fastener business 

the increase in net sales in 2012  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new 

products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions ®  industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was hindered by weakness in the industrial production and nonresidential construction industries served by our company the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 01 in 2012  

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2014 group – opened 2004 and earlier 2013 group – opened 2003 and earlier and 2012 group – opened 2002 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2014 group – opened 2009 and earlier 2013 group – opened 2008 and earlier and 2012 group – opened 2007 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2014 group – opened 2012 and earlier 2013 group – opened 2011 and earlier and 2012 group – opened 2010 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 



note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2014  contributed approximately 9762 or 03 to 2014  net sales stores opened in 2013  contributed approximately 52033 or 14 to 2014  net sales and approximately 18620 or 06 to 2013  net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales has been driven by the continued success of our nonfastener product lines which we began to add in the 1990s and by the growth of our fast solutions ®  industrial vending program since we sell primarily nonfastener products in our industrial vending machines this program has led to greater resilience to weak industrial production of our nonfastener business compared to our fastener business 

monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes  provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends  that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month and also looking at the cumulative change from an earlier benchmark month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance  provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales –  during the months noted below all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than two  years –  our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2014  group – opened 2012  and earlier 2013  group – opened 2011  and earlier and 2012  group – opened 2010  and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business during the months noted below the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than five  years –  the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2014  group – opened 2009  and earlier 2013  group – opened 2008  and earlier and 2012  group – opened 2007  and earlier this group which represented about 90 of our total sales in 2014  is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during the months noted below the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the same month in the preceding year 

summarizing comments   –  there are three distinct influences to our growth 1 execution 2 currency fluctuations and 3 economic fluctuations this discussion centers on 2 and 3 

the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar impacted our growth over the last several years during the years 2014 2013 and 2012 it lowered our growth by 05 02 and 01 respectively 

during 2012 the growth in the first three and a half months generally continued the relative strength we saw in 2011 then we began to experience several distinct economic slowdowns the first occurred in the late aprilmay time frame and then moderated until september 2012 the second occurred in the octobernovember time frame this was exaggerated by the impact of hurricane sandy and an unusual business day comparison in october 23 days in 2012 versus 21 days in 2011  the maintenance portion of our business is often linked to monthly spend patterns of our customers which are not as business day dependent this can dilute the daily growth picture given the change in business day divisor the third occurred in the spring of 2013 this involved our fastener product line and our construction business primarily nonresidential construction this third slowdown similar to the first two listed mirrored or slightly led some softening in the pmi index the pmi index is a composite index of economic activity in the united states manufacturing sector it is published by the institute for supply management and is available at httpwwwismws  the fastener piece was heavily impacted by our industrial production business these customers utilize our fasteners in the manufactureassembly of their finished products the end markets with the most pronounced weakening included heavy machinery manufacturers with exposure to mining military agriculture and construction the fourth and fifth occurred in july 2013 and december 2013 the daily sales growth in july 2013 and december 2013 were negatively impacted by the timing of the july 4 th  holiday thursday in 2013 wednesday in 2012 monday in 2011 and the christmasnew year holiday wednesday in 2013 tuesday in 2012 and sunday in 2011 this resulted in a lone business  day on friday july 5 2013 in which many of our customers were closed and three distinct one to two day work periods in the last two weeks of december 2013 the december 2013 impact was amplified due to poor weather conditions 

our daily sales growth trends have generally improved since september 2013 this was largely related to changing comparisons to the prior year and to the improving sequential patterns noted in the next discussion our sales to customers engaged in light and medium duty manufacturing largely related to consumer products have improved since late 2013 this makes sense given the trends in the pmi index since that time 

in the first quarter of 2014 our sales growth was hampered in january and february due to a weak economy and foreign exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the canadian dollar however the biggest impact was a severe winter in north america and its negative impact on our customers and our trucking network in march 2014 the weak economy and negative foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued however the weather normalized and our daily sales growth expanded to 116 this double digit growth in march was helped by the easter timing april in 2014 but the real story is good people good execution and minimal negative weather impacts since march 2014 our double digit growth has continued in the second quarter of 2014 the negative impact of the easter timing was felt and then a less noisy picture emerged in may and june our sales to customers engaged in heavy machinery manufacturing primarily serving the mining military agricultural and 

construction end markets which represents approximately one fifth of our business had a very weak 2013 but stabilized late in 2013 and has improved in 2014 since may 2014 our stores opened greater than five years have enjoyed double digit growth in every month this is a strong indicator of the strength of the marketplace 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april 2014  march 2013  and april 2012  – in 2015 easter will occur in april the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmasnew year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week the july 4 th  and christmasnew year holiday impacts are examples 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled benchmark is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2013 excluding 2008 and 2009 we believe this time frame will serve to show the historical pattern and could serve as a benchmark for current performance we excluded the 2008 to 2009 time frame because it contains an extreme economic event and we dont believe it is comparable the 2014 2013 and 2012 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 14delta 13delta and 12delta lines indicate the difference between the benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 



 a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business –  the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales to these customers grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and is sometimes referred to as oem  original equipment manufacturing and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing and is sometimes referred to as mro  maintenance repair and other the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production  business is to examine the results in our fastener product line approximately 40 of our business which is heavily influenced by changes in our business with heavy equipment manufacturers discussed earlier in this document from a company perspective sales of fasteners grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective sales of nonfasteners grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business demonstrated greater relative resilience over the last several years when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our strong fast solutions ®  industrial vending program this is discussed in greater detail later in this document however this business was not immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales to these customers grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows 

we believe the weakness in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 throughout 2013 and during early 2014 particularly in the nonresidential construction market was amplified by global economic uncertainty combined with economic policy uncertainty in the united states this weakness was amplified by severe winter weather conditions in january and february 2014 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2014  2013  and 2012  starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

nonresidential construction 

growth drivers of our business 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer we believe this growth is enhanced by great people located in close proximity to our customers this allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors cant easily match historically we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace these openings began in the united states and expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid 1990s 

for a little perspective we began our business in 1967 with an idea to sell nuts and bolts fasteners through vending machines we soon learned the technology of the 1960s wasnt ready and also learned a lot of products didnt fit so we went to plan b sell to business users with a direct sales force it took us a number of years to work out the bugs but ten years later we began to pick up the pace of store openings after another ten years of expansion we had approximately 50 stores and sales of about 

20 million our need for cash to fund our growth was growing as was our desire to allow employee ownership this led us to a public offering in 1987 

in our first ten years of being public 1987 to 1997 we opened stores at an annual rate approaching 30 per year in the next ten years 1997 to 2007 we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 10 to 15 and since 2007 we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 1 to 8 we opened 24 stores in 2014 an annual rate of approximately 1 and currently expect to open approximately 20 to 30 stores in 2015 an annual rate similar to 2014 

during our almost 50 years of business existence we have constantly evolved to better serve the market as is described in the paragraphs below and have always been willing to challenge our approach in our first 20 to 25 years we closed several store locations because we felt the market was insufficient to operate a profitable fastener only business every one of those locations was subsequently ‘reopened’ when our business model evolved to serve these markets profitably during the last 20 to 25 years we have enjoyed continued success with our storebased model and we continue to challenge our approach based on this approach we have closed approximately 85 stores in the last ten years  not because they weren’t successful but rather because we felt we had a better approach to growth in the first six months of 2014 we continued to challenge our approach and closed about 20 stores all but four of these locations were in close proximity to another fastenal store in the second quarter of 2014 we took a hard look at our business and identified another 45 stores to close in the second half of 2014 all but eight of these locations were in close proximity to another fastenal store during the second half of 2014 we identified some additional stores for closure and closed 52 stores in total several items we think are noteworthy the group of stores we identified for closure in the second half of 2014 was profitable in the first quarter of 2014 our analysis measurement period those stores operated with average sales of about 36 thousand per month we chose to close this group because we felt this was simply a better approach to growing our business profitably 

there is a shortterm price for closing these stores and since we believe we will maintain the vast majority of the sales associated with these locations and since most of the impacted employees have a nearby store from which to operate the price primarily relates to the future commitments related to the leased locations during the second quarter of 2014 we recorded the impaired future costs related to these commitments the expense was not material as these locations have relatively short lease commitments and minimal leasehold improvements we use the term closed however we consider them to be consolidated into another location since the vast majority are in close proximity to another store 

during the years our expanding footprint has provided us with greater access to more customers and we have continued to diversify our growth drivers this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically and the results of this are reflected in our earlier discussion on sales growth at stores opened greater than five years in the early 1990s we began to expand our product lines beyond primarily fasteners and we added new product knowledge to our bench the nonfastener products now represent about 60 of our sales this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers the next step began in the mid to late 1990s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus this began with our national accounts group in 1995 and over time has expanded to include individuals dedicated to 1 sales related to our internal manufacturing division 2 government sales 3 internet sales 4 construction 5 specific products most recently metalworking and 6 fast solutions ®  industrial vending another step occurred at our sales locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and inplant locations and at our distribution centers and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately twelve years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately seven years ago these strategies allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store regional distribution center master stocking hub or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment lower our freight costs and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers during 2013 and 2014 we expanded our store based inventory offering around select industries with an emphasis on fasteners construction products and safety products and beginning in the latter half of 2013 we expanded two key employee groups 1 the number of employees working in our stores and 2 the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores to improve the efficiency accuracy and capacity of our distribution centers we made significant investments into distribution automation over the last several years a majority of our facilities are now automated and greater than 80 of our picking occurs at an automated distribution center finally our high frequency distribution center internally known as thub is now operational to support vending and other high frequency selling activities the theme that shines through in all these changes is a simple one – invest into and support our sales machine – the local store 

over the last several years our fast solutions ®  industrial vending operation has been an expanding component of our storebased business we believe industrial vending will be an important chapter in the fastenal story we also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a first mover advantage given this we have been investing to maximize the advantage 

our expanded industrial vending portfolio consists of 19 different vending devices with the fast 5000 device our helix based machine think candy machine representing approximately 40 of the installed machines we have learned much about these devices over the last several years and currently have target monthly revenue ranging from under 1000 to in excess of 3000 

per device the following two tables provide two views of our data 1 actual device count regardless of the type of machine and 2 ‘machine equivalent count based on the weighted target monthly revenue of each device compared to the fast 5000 device which has a 2000 monthly revenue target for example the 12door locker with target monthly revenue of 750 would be counted as ‘0375 machine equivalent’ 0375  7502000 

the industrial vending information related to contracts signed during each period was as follows 



the industrial vending information related to installed machines at the end of each period was as follows 



the following table includes some additional statistics regarding our sales and sales growth 



1 the percentage of total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution 

2 the growth in total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the same period in the preceding year 

in addition to the industrial vending operation noted above which primarily relates to our nonfastener business we also provide bin stock programs also known as ‘keep fill’ programs in the industry to numerous customers with respect to our fastener business this business which relates to both our maintenance customers mro fasteners and nonfasteners and original equipment manufacturers oem fasteners has many similar attributes to our industrial vending relationships these attributes include a strong relationship with these customers where we are often their preferred supplier and a frequent level of business transactions this business is performed without the aid of a vending machine but does make use of the latest 

scanning technologies scale systems and our fully integrated distribution network to manage the supply chain for all sizes of customers in recent years we have begun to refer to this business as fmi fastenal managed inventory 

profit drivers of our business 

as we state several times in this document profit is important to us for a distribution business profit and cash flow go hand in hand and this cash flow funds our growth and creates value for our customers our employees our suppliers and our shareholders we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through – we refer to this as the pathway to profit the distinction is important 

we achieve improvements in our relative profitability by improving our gross profit by structurally lowering our operating expenses or both measured as a percentage of sales the gross profit component generally decreases as the average monthly sales increase this is due to the mix impact of larger customers however typically the operating expense component improves more as the average monthly sales increase which paves our pathway to profit in most years we advance on this pathway to profit by increasing our average store size measured in terms of monthly sales and by allowing the changing store mix to improve our profits this is best explained by comparing the varying profitability of our traditional stores in the table below the average store size for the group and the average age number of stores and pretax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter  of the last three years were as follows 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference and dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

we originally announced the pathway to profit in 2007 and discussed the profit improvement we envisioned as the average store size grows today the five groups of stores listed above represent about 80 of our sales with the remaining 20 coming from our strategic accountoverseas stores our dedicated inplant business where we set up a business at a customers site our direct import business and our direct manufacturing business 

store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount –  the table that follows highlights certain impacts on our business of the pathway to profit since its introduction in 2007 under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during 2007 and 2008 however the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008 in the table that follows we refer to our store net sales locations and personnel when we discuss store net sales locations and personnel we are referring to 1 fastenal stores and 2 strategic account stores fastenal stores are either a traditional store the typical format in the united states or canada or an overseas store which is the typical format outside the united states and canada this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this document strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market the sales outside of our store group relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holokrome ®  business acquired in december 2009 or 3 our direct import business 

the breakdown of our net sales the average monthly sales per store the number of stores at quarter end the average headcount at our stores during a quarter the average fte headcount during a quarter and the percentage change for each were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit and for each of the last five quarters 





1  the manufacturing headcount was impacted by the addition of 92 employees with the acquisition of holokrome ®  in december 2009 



gross profit –  the gross profit percentage in the first second third and fourth quarters was as follows 



we believe a normal gross profit percentage for our business is around 51 and constantly strive to operate in a range of 51 to 52 see also the discussion under the caption ‘business update’ earlier in this document this is based on our current mix of store sizes products geographies end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business 

historically our gross profit percentages fluctuate due to impacts related to 1 transactional gross profit either related to product and customer mix or to freight 2 organizational gross profit sourcing strength that can occur as we leverage buying scale and efficiency and 3 supplier incentive gross profit impacts from supplier volume allowances in the shortterm periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third the transactional gross profit our most meaningful component is heavily influenced by our storebased compensation programs which are directly linked to sales growth and gross profit and incentivize our employees to improve both 

an important aspect of our gross profit relates to our locations our product mix and our customer mix given the close proximity of our sales personnel to our customer’s business we offer a very high service level with our sales which is valued by our customers and improves our gross profit fasteners are our highest gross profit product line given the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for our customers fasteners currently account for approximately 40 of our sales we expect any reduction in the mix of our sales attributable to fasteners to negatively impact gross profit particularly as it relates to maintenance fasteners gross profit is also influenced by average store sales as noted earlier in this document larger stores have larger customers whose more focused buying patterns allow us to offer them better pricing as a result growth in average store sales is expected to negatively impact gross profit a final item of note our fourth quarter has typically been the season with the most challenges surrounding gross profit this relates to the decline in sales in november and december due to the ‘holiday season’ and due to the drop off in nonresidential construction business this drop off in sales reduces the utilization of our trucking network and can slightly reduce our gross profit 

during the year and fourth quarter of 2014 our gross profit dropped below 51 the drop generally centered on transactional impacts driven by product and customer mix our strong emphasis on growing average store sales and with respect to the fourth quarter on the seasonality described above 

operating and administrative expenses   as a percentage of sales improved nominally from 2013 to 2014 

historically our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately 65 to 70 and occupancy related expenses approximately 15 to 20 the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the same periods in the preceding year 



employee related expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes for 2014 when compared to 2013 1 our performance bonuses and commissions grew due to our expanding sales growth from the past year 2 our profit sharing contribution contracted due to lower relative profitability and 3 our health care costs grew these factors combined with an increase in fulltime equivalent headcount see table below caused employee related costs to grow for 2013 when compared to 2012 performance bonuses were down other than those related to our vending business however this decrease was offset by increases related to the following factors 1 increases in fulltime equivalent headcount 2 sales commissions grew due to static gross profit combined with sales growth 3 our industrial vending bonuses grew in the first quarter and the twelve month period although they contracted in the second third and fourth quarters due to a change in the pace of the vending rollout 4 our profit sharing contribution grew and 5 our health care costs grew 

on average the fulltime equivalent headcount grew as follows compared to the same period in the preceding years 



occupancy related expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our stores and distribution locations and 4 fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy the increase in 2014 when compared to 2013 was driven by 1 an increase in the amount of fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document 2 an increase in building utility cost due to a severe winter in january and february 2014 and increases in natural gas prices during the 2014 heating season 3 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation and 4 an accrual related to store closings the increase in 2013 when compared to 2012 was driven by 1 a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document 2 an increase in building utility costs 3 a nominal increase in the number of store locations and 4 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years in 2014 and 2013 the industrial vending component represented approximately 45 and 60 respectively of the increase 

our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in the cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses grew in 2014 when compared to 2013 this was driven by the increase in store headcount and the reduction in mileage per gallon associated with severe winter driving conditions selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses were essentially flat in 2013 when compared to 2012 this was helped by stronger sales patterns related to our used store truck fleet which lowered our relative vehicle ownership costs 

the last several years have seen some variation in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline –  during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2014 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 119 125 115 and 95 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2013 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 106 106 112 

and 96 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our nonstore sales force and changes in driving conditions these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

income taxes   –  income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 372 and 371 for 2014  and 2013  respectively our income tax rate increased slightly from 2013 to 2014 however as our international business and profits grow over time the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states have generally begun to lower our effective tax rate 

net earnings –  net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2014 the net earnings increase was less than that of sales primarily due to the reduction in the gross profit percent realized   during 2013 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the expansion in the gross profit percent realized and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2012 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate 

operational working capital –  operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



the growth in accounts receivable noted above was driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period the strong growth in recent years with our international business and of our large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 3 expanded direct sourcing 4 expanded exclusive brands private label 5 expanded industrial vending 

solutions 6 national accounts growth 7 international growth and 8 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores while all of these items impacted both 2014 and 2013 items 3 through 8 had the greatest impact 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to target a ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari of approximately a 301 ratio on december 31 2014 and 2013 we had a ratio of 281 

acquisition 

on october 1 2014 we acquired certain assets of avtech industries inc a wholesale distributor of aerospace fasteners electronic components and miscellaneous aircraft parts the business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2014 financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the allcash acquisition as noted in our consolidated statements of cash flows the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall net sales in 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities —  net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the increases in the net cash provided in each of the three years was primarily due to increases in earnings 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows at year end 



new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 50 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities —  net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used was primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below the 2012 figure was partially offset by the liquidation of marketable securities late in the year to help fund our supplemental dividend payment 

net property and equipment expenditures  purchases of property and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the net capital expenditures increased from 2012 to 2013 and then decreased in 2014 the increase in 2013 was primarily caused by the dramatic increase in the number of fast solutions ®  industrial vending machines deployed in our business and by the expanded use of automation within our distribution centers the decrease in 2014 was largely related to the completion of distribution automation projects in 2013 

property and equipment expenditures in 2014  2013  and 2012  consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 purchases related to fast solutions ®  industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and the construction of a new centralized distribution facility 2014 and 2013 and 8 costs related to the expansion of our distribution centers in winona minnesota 2012 akron ohio 2013 atlanta georgia 2013 scranton pennsylvania 2014 and 2013 kitchener ontario canada 2014 and 2013 modesto california 2014 and indianapolis indiana 2013 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2015  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2014  2013  and 2012 net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity because of the considerable cash needed to expand our fast solutions ®  industrial vending business to increase the use of automation in our distribution centers and to fund the large dividend payout late in 2012 we established a 125000 unsecured credit facility in december 2012 in 2014 we increased the total size of the credit facility in order to help fund our expansion plans and additional purchases of our common stock the total commitment of the lenders to make loans and issue letters of credit under the credit facility is currently 230000 we also increased the size of the letter of credit subfacility to 45000 and extended the maturity date of the credit facility to december 2016 during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2014 our borrowings under the credit facility peeked at 85000 115000 160000 and 155000 respectively at year end we had loans outstanding under the credit facility of 90000 and undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in an aggregate face amount of 37315 

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future payments under operating leases the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 



net cash used in financing activities –  net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise and related tax impact of stock options and net borrowings under the credit facility these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases — during 2014 we purchased 1200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4412 per share during 2013 we purchased 200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4540 per share we did not purchase any stock in 2012 on january 14 2015 our board of directors increased the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased to 2000000 shares 

dividends —  we declared a dividend of 028 per share on january 14 2015  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 100   080  and  124  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

line of credit —  a description of our credit facility is contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the description of our credit facility in note 10 is incorporated herein by reference 

effects of inflation—  in total we experienced minimal price changes in 2014  and 2013  at the product level we experienced some deflation in our fastener products and limited to slight inflation in our nonfastener products in 2014 and 2013 

critical accounting policies—  our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts  – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded although we believe our reserve is adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results 

inventory reserves  – the reserves are for potentially obsolete or excess inventory and shrinkage the reserves are based on an analysis of inventory trends the analysis includes inventory levels sales information physical inventory counts cycle count adjustments and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded although we believe our reserves are adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results 

health insurance reserve  – this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded although we believe our reserve is adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results 

general insurance reserve  – this reserve is for general claims related to workers’ compensation property and casualty losses and other selfinsured losses the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded although we believe our reserve is adequate the results could be materially different if our assumptions and historical trends do not reflect actual results 

tax strategies  – our effective income tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish income tax reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves  – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded

business 

tableend note – information in this section is as of year end unless otherwise noted the year end is typically december 31 2013 unless additional years are included or noted 

fastenal company together with our subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we have 2687  store locations the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later in this document 

we employ 17277  people we characterize these personnel as follows 



we sell industrial and construction supplies to endusers typically businesstobusiness and also have some walkin retail business these industrial and construction supplies are grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document 

we operate 14 distribution centers in north america from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations eleven of these are in the united states two are in canada and one is in mexico 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

we began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 27000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



we operated the following number of store locations 

  



we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction in 2013 2012 and 2011 we opened new stores at a rate of approximately 2 3 and 5 respectively we expect to open 50 to 70 stores in 2014  or a rate of approximately 2 to 3 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening store and district personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the first type of selling location – a fastenal store  location – is either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we have outside of north america 

in addition to the fastenal store  type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and ‘inplant’ sites a strategic account store  is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store  count a strategic account site  is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store  count an ‘inplant’ site  is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer ‘inplant’ sites are not included in the store  count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we currently believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 



we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 11 of our consolidated net sales in 2013  with approximately 61 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month although this time frame has been longer in the current economic environment of the eleven stores opened in the first quarter of 2013  two were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2013  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2012  to 2013  based on the age of each store included in the average monthly sales amounts are sales from our nonstore selling locations such as our holokrome ®  business included in the 2009 group the year it was acquired the stores opened in 2013  contributed approximately 18620 or approximately 06 of our consolidated net sales in 2013  with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2013  or from our nonstore business 



 several years ago we introduced our fast solutions ®  industrial vending offering and it has been a rapidly expanding component of our business we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story and also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution both because of its benefits to our customers such as reduced consumption reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and its benefits to us in that it allows us to strengthen our relationships with our customers and streamline the supply chain we believe we have a first mover advantage in industrial vending and are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage 

we operate eleven regional distribution centers in the united states—minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 27 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers the distribution centers in indiana and california also serve as a master hub to support the needs of the stores in their geographic region as well as provide a broader selection of products for the stores serviced by the other distribution centers 

we currently operate our georgia indiana ohio minnesota and texas distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems or asrs these five distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency and currently handle approximately 66 of our picking activity the indiana facility also contains our centralized replenishment facility for a portion of our industrial vending business this operation is also highly automated we intend to invest in this type of asrs distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our california kansas north carolina pennsylvania and ontario canada locations 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ®  product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then encourage the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  and approximately 38 40 and 42 of our consolidated net sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

  



 each product line listed above may contain multiple product categories during the last several years we have added private label brands we often refer to these as exclusive brands to our offering these private label brands represent approximately 10 of total sales most of these private label products are in the nonfastener product lines 

we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by the district and store managers inventories in 

distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2013  approximately 95 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards or to customer specific requirements the remaining 5 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome ®  product line the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2013  

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading ‘item 8 financial statements and supplementary data’ foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2013  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 405000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2013  no one customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns that are not across multiple industries and geographic regions 

direct marketing continues to be the backbone of our business through our local storefronts and selling personnel we support our stores with multichannel marketing including email marketing catalogs promotional flyers events online and store signage our national advertising has been focused on nascar ®  sponsorships over the past few years including sponsoring no 99 driver carl edwards in the sprint cup series since 2012 along with the nascar ®  sponsorship we do limited print advertising across a variety of industry publications and delta sky  magazine 

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales during the winter months our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather also sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the fourth of july holiday period the thanksgiving holiday period october in canada and november in the united states and the christmas and new year holiday period due to plant shutdowns 

c ompetition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small 

medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and the convenience of a large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our fast solutions ®  industrial vending combined with our local storefront provides a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions in a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

employees 

we employ a total of 17277  full and parttime employees most of whom are employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy or in the principal markets served by us and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or in the principal markets served by us or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk was demonstrated during the last several years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves could adversely impact our business 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of the company and customer data could be adversely affected disruptions or failures of or security breaches with respect to our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

we work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems and website in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace   the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems and website a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we 

develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion interruption of our business cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect  one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in that market a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings  our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores we expect to open new stores at the rate of approximately 2 to 3 in 2014 however we cannot assure you that we can open stores at this rate and failure to do so could negatively impact our longterm growth we opened stores at the rate of approximately 2 3 and 5 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

our current business strategy pathwaytoprofit which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add sales personnel at a faster rate while successful over the last several years has not yet proven successful on a longterm basis in april 2007 we introduced our pathway to profit strategy this strategy initially involved slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax earnings at the time we introduced this strategy we believed that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we could grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pretax earnings as a percent of net sales from 18 to 23 the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2 to 5 and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that were growing because of this economic setback we previously indicated that the time required to achieve our pretax earnings percentage goals for pathway to profit could be delayed 24 to 30 months more recently we have indicated we believe we could hit our pretax earnings percentage goal with less than the 125 thousand per month figure we now believe the pretax earnings goal might be accomplished with average store sales as low as 100 to 110 thousand per month due to the structural lowering of our costs a more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected the prospect of future economic deterioration changes in the rate of new store openings difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel an inability to realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve desired pretax earnings results 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in customer or product mix that have caused gross profit to deteriorate for example the growth of our national accounts since the mid1990’s and of our nonfastener product line since the early 1990’s has adversely affected gross profit as national accounts have the leverage to negotiate lower prices and as our nonfastener products generally carry lower gross profit than our fastener products if our customer or product mix continues to change there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross profit downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could also cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate or decline gross profit can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressures from customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 and the latter half of 2013 can adversely impact gross profit by reducing supplier volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations  we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in 

new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results  while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system and adversely impact demand for our products  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and 2012 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors may include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations over which we have no control  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our suppliers could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or our suppliers control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions or trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with another supplier providing equally appealing products 

our business may be adversely affected by political gridlock in the united states  we primarily operate in the united states during the last several years there has been significant fiscal uncertainty in the country the resolution of which has been impeded by political gridlock we believe this has adversely impacted our business and could negatively impact our business in the future  

our fast solutions ®  industrial vending business is new and our competitive advantage could be eliminated  we believe we have a competitive advantage due to our industrial vending platform hardware and software our local store presence our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our rapidly expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own these alternative solutions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business andor negatively impact the economics of the industrial vending business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers or as competitors with new business models are willing and able to operate with lower gross profit on select products customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our current gross and operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share 

we will need to begin disclosing our use of conflict minerals in certain of the products we distribute which will impose costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks the sec has promulgated final rules in connection with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these new rules have required and will continue to require due diligence efforts with initial disclosure requirements becoming effective in may 2014 there are and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the new rules and the source of any conflict minerals used in those products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in those products also we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in products through the procedures we may implement we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2700 company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

like most industrial and constructioncentric organizations we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years the third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices between 40 and 50 of our sales consist of some type of fastener – nuts bolts screws etc – most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout much of 2009 this inflation turned to deflation when the swings are dramatic this can hurt our gross profit because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices this hurt our gross profit in 2009 the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation the deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross profit to recover in 2010 and 2011 see later discussion on gross profit 

the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2013  this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year however we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales change sequential trend and end market information that follows – that information explains the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 

over the last several years we have continued to make significant investments in 1 store locations 2 national accounts 3 government sales 4 internal manufacturing capabilities 5 international operations over 10 of our sales 6 fast solutions ®  industrial vending 7 product expansion with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands 8 additional sales specialists to support safety products metalworking products and our manufacturing operations 9 additional sales operational support to focus on under performing stores and under performing industrial vending and 10 in the case of 2013 additional region and district leadership and additional store personnel we are excited about the prospects of each 

as always the ‘pathway to profit’ is the cornerstone of our business evolution and it influences everything we do remember our business centers on our 2700 stores – their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time as always we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service ®  

sales growth 

net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 



t he increase in net sales in 2013 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by slight inflationary price changes in our nonfastener products and some price deflation in our fastener products with the net impact being a slight drag on growth our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services with one exception over the last several years our fast solutions ®  industrial vending initiative has stimulated faster growth with a subset of our customers discussed later in this document the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the growth drivers 

of our business discussed later in this document the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 02 in 2013 

the increase in net sales in 2012  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions ®  industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was hindered by weakness in the industrial production and nonresidential construction industries served by our company the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 01 in 2012  

the increase in net sales in 2011  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions ®  industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by the moderating impacts of the previous recessionary environment the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 07 in 2011  

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2013 group – opened 2003 and earlier 2012 group – opened 2002 and earlier and 2011 group – opened 2001 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2013 group – opened 2008 and earlier 2012 group – opened 2007 and earlier and 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2013 group – opened 2011 and earlier 2012 group – opened 2010 and earlier and 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 



note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2013  contributed approximately 18620 or 06 to 2013  net sales stores opened in 2012  contributed approximately 60626 or 18 to 2013  net sales and approximately 24859 or 08 to 2012  net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



the decrease in our fastener sales as a percentage of total sales has been driven by the continued success of our nonfastener product lines which we began to add in the 1990s and by the growth of our fast solutions® industrial vending program this program has lead to greater resilience to weak industrial production of our nonfastener business compared to our fastener business 

monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

note – daily sales are defined as the net sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes  provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends  that is comparing a month to the immediately preceding month in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance  provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales –  during the months in 2013 2012 and 2011 all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than two  years –  our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2013 group – opened 2011 and earlier 2012 group – opened 2010 and earlier and 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business during the months in 2013 2012 and 2011 the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

stores opened greater than five  years –  the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2013 group – opened 2008 and earlier 2012 group – opened 2007 and earlier and 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier this group which represented about 88 of our total sales in 2013 is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during the months in 2013 2012 and 2011 the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

summarizing comments   –  there are three distinct influences to our growth 1 execution 2 currency fluctuations and 3 economic fluctuations this discussion centers on 2 and 3 

the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar impacted our growth over the last several years during 2011 it lifted our growth by 07 in 2012 it lowered our growth by 01 and in 2013 it lowered our growth by 02 

regarding economic fluctuations in 2011 we enjoyed strong growth this reflected the strengthening economic environment being experienced by our customers while the strength did not apply to all customers and to all geographies we serve it was strong enough to produce acceptable results during 2012 the growth in the first three and a half months generally continued the relative strength we saw in 2011 then we began to experience several distinct economic slowdowns the first occurred in the late aprilmay time frame and then moderated until september 2012 the second occurred in the octobernovember time frame this was exaggerated by the impact of hurricane sandy and an unusual business day comparison in october 23 days in 2012 versus 21 days in 2011  the maintenance portion of our business is often linked to monthly spend patterns of our customers which are not as business day dependent this can dilute the daily growth picture given the change in business day divisor the third occurred in the spring of 2013 this involved our fastener product line and our construction business primarily nonresidential construction this third slowdown similar to the first two listed mirrored or slightly led some softening in the pmi index discussed later in this document the fastener piece was heavily impacted by our oem original 

equipment manufacturing customers these customers utilize our fasteners in the manufactureassembly of their finished products the end markets with the most pronounced weakening included heavy machinery manufacturers with exposure to mining military agriculture and construction the construction piece in 2013 was also hampered by poor weather during the winter and spring time frame throughout many areas in north america the fourth and fifth occurred in july 2013 and december 2013 the daily sales growth in july 2013 and december 2013 were negatively impacted by the timing of the july 4th holiday thursday in 2013 wednesday in 2012 monday in 2011 and the christmasnew year holiday wednesday in 2013 tuesday in 2012 and sunday in 2011 this resulted in a lone business  day on friday july 5 2013 in which many of our customers were closed and three distinct one to two day work periods in the last two weeks of december 2013 the december impact was amplified due to poor weather conditions 

our daily sales growth trends have improved since september 2013 this was largely related to changing comparisons to 2012 our sales to customers engaged in light and medium duty manufacturing largely related to consumer products are improving this makes sense given the trends in the pmi index however our sales to customers engaged in heavy machinery manufacturing primarily serving the mining military agricultural and construction end markets which represents approximately one fifth of our business continued to experience weak performance in the fourth quarter of 2013 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in march in 2013 and in april in 2012 and 2011 the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmasnew year holiday the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week the july 4th and christmasnew year holiday impacts noted earlier in this document are examples 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled old benchmark is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003 we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics a weaker industrial economy in north america and could serve as a benchmark for current performance the 2013 2012 and 2011 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 13delta 12delta and 11delta lines indicate the difference between the old benchmark and the actual results in the respective year 

beginning in 2014 we intend to utilize a new benchmark the new benchmark labeled new benchmark in the table below is a historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2013 excluding 2008 and 2009 similar to the old benchmark we believe this updated benchmark will serve to show the historical pattern we excluded the 2008 to 2009 time frame because it contains an extreme economic event and we dont believe it is comparable

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business –  the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales to these customers grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line from a company perspective sales of fasteners grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



as was noted earlier in this document our sales to customers engaged in heavy machinery manufacturing primarily serving the mining military agricultural and construction end markets which represents approximately one fifth of our business and a larger piece of our fastener business continued to experience weak performance this began in 2012 and intensified in 2013 

by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines from a company perspective sales of nonfasteners grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows note this information includes all  end markets 



the nonfastener business has demonstrated greater relative resilience when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our strong fast solutions ®  industrial vending program this is discussed in greater detail later in this document however this business has not been immune to the impact of a weak industrial environment 

the patterns related to the industrial production business as noted above are influenced by the movements noted in the purchasing manufacturers index pmi published by the institute for supply management httpwwwismws which is a composite index of economic activity in the united states manufacturing sector the pmi in 2013 2012 and 2011 was as follows 



for background to readers not familiar with the pmi index it is a monthly indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector in the united states five major indicators that influence the pmi index are new orders inventory levels production supplier deliveries and the employment environment when a pmi of 50 or higher is reported this indicates expansion in the manufacturing industry compared to the previous month if the pmi is below 50 this represents a contraction in the manufacturing sector the pmi is not perfectly correlated with our business as it reflects the activity of certain categories of manufacturers such as those engaged in light and medium manufacturing who historically have not accounted for a significant portion of our sales note  the institute for supply management made annual adjustments to reflect seasonal factors to the pmi index effective with the january 2013 report this table represents the updated pmi index 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales to these customers grew when compared to the same period in the prior year as follows 

we believe the weakness in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 and throughout 2013 particularly in the nonresidential construction market was amplified by global economic uncertainty combined with economic policy uncertainty in the united states and poor weather conditions 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2013 2012 and 2011 starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

growth drivers of our business 

we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer we believe this growth is enhanced by our close proximity to our customers which allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors cant easily match historically we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace these openings were initially in the united states but expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid 1990s 

for a little perspective we began our business in 1967 with an idea to sell nuts and bolts fasteners through vending machines we soon learned the technology of the 1960s wasnt ready and also learned a lot of products didnt fit so we went to plan b sell to business users with a direct sales force it took us a number of years to work out the bugs but ten years later we began to pick up the pace of store openings after another ten years of expansion we had approximately 50 stores and sales of about 20 million our need for cash was growing as was our desire to allow employee ownership this led us to a public offering in 1987 

in our first ten years of being public 1987 to 1997 we opened stores at an annual rate approaching 30 per year in the next ten years 1997 to 2007 we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 10 to 15 and since 2007 at an annual rate of approximately 2 to 8 we opened 53 stores in 2013 or an annual rate of approximately 20 and currently expect to open approximately 50 to 70 stores or an annual rate of approximately 19 to 26 in 2014 

as we gained proximity to more customers we continued to diversify our growth drivers this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically and the results of this are reflected in our earlier discussion on sales growth at stores opened greater than five years in the early 1990s we began to expand our product lines and we added new product knowledge to our bench the nonfastener products now represent over 50 of our sales this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers the next step began in the mid to late 1990s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus this began with our national accounts group in 1995 and over time has expanded to include individuals dedicated to 1 sales related to our internal manufacturing division 2 government sales 3 internet sales 4 specific products most recently metalworking and 5 fast solutions ®  industrial vending another step occurred at our sales locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and inplant locations and at our distribution centers and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately ten years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately five years ago these strategies allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store regional distribution center master stocking hub or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment lower our freight costs and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers during 2013 we expanded our store based inventory offering around select industries with an emphasis on fasteners construction products and safety products and in the latter half of 2013 we expanded two key employee groups 1 the number of employees working in our stores and 2 the number of district and regional leaders supporting our stores the theme that shines through in all these changes particularly the last several is a simple one – invest into and support our sales machine – the local store 

our fast solutions ®  industrial vending operation is a rapidly expanding component of our business   we believe industrial vending will be an important chapter in the fastenal story we also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a first mover advantage we are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage at our investor day in may 2011 we discussed our progress with industrial vending in addition to our discussion regarding progress we discussed our goals with the rollout of the industrial vending machines one of the goals we identified related to our rate of machine signings the first category below – our goal was simple sign 2500 machines per quarter or an annualized run rate of 10000 machines in 2012 we crushed this goal and surpassed the 10000 signings benchmark in july our 2012 momentum continued as we finished the year with more than 20000 machine signings in 2013 we signed more than 19000 machines we consciously slowed the pace in the second quarter of 2013 to promote a quality of install mentality into our rapid approach we think this was a good decision and will continue our aggressive push with fast solutions ® industrial vending in july 2013 we began the process of optimizing our installed vending machines this optimization centered on two aspects 1 the product mix in each machine to maximize customer savings by promoting frequently consumed items and 2 the brand mix in each machine to streamline replenishment the latter centers on our vending catalog 

the following table includes some statistics regarding our industrial vending business 



 note  the fleet of machines we utilize to vend product has expanded over the last several years and currently includes helix vending machines lockers and other formats the helix machine and lockers three door twelve door and eighteen door represent the majority of our installed machines our total installed machine count was 40775 at the end of 2013 however given the lower revenue potential of the three and twelve door locker machines we report an equivalent machine count where each of these locker machines is counted as a half of a machine for example the 33920 noted in the table above and the goals indicated earlier in this document we intend to refine the reporting of all machine equivalencies as we move through 2014 to better reflect the varying revenue potential to our installed vending machines 

profit drivers of our business 

as we state several times in this document profit is important to us for a distribution business it is linked to cash flow and cash flow funds our growth and creates value for our customers our employees our suppliers and our shareholders we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through – we refer to this as the pathway to profit the distinction is important 

we achieve improvements in our relative profitability by increasing our gross profit by structurally lowering our operating expenses or both we advance on the pathway to profit by increasing the average store size measured in terms of monthly sales and by allowing the changing store mix to improve our profits this is best explained by comparing the varying profitability of our traditional stores in the table below the average store size for the group and the average age number of stores and pretax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively were as follows 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

when we originally announced the pathway to profit strategy in 2007 our goal was to increase our pretax earnings as a percentage of sales from 18 to 23 this goal was to be accomplished by slowly moving the mix from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 these groups represented 765 of our store base in the first three months of 2007 the last quarter before we announced the pathway to profit to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 these groups represented 566 of our store base in the fourth quarter of 2013 and by increasing the average store sales from 71600 in the first three months of 2007 to approximately 125000 per month the weak economic environment in 2009 caused our average store size to decrease and consequently lowered our level of profitability however we never lost sight of the simple economic math of our business and our ability to grow the level of profitability longterm in the aftermath of 2009 we grew the average store size we improved our gross profit and we structurally lowered our operating expenses the improvement in the latter two allowed us to amplify the pathway to profit and effectively lowered the average store size required to hit our 23 goal today we believe we can accomplish our pathway to profit goal with average store sales of approximately 100000 to 110000 per month 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount –  the table that follows highlights certain impacts on our business of the pathway to profit since its introduction in 2007 under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during 2007 and 2008 however the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008 in the table that follows we refer to our store net sales locations and personnel when we discuss store net sales locations and personnel we are referring to 1 fastenal stores and 2 strategic account stores fastenal stores are either a traditional store the typical format in the united states or canada or an overseas store which is the typical format outside the united states and canada this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this report strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market the sales outside of our store group relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holokrome ®  business acquired in december 2009 or 3 our direct import business 

the breakdown of our sales the average monthly sales per store the number of stores at quarter end the average headcount at our stores during a quarter the average fte headcount during a quarter and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit for the third quarter of 2008 our peak quarter before the economy weakened and for each of the last five quarters

gross profit –  percentage for 2013 increased from 2012 

the gross profit percentage in the first second third and fourth quarters was as follows 



the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in 1 transactional gross profit 2 organizational gross profit and 3 vendor incentive gross profit the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the daytoday fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains the third component relates to vendor volume allowances in the shortterm periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third 

we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is 51 to 53 this is based on our current mix of products geographies end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business the following narrative may be more detail than you want however we believe it is an important recap to understanding the dynamics surrounding our gross profit patterns our business operated below our expected gross profit range at the end of 2009 and expanded into the low end of this range during 2010 in the second quarter of 2010 we moved into the middle of the range as the three components of gross profit improved the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components we remained in the middle of the range until the fourth quarter of 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2011 our gross profit felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of the range this drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional profit primarily due to changes in product and customer mix lower vendor incentive gross profit and lower freight utilization the latter two items created half of the gross profit drop and are more of a seasonal issue in the first quarter of 2012 our gross profit improved nominally over the previous quarter this was primarily caused by the seasonal improvement of vendor volume allowances as rising fuel prices offset our improvements in freight utilization in the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 our gross profit improved when compared to the first quarter most of this improvement related to improvements in our transactional gross profit the improvement was partially offset by the weakening of our selling prices in certain foreign markets due to changes in the exchange rate one item of note in the fourth quarter of 2012 we experienced a drop off in the freight component of our gross profit due to lower freight utilization a typical pattern due to the seasonal drop off in business this gross profit decline was offset by an improvement in the remaining portion of our transactional gross profit that centers on product transactional cost and customer pricing 

the first two quarters of 2013 experienced a strong improvement in gross profit a piece of this related to the seasonal impact of improving freight utilization but this improvement was constrained due to the weak sales growth the real driver of improvement related to our store personnel armed with our newly implemented price guidance system exercising great judgment about pricing their product during the third quarter of 2013 we experienced a sequential second to third quarter decline in our gross profit most of this decline was in the transactional profit about 85 of the change with the balance in the supplier incentive gross profit the decline in our supplier incentive gross profit was due to our continued pattern of weak sales growth within the transaction component product mix stood out as the most identifiable portion this was about 40 of the total drop and reflects the continued weakness in our fastener growth and the strength in the growth in safety products  fasteners carry a higher gross profit safety products dont the remaining portion of the transactional decline was split across a number of causes the result of a very competitive landscape and our competitive nature beginning in the third quarter we had 

placed a greater emphasis on expanding the headcount at our store locations putting more emphasis on shorter cycle sales efforts and moving the needle on top line growth this impacted our gross profit in the short term however we think this approach is the correct longterm move as it reinforces our trust in our store personnel and our desire to grow our business longterm but it does make for a bumpier ride in the fourth quarter of 2013 we experienced another sequential third to fourth quarter decline in gross profit similar to prior years we lost some gross profit due to a seasonal drop in freight utilization and in supplier incentive gross profit this represented about 30 of the drop and is expected to recover in the new year as volume increases seasonality and incentive programs reset typically calendar based the remaining drop relates to factors noted in the third quarter we believe our expected gross profit range 51 to 53 is still reasonable for 2014 

operating and administrative expenses   as a percentage of sales were essentially unchanged from 2012 to 2013 

historically our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately 65 to 70 and occupancy related expenses approximately 15 to 20 the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the comparable periods in the preceding year 



employee related expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes performance bonuses other than those related to our vending business were down in 2013 however this decrease was offset by increases related to the following factors 1 average employee headcount measured on a fulltime equivalent basis grew 86 from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013 2 sales commissions grew in 2013 due to the static gross profit combined with sales growth 3 our industrial vending bonuses grew in the first quarter and the twelve month period although they contracted in the second third and fourth quarters due to changes in the pace of the vending rollout 4 our profit sharing contribution grew and 5 our health care costs grew the increase in 2012 was driven by the following factors 1 average employee headcount measured on a fulltime equivalent basis grew 44 from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012 2 sales commissions grew 3 bonus amounts related to our growth drivers grew this includes items such as industrial vending bonuses and manager minimum pay adjustments and 4 our profit sharing contribution grew 

occupancy related expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our stores and distribution locations and 4 fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy the increase in 2013 was driven by 1 a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document 2 an increase in building utility cost 3 a nominal increase in the number of store locations and 4 an increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years in 2013 the industrial vending component represented approximately 60 of the increase with the balance related to our distribution automationexpansion and changes to utilities and external rent almost all of our occupancy increase in 2012 related to the increase in the amount of fast solutions ®  industrial vending equipment as our energy savings offset most of the increase relating to items 3 and 4 the energy savings were driven by our efforts to lower energy consumption a mild winter and a drop in natural gas prices during the heating season 

our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in the cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses were essentially flat in 2013 when compared to 2012 this was helped by stronger sales patterns related to our used store truck fleet which lowered our vehicle ownership costs the increase in 2012 was primarily related to the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our nonstore sales personnel particularly fast solutions ®  industrial vending vehicles 

the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline –  during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2013 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 106 106 112 and 96 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2012 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 106 108 108 and 103 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our nonstore sales force these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a yearoveryear basis for the last three years was as follows 



 income taxes   –  income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 371 and 376 for 2013 and 2012 respectively as our international business and profits grow over time the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states have begun to lower our effective tax rate 

net earnings –  net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2013 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the expansion of gross profit realized and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2012 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2011 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate 

operational working capital –  operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable net and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



the growth in accounts receivable noted above was driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period the strong growth in recent years with our international business and of our large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 3 expanded direct sourcing 4 expanded exclusive brands private label 5 expanded industrial vending solutions 6 national accounts growth 7 international growth and 8 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores items 1 through 7 created most of our inventory growth in both 2013 and 2012 while item 8 contributed to our inventory growth in 2012 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to target a ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari of approximately a 301 ratio on december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a ratio of 281 and 291 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities —  net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the increases in the net cash provided in each of the three years was primarily due to increases in earnings the lower percentage of the earnings figure in 2011 was primarily due to increases in inventory necessary to support our industrial vending and metalworking initiatives 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows at year end 



new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 50 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities —  net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used was primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below the 2012 figure was partially offset by the liquidation of marketable securities late in the year to help fund our supplemental dividend payment 

net property and equipment expenditures  in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the net capital expenditures increased over the three years the increases were primarily caused by the dramatic increase in the number of fast solutions ®  industrial vending machines deployed in our business 

property and equipment expenditures in 2013  2012  and 2011  consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 purchases related to fast solutions ®  industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment 2013 2012 and 2011 and the construction of a new centralized distribution facility 2013 and 8 cost related to the expansion of our distribution centers in winona minnesota 2012 and 2011 akron ohio 2013 atlanta georgia 2013 scranton pennsylvania 2013 kitchener ontario canada 2013 and indianapolis indiana 2013 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2014  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2013  2012  and 2011 net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity because of the considerable cash requirements expected in 2013 2014 and 2015 for expanding our fast solutions ® industrial vending and increasing the use of automation in our distribution centers together with the large dividend payout late in 2012 we established a 125000 unsecured credit facility in december 2012 during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2013 we borrowed up to 20000 10000 70000 and 75000 respectively under this facility all amounts were repaid at the end of each quarter as of year end we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures in addition as we enter 2014 we also expect to open new stores in the united states and continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future payments under operating leases the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 



net cash used in financing activities –  net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments and in the level of stock purchases these amounts were partially offset by the exercise of stock options by our employees and the related tax impact these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock purchases — during 2013 we purchased 200000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately 4540 per share we did not purchase any stock in 2012  or 2011 as of february 6 2014  we have authority from our board of directors to purchase up to 1600000 shares of our common stock 

dividends —  we declared a dividend of 025 per share on january 14 2014  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 080   124  and  065  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

line of credit —  a description of our credit facility is contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the description of our credit facility in note 10 is incorporated herein by reference 

effects of inflation—  in total we experienced minimal price changes in 2013  and 2012  at the product level we experienced some deflation in our fastener products and limited to slight inflation in our nonfastener products in 2013 

critical accounting policies—  our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments

tax strategies  – our effective income tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish income tax reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves  – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded

business 

tableend note – information in this section is as of year end december 31 2012  and also sometimes other years when indicated unless otherwise noted 

fastenal company together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we had 2652  store locations at year end the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later 

globally we employed 15145  people as of year end we characterize these personnel as follows 



we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion these industrial and construction supplies are grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document 

we operated 14 distribution centers in north america as of year end from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 



at year end we operated the following number of store locations 

  



we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction beginning in 2007 we disclosed our intention to continue opening new store locations at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year given the economic slowdown we decreased this to a range of 2 to 5 in 2009 and this lower rate continued into the first half of 2010 from july 2010 to december 2010 we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 7 in 2011 we opened new stores at the rate of approximately 5 and opened new stores at the rate of approximately 3 in 2012 we expect to open 65 to 80 stores in 2013  or a rate of approximately 25 to 3 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening store and district personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the first type of selling location – a fastenal store  location – is either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of all the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we have outside of north america 

in addition to the fastenal store  type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and ‘inplant’ sites a strategic account store  is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store  count a strategic account site  is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store  count an ‘inplant’ site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer ‘inplant’ sites are not included in the store  count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 



we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 11 of our consolidated net sales in 2012  with approximately 65 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn of the 28 stores opened in the first quarter of 2012  13 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2012  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2011  to 2012  based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2012  contributed approximately 24859 or approximately 08 of our consolidated net sales in 2012  with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2012  



 several years ago we introduced our fast solutions sm  industrial vending offering and it has been a rapidly expanding component of our business we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story and also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution both because of its benefits to our customers such as reduced consumption reduced inventory investment reduced purchase orders reduced product handling and 24hour product availability and its benefits to us in that it allows us to strengthen our relationships with our customers and streamline the supply chain we believe we have a first mover advantage in industrial vending and are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage 

at year end we operated eleven distribution centers in the united states—minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 27 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

we currently operate our minnesota indiana and texas distribution centers with automated storage and retrieval systems or asrs these distribution centers operate with greater speed and efficiency we intend to invest in this type of asrs distribution infrastructure over the next several years at our ohio pennsylvania georgia kansas and ontario canada locations 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks and we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ®  product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2012  2011  and 2010  and approximately 40 42 and 45 of our consolidated net sales in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

  



 each product line listed above may contain multiple product categories during the last several years we have added private label brands we sometimes refer to these as exclusive brands to our offering these private label brands currently represent approximately 10 of total sales most of these private label products are in the nonfastener product lines 

we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution 

centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2012  approximately 95 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 5 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications or standard sizes manufactured under our holokrome product line the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2012  

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading ‘item 8 financial statements and supplementary data’ foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2012  our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 396000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2012  no one customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business historically we have made limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we typically use include signs catalogs and direct mailings in recent years we have expanded our national advertising to include a nascar sponsorship utilizing fastenal racing ®  sponsoring carl edwards since 2010 and in 2011 we did some limited national advertising of our fast solutions sm  industrial vending through publications such as usa today  

seasonality 

seasonality has some impact on our sales during the winter months our sales to customers in the nonresidential construction market typically slow due to inclement weather also sales to our industrial production customers may decrease during the christmas and new year holidays due to plant shutdowns 

c ompetition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same smaller markets in which we have stores we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally 

located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our local storefront combined with fast solutions sm  industrial vending provide a unique way to provide to our customers convenient access to products and cost saving solutions in a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

employees 

at year end we employed a total of 15145  full and parttime employees most of whom were employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results  in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk was demonstrated during the last several years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves could adversely impact our business 

products that we sell may expose us to potential material liability for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death linked to the use of those products by our customers the products that we sell may expose us to potential claims for property damage environmental damage personal injury or death arising out of the use of those products by our customers some of our customers operate in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events if any of these events are linked to the use by our customers of any of our products claims could be brought against us by those customers by governmental authorities and by third parties who are injured or damaged as a result of such events in addition our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful while we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk and may have recourse against our suppliers for losses arising out of defects in products procured from them we could experience significant losses as a result of claims made against us to the extent adequate insurance is not in place the products are manufactured by us or legal recourse against our suppliers is otherwise not available or our insurers or suppliers are unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations to us 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues  the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of the company and customer data could be adversely affected disruptions or failures of or security breaches with respect to our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

we work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems and website in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace   the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems 

and website a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated consequently despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion interruption of our business cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect  one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings  our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores in 2007 and 2008 our business strategy focused on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year although the economic slowdown in the latter four months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2 to 5 for 2009 we opened stores at an annualized rate of 7 in the second half of 2010 we opened stores at the rate of approximately 5 and 3 in 2011 and 2012 respectively we expect to open new stores at the rate of approximately 25 to 3 in 2013  however failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

our current business strategy pathwaytoprofit which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add sales personnel at a faster rate while successful over the last several years has not yet proven successful on a long‑term basis in april 2007 we introduced our pathway to profit strategy this strategy initially involved slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax earnings at the time we introduced this strategy we believed that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we could grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pre‑tax earnings as a percent of net sales from 18 to 23 the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2 to 5 and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing because of this economic setback we previously indicated that the time required to achieve our pretax earnings percentage goals for pathway to profit could be delayed 24 to 30 months more recently we have indicated we believe we could hit our pretax earnings percentage goal with less than the 125 thousand per month figure we now believe the pretax earnings goal might be accomplished with average store sales as low as 100 to 110 thousand per month due to the structural lowering of our costs we believe this will shorten the extended time line for achieving our goal to 2013 however we cannot assure this will occur a more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected the prospect of future economic deterioration changes in the rate of new store openings difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel an inability to realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve desired pre‑tax earnings results 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future  changes in our customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins in addition gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations  we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to 

achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results  while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins  our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins  costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings  our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system  our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and 2012 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales  because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations over which we have no control  we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

our business may be adversely affected by political gridlock in the united states  we primarily operate in the united states during the last several years there has been significant fiscal uncertainty in the country the resolution of which has been impeded by political gridlock we believe this has adversely impacted our business and could negatively impact our business in the future  

our fast solutions sm  industrial vending business is new and our competitive advantage could be eliminated  we believe we have a competitive advantage due to our industrial vending platform hardware and software our local store presence our vendible product depth and in north america our distribution strength these advantages have developed over time however other competitors could respond to our rapidly expanding industrial vending business with highly competitive platforms of their own these alternative solutions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business andor negatively impact the economics of the industrial vending business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business  the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects 

we will need to begin disclosing our use of conflict minerals in certain of the products we distribute which will impose costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks the sec has promulgated final rules in connection with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in fiscal year 2013 and thereafter with initial disclosure requirements effective in may 2014 there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs to determine which of our products are subject to the new rules and the source of any conflict minerals used in those products in addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in those products also we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in products through the procedures we may implement we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2700 company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

like most industrial and construction centric organizations we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years the third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices between 40 and 50 of our sales consist of some type of fastener – nuts bolts screws etc – most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout much of 2009 this inflation turned to deflation when the swings are dramatic this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices this hurt our gross margins in 2009 the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation the deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in 2010 and 2011 see later discussion on gross margins 

the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2012  this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year however we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales change sequential trend and end market information that follows – that information explains the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 

over the last several years we have continued to make significant investments in 1 store locations 2 national accounts 3 government sales 4 internal manufacturing support 5 international operations now over 10 of our sales 6 fast solutions sm  industrial vending 7 product expansion with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands 8 additional sales specialists to support safety products metalworking products and our manufacturing operations and 9 additional sales operational support to focus on under performing stores and under performing industrial vending we are excited about the prospects of each 

as always the ‘pathway to profit’ is the cornerstone of our business evolution and it influences everything we do remember our business centers on our 2700 stores – their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time as always we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service  

sales growth 

net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 



the increase in net sales in 2012  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions sm  industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was hindered by weakness in the industrial production and nonresidential construction industries served by our company the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 01 in 2012  

the increase in net sales in 2011  came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions sm  industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by the moderating impacts of the previous recessionary environment the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 07 in 2011  

the increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the previous recessionary environment the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holokrome business which we acquired in december 2009 these two items added approximately 06 and 05 percentage points respectively to our growth in 2010 

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2012 group – opened 2002 and earlier 2011 group – opened 2001 and earlier and 2010 group – opened 2000 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2012 group – opened 2007 and earlier 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier and 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2012 group – opened 2010 and earlier 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier and 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 



note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2012  contributed approximately 24859 or 08 to 2012  net sales stores opened in 2011  contributed approximately 85318 or 27 to 2012  net sales and approximately 27120 or 10 to 2011  net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 



monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

note – daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes  provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends  that is comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance  provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales –  during the months in 2012 2011 and 2010 all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 



the growth in the first three and a half months of 2012 generally continued the relative strength we saw in 2011 and in most of 2010 during 2012 there were two distinct economic slowdowns the first occurred in the late aprilmay time frame and then moderated until september the second occurred in the octobernovember time frame this was exaggerated by an unusual business day comparison in october 23 days in 2012 versus 21 days in 2011  the maintenance portion of our business is often linked to monthly spend patterns which are not as business day dependent this can dilute the daily growth picture given the change in business day divisor and the impact of hurricane sandy the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by 01 during 2012 this lowered our growth in the first second and third quarters by 01 04 02 respectively and increased our growth in the fourth quarter by 02 this was a sharp contrast to 2011 and 2010 when changes in foreign currencies increased our growth by 07 and 06 respectively 

stores opened greater than two  years –  our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2012 group – opened 2010 and earlier 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier and 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business during the months in 2012 2011 and 2010 the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 



stores opened greater than five  years –  the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2012 group – opened 2007 and earlier 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier and 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier this group is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during the months in 2012 2011 and 2010 the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 



sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –  this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in 2012 2011 and 2010 the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas  new year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003 we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics a weaker industrial economy in north america and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line the 2012 2011 and 2010 lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the 12delta 11delta and 10delta lines indicate the difference between the past and the actual results in the respective year 



 a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

several observations stand out while viewing the 2012 sequential pattern 1 the direction of the historical sequential pattern increased daily sales on a sequential basis in february march may june august and september and decreased daily sales on a sequential basis in april and july has played out each month however the cumulative growth in the daily sales from january to october has fallen short of the benchmark figure and of the actual results in 2011 and 2010 2 the magnitude of the february and may 12delta of approximately 28 was similar this fact as well as the choppiness of the year in general caused us to approach the year with a conservative tone 3 the weakness in 2012 was amplified in the first three quarters of the year by changes in foreign currencies primarily canada relative to the us dollar as indicated earlier 

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business –  the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales to these customers grew in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 



our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing the industrial business is more fastener centered while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 

in the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 the decrease in the rate of growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business this is in sharp contrast to the first quarter of 2012 where the growth was more pronounced in the industrial production business a trend that had also existed in 2011 and 2010 the first quarter and prior quarters were a direct counter to the 2009 contraction which was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business 

the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line in the first three months of 2012 the daily sales growth in our fastener product line was approximately 154 this growth dropped to 105 61 and 86 in april may and june respectively and then averaged 60 and 26 in the third and fourth quarters respectively by contrast the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our nonfastener product lines in the first three months of 2012 the daily sales growth in our nonfastener business was approximately 251 this dropped to 244 190 and 196 in april may and june respectively and averaged 180 and 136 in the third and fourth quarters respectively the nonfastener business has demonstrated relative resilience in 2012 when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general due to our strong fast solutions sm  industrial vending program this is discussed in greater detail later in this document 

the patterns related to the industrial production business as noted above are influenced by the movements noted in the purchasing manufacturers index pmi published by the institute for supply management httpwwwismws which is a composite index of economic activity in the united states manufacturing sector the pmi in 2012 2011 and 2010 was as follows 



for background to readers not familiar with the pmi index it is a monthly indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector five major indicators that influence the pmi index are new orders inventory levels productions supplier deliveries and the employment environment when a pmi of 50 or higher is reported this indicates expansion in the manufacturing industry compared to the previous month if the pmi is below 50 this represents a contraction in the manufacturing sector 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 



we believe the weakness in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 particularly in the nonresidential construction market was amplified by the political uncertainty in the united states 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2012 2011 and 2010 starting with a base of 100 in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

nonresidential construction 

growth drivers of our business 

we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer we believe this growth is enhanced by our close proximity to our customers which allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors cant easily match historically we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace these openings were initially in the united states but expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid 1990s 

in our first ten years of being public 1987 to 1997 we opened stores at a rate approaching 30 per year in the next ten years we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately 10 to 15 and over the last five years at a rate of approximately 3 to 8 we currently expect to open approximately 65 to 80 stores in 2013 or approximately 25 to 30 as we gained proximity to more customers we continued to diversify our growth drivers this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically and the results of this are reflected in our earlier discussion on sales growth at stores opened greater than five years in the early 1990s we began to expand our product lines and we added new product knowledge to our bench this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers the next step began in the mid to late 1990s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus this began with our national accounts group in 1995 and over time has expanded to include individuals dedicated to 1 sales related to our internal manufacturing division 2 government sales 3 internet sales 4 specific products most recently metal working and 5 fast solutions sm  industrial vending another step occurred at our sales locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and inplant locations and at our distribution centers and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately ten years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately five years ago this strategy allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store regional distribution center master stocking hub or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment lower our freight costs and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers 

our fast solutions sm  industrial vending operation is a rapidly expanding component of our business   we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story we also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution and that we have a first mover advantage we are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage at our investor day in may 2011 we discussed our progress with industrial vending in addition to our discussion regarding progress we discussed our goals with the rollout of the industrial vending machines one of the goals we identified related to our rate of machine signings the first category below – our goal was simple sign 2500 machines per quarter or an annualized run rate of 10000 machines in 2012 we hit our annual goal of 10000 machines during july and the momentum has continued as we finished the year we intend to continue our aggressive push with fast solutions sm industrial vending and to this end have established an internal goal to sign 30000 machines in 2013 or 2500 per month rather than per quarter this is an aggressive goal but we believe we can hit this run rate during 2013 in addition during 2012 we developed plans to 1 reinvigorate our fastener growth and to 2 improve the performance ie sales growth at underperforming locations these plans centered on expanding our sales team for industrial production business improving our delivery systems for other fastener business and expanding the team that supports underperforming stores and districts 

the following table includes some statistics regarding our industrial vending business note  we added the third category of information in this report to highlight the mix change in the machines deployed as our business expands beyond the flagship fast 5000 machine

profit drivers of our business 

we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through – we refer to this as the pathway to profit the distinction is important 

we achieve improvements in our relative profitability by increasing our gross margin by structurally lowering our operating expenses or both we advance on the pathway to profit by increasing the average store size measured in terms of monthly sales and by allowing the changing store mix to improve our profits this is best explained by comparing the varying profitability of our traditional stores in the table below the average store size for the group and the average age number of stores and pretax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter  of 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively were as follows 

note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

when we originally announced the pathway to profit strategy in 2007 our goal was to increase our pretax earnings as a percentage of sales from 18 to 23 this goal was to be accomplished by slowly moving the mix from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 these groups represented 765 of our store base in the first three months of 2007 the last quarter before we announced the pathway to profit to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 these groups represented 530 of our store base in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by increasing the average store sales to approximately 125000 per month the weak economic environment in 2009 caused our average store size to decrease and consequently lowered our level of profitability however subsequent to 2009 we improved our gross margin and structurally lowered our operating expenses this improvement allowed us to amplify the pathway to profit and effectively lowered the average store size required to hit our 23 goal today we believe we can accomplish our pathway to profit goal with average store sales of approximately 100000 to 110000 per month in the second quarter of 2012 we achieved a pretax earnings percentage of 222 with average store sales of 89169 per month 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount –  the table that follows highlights certain impacts on our business of the pathway to profit since its introduction in 2007 under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during 2007 and 2008 however the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008 in the table that follows we refer to our store net sales locations and personnel when we discuss store net sales locations and personnel we are referring to 1 fastenal stores and 2 strategic account stores fastenal stores are either a traditional store the typical format in the united states or canada or an overseas store which is the typical format outside the united states and canada this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this form 10k strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market the sales outside of our store group relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holokrome business acquired in december 2009 or 3 our direct import business 

the breakdown of our sales the average monthly sales per store the number of stores at quarter end the average headcount at our stores during a quarter the average fte headcount during a quarter and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit for the third quarter of 2008 our peak quarter before the economy weakened and for each of the last five quarters

gross profit –  percentage for 2012 decreased from 2011 but stabilized in the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 

the gross profit percentage in the first second third and fourth quarters was as follows 



the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in 1 transactional gross profit 2 organizational gross profit and 3 vendor incentive gross profit the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the daytoday fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains the third component relates to vendor volume allowances in the shortterm periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third 

we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is 51 to 53 this is based on our current mix of products geographies end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business our business operated below our expected gross profit range at the end of 2009 and expanded into the low end of this range during 2010 in the second quarter of 2010 we moved into the middle of the range as the three components of gross profit improved the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components we remained in the middle of the range until the fourth quarter of 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2011 our gross margin felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of the range this drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin primarily due to changes in product and customer mix lower vendor incentive gross profit and lower freight utilization the latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue in the first quarter of 2012 our gross margin improved nominally over the previous quarter this was primarily caused by the seasonal improvement of vendor volume allowances as rising fuel prices offset our improvements in freight utilization in the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 our gross margin improved when compared to the first quarter most of this improvement related to improvements in our transactional gross margin the improvement was partially offset by the weakening of our selling prices in certain foreign markets due to changes in the exchange rate one item of note in the fourth quarter of 2012 we experienced a drop off in the freight component of our gross margin due to lower freight utilization a typical pattern due to the seasonal drop off in business this decline was offset by an improvement in the remaining portion of our transactional gross margin that centers on product transactional cost and customer pricing 

operating and administrative expenses   improved relative to sales in both 2012 as a whole and the fourth quarter  of 2012 versus 2011 as a whole and the fourth quarter of 2011 

historically our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately 65 to 70 and occupancy related expenses approximately 15 to 20 the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew as follows for the periods ended december 31 compared to the comparable periods in the preceding year 



employee related expenses include 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes the increase in 2012 was driven by the following factors 1 average employee headcount measured on a fulltime equivalent basis grew 87 2 sales commissions grew 3 bonus amounts related to our growth drivers grew this includes items such as industrial vending bonuses and manager minimum pay adjustments and 4 our profit sharing contribution grew the increase in 2011 was driven by the following factors 1 employee headcount measured on a fulltime equivalent basis grew 150 2 sales commissions grew this increase was amplified by stronger sales growth relative to 2010 which had a meaningful impact on the commission earned and higher gross profit margins 3 total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth 4 hours worked per employee grew and 5 our profit sharing contribution grew 

occupancy related expenses include 1 building rent and depreciation 2 building utility costs 3 equipment related to our stores and distribution locations and 4 fast solutions sm  industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy the increase in 2012 was driven by 1 a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm  industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document 2 an increase in the number of locations and 3 increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years almost all of our occupancy increase in 2012 related to item 4 a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment as our energy savings offset most of the increase relating to items 1 and 3 the energy savings were driven by our efforts to lower energy consumption a mild winter and a drop in natural gas prices during the heating season the increase in 2011 was driven by the same factors noted above with one exception in 2011 approximately 50 of the increase was due to rising utility costs 

our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in the cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in 2012 however they increased at a rate less than sales growth the increase in 2012 was primarily due to elevated fuel prices in the first quarter and in the case of the first second and third quarters the impact of the 2011 expansion of our fleet related to additions to our nonstore sales personnel particularly our industrial vending vehicles the increase in 2011 was primarily related to the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our nonstore sales personnel particularly our industrial vending vehicles our selling and transportation costs in the fourth quarter  of 2012 were comparable to those in the fourth quarter of 2011 because the per gallon fuel costs only grew nominally and the number of our industrial vending vehicles had normalized conversely the increase in the fourth quarter  of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 was driven by the dramatic increase in per gallon fuel costs and the ramp up in the number of our industrial vending vehicles 

the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline –  during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2012 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 106 108 108 and 103 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2011 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 86 105 98 and 98 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our nonstore sales force these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a yearoveryear basis for the last three years was as follows 



 income taxes   –  incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 376 and 378 for 2012 and 2011 respectively as our international business and profits grow over time the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions relative to the united states have begun to lower our effective tax rate 

net earnings –  net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 



during 2012  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2011 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2010  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth 

operational working capital –  operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 



1  for purposes of this discussion we are defining operational working capital as accounts receivable net and inventories 

the growth in accounts receivable noted above was driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period the strong growth in recent years of our international business and large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales this was exaggerated by the short month in december 2012 versus 2011 19 business days versus 21 days and due to a drop off in payment activity due to christmas day and new years day falling on a tuesday resulting in a number of our customers being shut down for the last full week of december we saw a similar short month impact in september 2012 also as indicated above our sales in the last two months of the year grew from 2011 to 2012 by 39 however our daily sales growth in the last two months of 2012 was 91 which resulted in increased year end receivables 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores 3 expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2005 to 2011 4 expanded direct sourcing 5 expanded exclusive brands private label and 6 expanded fast solutions sm industrial vending solutions items 4 5 and 6 plus the impact of strong growth with national accounts and international expansion created most of our inventory growth in both 2012 and 2011 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari back to a better than a 301 ratio on december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a ratio of 291 and 281 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities —  net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the increases in the net cash provided in each of the three years was primarily due to increases in earnings the lower percentage of the earnings figure in 2011 was primarily due to increases in inventory necessary to support our industrial vending and metalworking initiatives 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows at year end 



new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 50 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities —  net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the changes in net cash used was primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below the 2012 figure was partially offset by the liquidation of marketable securities late in the year to help fund our supplemental dividend payment 

net property and equipment expenditures  in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the net capital expenditures increased over the three years the increases were primarily caused by the dramatic increase in the number of fast solutions sm  industrial vending machines deployed in our business 

property and equipment expenditures in 2012  2011  and 2010  consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center 2010 8 cost of a new manufacturing facility for our holokrome business in wallingford connecticut 2010 9 purchases related to fast solutions sm  industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and 10 cost related to the expansion of our winona minnesota distribution center 2012 and 2011 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 

set forth below is an estimate of our 2013  net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2012  2011  and 2010 net capital expenditures 



we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and from our borrowing capacity because of the considerable cash required in 2013 for expanding our fast solutions sm industrial vending and increasing the use of automation in our distribution centers together with the large dividend payout late in 2012 we established a 125000 unsecured credit facility in december 2012 to provide additional cash flow in that month and in 2013 and 2014 in addition to opening new stores in the united states we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets as of year end we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 



net cash used in financing activities –  net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 



the fluctuations are due to changes in the level of our dividend payments this amount was partially offset by the exercise of stock options by our employees in 2012 and 2011 these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 



stock repurchase — we did not purchase any stock in 2012  2011  or 2010 as of february 7 2013  we have authority from our board of directors to purchase up to 1800000 shares of our common stock 

dividends —  we declared a dividend of 010 per share on january 16 2013  we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 124   065  and  062  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

line of credit —  a description of our credit facility is contained in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the description of our credit facility in note 10 is incorporated herein by reference 

effects of inflation—  we noted minimal price changes in 2012  and 2011  

critical accounting policies—  our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 

allowance for doubtful accounts  – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 

inventory reserve  – this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends the analysis includes inventory levels sales information physical inventory counts cycle count adjustments and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results

tax strategies  – our effective income tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish income tax reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves  – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded

 item 1 business tableend note – information in this section is as of year end december 31 2011 and also sometimes other years when indicated unless otherwise noted 

fastenal company together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we had 2585 store locations at year end the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later 

globally we employed 15168 people as of year end we characterize their roles as follows 

 

 we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion these industrial and construction supplies are grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document 

we operated 14 distribution centers in north america as of year end from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

at year end we operated the following number of store locations 

 

 we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction beginning in 2007 we disclosed our intention to continue opening new store locations at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year given the economic slowdown we decreased this to a range of 2 to 5 in 2009 and this lower rate continued into the first half of 2010 from july 2010 to december 2010 we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 7 in 2011 we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 5 we expect to open 100 to 150 stores in 2012 or a rate of approximately 4 to 6 calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening store and district personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the first type of selling location – a fastenal store location can be further defined as either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of all the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we have outside of north america 

in addition to the fastenal store type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and ‘inplant’ sites a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store count a strategic account site is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store count an ‘inplant’ site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer ‘inplant’ sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

  

we opened the following stores in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 with approximately 68 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn of the 37 stores opened in the first quarter of 2011 19 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2010 to 2011 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2011 contributed approximately 27120 or approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2011 

 

  

  at year end we operated eleven distribution centers in the united states—minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 27 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks see table below we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

  

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies and hardware such as various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors metal framing systems wire rope strut rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 and approximately 42 45 and 45 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

  we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their 

  

district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2011 approximately 95 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 5 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 1158000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2011 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading ‘item 8 financial statements and supplementary data’ foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2011 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 385000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2011 no one customer accounted for more than 10 of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business historically we have made limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we typically use include signs catalogs and direct mailings in recent years we have expanded our national advertising to include a nascar sponsorship utilizing fastenal racing ® sponsoring carl edwards since 2010 and in 2011 we did some limited national advertising of our fast solutions sm industrial vending through publications such as usa today  

  

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience product availability and cost saving solutions 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products we also believe our local storefront combined with our fast solutions sm industrial vending provide a unique method to expand availability and provide cost saving solutions to our customer in a business model not easily replicated by our competitors having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

employees 

at year end we employed a total of 15168 full and parttime employees most of whom were employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store district and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

           a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk was demonstrated during the last several years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and into 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves could adversely impact our business 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of the company and customer data could be adversely affected disruptions failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings our growth is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores in 2007 and 2008 our business strategy focused on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year although the economic slowdown in the latter four months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2 to 5 for 2009 we opened stores at an annualized rate of 7 in the second half of 2010 we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 5 in 2011 we expect to open approximately 4 to 6 new stores in 2012 however failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

our current business strategy ‘pathwaytoprofit’ which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add sales personnel at a faster rate while successful over the last several years has not yet proven successful on a longterm basis in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy this strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax earnings at the time we introduced this strategy we believed that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we could grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pretax earnings as a percent of net sales from 18 to 23 the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by temporarily slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2 to 5 and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing because of this economic setback we previously indicated that the time required to achieve our pretax earnings percentage goals for ‘pathway to profit’ could be delayed 24 to 30 months more recently we have indicated we believe we could hit our pretax earnings percentage goal with less than the 125 thousand per month figure we now believe the pretax earnings goal might be accomplished with average store sales as low as 100 to 110 thousand per month due to the structural lowering of our costs this could shorten the extended time line for achieving our goal to 2013 however we cannot assure this will occur a more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected the prospect of future economic deterioration changes in the rate of new store openings difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel an inability to realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve desired pretax earnings results 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future changes in our customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins in addition gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

  

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

  

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations over which we have no control we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations domestic government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend a discussion of our policies with respect to legal proceedings is discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis and our legal proceedings and other loss contingencies as described in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements the description of our legal proceedings in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements to this filing is incorporated herein by reference 

in early february 2010 we received a letter from a california fastener supplier dated january 26 2010 this letter threatened to sue us for an alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations in addition to the letter this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim shortly after receipt of this letter we performed a preliminary internal review to understand 1 who this supplier was and 2 the nature of our relationship with this supplier based on that review we determined that this supplier manufactures a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by us from all suppliers over the purported term of the alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener did not exceed 1 million following completion of our preliminary internal review we requested additional information and documentation from the supplier the supplier’s response failed to provide the requested information and documentation by letter dated february 26 2010 we quantified for the supplier our total volume of purchases as discussed above and informed the supplier that we believed their claim was grossly exaggerated and completely unsupported we have not received any direct response to our february 26 2010 letter on may 3 2010 this supplier filed suit in arkansas federal court alleging damages in response we filed a motion to dismiss this motion to dismiss was denied on august 16 2010 we subsequently filed two motions for summary judgment the first summary judgment motion was partially denied 

on august 24 2011 the court issued an order granting fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment in its entirety on september 8 2011 this supplier filed an appeal in connection with the order granting fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment on december 16 2011 the court issued an order granting in part fastenal’s request to recover on its bill of costs and petition for attorney’s fees from this supplier which order this supplier appealed on january 9 2012 both appealed orders are pending based on current information we believe the prospect that we will incur a material liability as a result of this claim is remote while we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of 

  

the securities and exchange commission we initially disclosed the existence of this threat in february 2010 in our 2009 annual report on form 10k as we believed that disclosure was prudent due to the alleged amount 180 million of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

  

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2600 company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

like most industrial and construction centric organizations we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years the third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices approximately 50 of our sales consist of some type of fastener – nuts bolts screws etc – most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout much of 2009 this inflation turned to deflation when the swings are dramatic this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices this hurt our gross margins in 2009 the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation the deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in 2010 and 2011 see later discussion on gross margins 

the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2011 this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year however we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market information that follow – they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 

over the last several years we have continued to make significant investments in 1 store locations 2 national accounts 3 government sales 4 internal manufacturing support 5 international operations now over 10 of our sales 6 fast solutions sm industrial vending 7 product expansion with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands and 8 additional sales specialists to support safety products metalworking products and our manufacturing operations we are excited about the prospects of each 

as always the ‘pathway to profit’ is the cornerstone of our business evolution and it influences everything we do remember our business centers on our 2600 stores – their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time as always we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service  

sales growth 

net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 

 

 the increase in net sales in 2011 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products but the impact was limited our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions sm industrial vending the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008 the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 07 in 2011 

  

the increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008 the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holokrome business which we acquired in december 2009 these two items added approximately 07 and 05 percentage points respectively to our growth in 2010 

the decrease in net sales in 2009 came primarily from lower unit sales the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes particularly in our steel based products our sales change in 2009 was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services the lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years the decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in 2008 and the first part of 2009 

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2011 group – opened 2001 and earlier 2010 group – opened 2000 and earlier and 2009 group – opened 1999 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier and 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier and 2009 group – opened 2007 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 

 

 note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2011 contributed approximately 27120 or 10 to 2011 net sales stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately 78458 or 28 to 2011 net sales and approximately 22040 or 10 to 2010 net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 

 

   

comments regarding monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

note – daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business finally we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

all company sales – during each of the twelve months in 2011 2010 and 2009 all of our selling locations when combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

 the growth in 2010 and 2011 generally continues the improving trend we saw in the latter half of 2009 the negative growth in 2009 relates to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 07 during 2011 

stores opened greater than two years – our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2011 group – opened 2009 and earlier 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier and 2009 group – opened 2007 and earlier represent a consistent ‘samestore’ view of our business during each of the twelve months in 2011 2010 and 2009 the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

 stores opened greater than five years – the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier and 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier this group is more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets during each of the twelve months in 2011 2010 and 2009 the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

 sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

  

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in both 2011 and 2010 the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas  new year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled ‘past’ is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003 we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics a weaker industrial economy in north america and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line the ‘2010’ and ‘2011’ lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the ‘10delta’ line is the difference between the ‘past’ and ‘2010’ similarly the ‘11delta’ is the difference between the ‘past’ and ‘2011’ 

 

  

 during 2010 and 2011 sales were strong—our business has closely followed the trend line since the fall of 2009 the months of february 2011 and 2010 were both negatively impacted by weather 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above starting with a base of ‘100’ in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

 

  

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business – the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 

 

 the 2011 and 2010 growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and less pronounced in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing the 2009 contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business these patterns are influenced by the movements noted in the purchasing manufacturers index ‘pmi’ published by the institute for supply management  httpwwwismws  which is a composite index of economic activity in the manufacturing sector the pmi in 2011 2010 and 2009 was as follows 

 

 our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 

 

 on a sequential basis the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in may 2009 and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms this reversed the negative trend which began in october 2008 this stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our nonresidential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of 2009 and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 

  

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2009 2010 and 2011 starting with a base of ‘100’ in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows

pathway to profit and its impact on our business 

in april 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business – for most of the preceding ten years we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately 14 new stores each year as announced in april 2007 we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7 to 10 per year see our disclosure below regarding store growth in recent periods our goal was fourfold 1 to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model 2 to grow the sales of our average store to 125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012 3 to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow resulting in a growth of our pretax earnings to 23 of net sales by 2012 and 4 to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average sales volume per store increases the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the ‘pathway to profit’ in 2009 these changes centered on two aspects 1 temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of 2 to 5 per year and 2 temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing however as our business trends started to improve late in 2009 we began to increase our planned openings and headcount growth see later discussion on future store openings and on store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount 

the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business 1 sales force headcount 2 store or unit growth and 3 average sales volume per store which ultimately drive our level of profitability our original goal was to hit the 125 thousand per month store average and grow our pretax earnings to 23 of net sales by 2012 we previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by 2430 months however in 2010 we modified our thought process around the 

  

‘pathway to profit’ in two regards first the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative is slowly lowering our cost structure with a structurally lowered cost structure and improved gross margins we concluded we could hit our profitability target in the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative with average store sales of 100—110 thousand per month in 2013 see evidence of this in our ‘store size and profitability’ table later in this document second we decided to hire fewer storebased employees and instead added resources focused on specific sales opportunities such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists manufacturing government industry focused and industrial vending the decision to accelerate the addition of nonstore selling resources into the areas of national accounts and dedicated sales specialists reinforces our belief that these areas represent an efficient manner to accelerate sales at existing stores 

future store openings and increases in fast solutions sm industrial vending— in july 2010 we indicated our intentions to open 80 to 95 new stores during the second half of 2010 or an annualized rate of 68 to 80 during the second half of 2010 we opened 82 stores for 2011 we originally disclosed our intention to open 150 to 200 new stores or an annualized rate of 60 to 80 as the pmi began to moderate in may 2011 see table earlier in this document our field personnel began to slow their store openings as a result we opened 122 new stores in 2011 or approximately 49 in 2012 we expect to open approximately 40 to 60 new stores we believe this is a rational reaction to the current pmi and due to the good results we are experiencing with our national accounts and dedicated sales specialists particularly related to our fast solutions sm industrial vending rollout discussed below during 2011 and 2010 we closed 28 and seven stores respectively these closures resulted from our belief we could better serve those local markets with a different store footprint we have closed 64 stores in our 40 year history 

as was discussed at our investor day in may 2011 we have made significant progress in the development of fast solutions sm industrial vending for our customers we believe these solutions have the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution some key statistics regarding this business include the following 

 

  

    in addition to the increases in the number of vending machine contracts signed and the sales results noted we are pleased with the rampup in our ability to install machines in the third and fourth quarter of 2011 we installed 1775 machines 5642 versus 3867 and 1811 machines 7453 versus 5642 respectively a dramatic increase over the 331 1515 versus 1184 and 410 machines 1925 versus 1515 installed in the third and fourth quarter of 2010 respectively 

  

store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount— the two tables that follow highlight certain impacts of the ‘pathway to profit’ under the ‘pathway to profit’ we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during 2007 and 2008 however as indicated earlier the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008 in the two tables that follow we refer to our ‘store’ sales ‘store’ locations ‘store’ personnel and ‘store’ profitability when we discuss ‘stores’ in the first table we are referring to 1 ‘fastenal’ stores and 2 strategic account stores ‘fastenal’ stores are either a ‘traditional’ store the typical format in north america or an ‘overseas’ store which is the typical format outside the united states and canada this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this report strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market when we discuss in the second table our profitability as the average monthly ‘store’ sales grow we are referring to ‘traditional’ stores the sales outside of our ‘store’ group relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holokrome business acquired in december 2009 or 3 our direct import business 

the breakdown of our sales the average monthly sales per store the number of stores at quarter end the average headcount at our stores during a quarter the average fte headcount during a quarter and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the ‘pathway to profit’ for the third quarter of 2008 our peak quarter before the economy weakened and for each of the last five quarters 

  

 

  

   

store size and profitability – the average age number of stores and pretax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively were as follows 

 

 note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

our original intent under the ‘pathway to profit’ was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately 125000 per month see earlier discussion in order to meet our pretax earnings profitability goal of 23 this would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity our goal today is to continue 1 to grow the business and 2 to grow our pretax earnings as a percent of net sales as stated earlier we now believe based on the profitability improvements noted in the table above we can hit our pretax earnings percent goal of 23 with average store sales of approximately 100000—110000 per month 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands

gross profit – relative to sales was consistent in 2011 and 2010 and improved from 2009 

the gross profit percentage in the first second third and fourth quarters was as follows 

 

 the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in 1 transactional gross profit 2 organizational gross profit and 3 vendor incentive gross profit the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the daytoday fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains the third component relates to vendor volume allowances 

in the shortterm periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third this impact can be magnified as in 2009 due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year 

in the past we have indicated that we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is 51 to 53 this is based on our current mix of products geographies end markets and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business we exceeded this range late in 2008 primarily due to inflationary trends in our business the impact was evenly split between the transactional and organizational gross profit categories this benefit carried into the first quarter of 2009 and quickly dissipated in the second quarter of 2009 the trend flipped to deflation and our gross margin began to drop about 80 of this drop was evenly split between the same two categories and the other 20 related to the dramatic drop in business volumes and the related drop in vendor incentive gross profit in the second half of 2009 these two factors deflation and a drop in business volume plus the competitive environment of a severe recession pushed our gross margin to the bottom and then just below our expected range this drop was equally felt in the three categories noted above 

our business began to expand during 2010 and the drag on gross margins related to deflation began to subside this allowed our gross margins to move back into the expected range in the second quarter of 2010 we moved into the middle of our expected gross profit range as the three components of gross profit improved the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components we remained in the middle of the expected range until the fourth quarter of 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2011 our gross margin felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of our range this drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin primarily due to changes in product and customer mix lower vendor incentive gross profit and lower freight utilization the latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue 

  

operating and administrative expenses —improved relative to sales in 2011 versus both 2010 and 2009 

historically 65 to 70 of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs the components are 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care 3 personnel development and 4 social taxes during 2009 these components had reduced to a range between 60 and 65 due to the factors noted below during 2011 and 2010 this range moved back to the historical level 

the two largest components of employee related costs grewcontracted as follows 

 

 the two largest components of operating and administrative expenses outside of the employee related costs grewcontracted as follows 

 

 the increase in payroll costs during 2011 and 2010 noted above was greater than the change in fulltime equivalent headcount noted earlier in this document this was driven by the following factors 1 sales commissions grew this increase is amplified by sales growth and in the case of 2010 versus 2009 gross margin expansion both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned 2 total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth 3 hours worked per employee grew and 4 our profit sharing contribution grew the payroll growth in 2011 versus 2010 was amplified because there were four quarters of strong growth in 2010 the first quarter was still at a relatively lower level of pretax profit this expanded for the last three quarters of 2010 

our health care costs in 2011 increased from 2010 our health care costs in the third quarter of 2010 decreased from the unusual peak in the same period of 2009 health care costs in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 increased dramatically due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers increases in cobra costs due to changes in federal funding within cobra and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years the 2011 health care costs represented a more normal level of per employee expenses relative to 2010 and 2009 this resulted in a lower level of growth relative to the industry 

the two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation occupancy expenses increased from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010 the increase from 2010 was driven by 1 a meaningful increase in utilities 2 a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this release we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy 3 an increase in the number of locations and 4 increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years the selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses for 2011 increased significantly from 2010 a sharp contrast to the prior year’s trend most of the components of selling transportation costs increased at a rate less than sales growth with two exceptions the fuel component and the vehicle depreciationlease payments components increased more than sales growth in 2011 this was driven primarily by the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our nonstore sales personnel particularly industrial vending vehicles 

  

the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline— during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2011 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 86 105 98 and 98 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2010 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 64 68 66 and 71 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store and other sales centered use 

the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a yearoveryear basis for the last three years was as follows 

 

  

 loss on sale of property and equipment— the loss on sale of property and equipment for 2011 and 2010 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 

income taxes— incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 378 384 and 380 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively this rate fluctuates over time based on 1 the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 2 the level of profits in those jurisdictions and 3 changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

  

net earnings – net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 

 

 during 2011 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate during 2010 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth during 2009 the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion the eps percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2008 and 2009 

operational working capital – operational working capital which we define as accounts receivable and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 

 

  

 the growth in accounts receivable noted above is driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period the strong growth in recent years with our international business and with large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 

our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable this is impacted by other aspects of our business for example the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns over the last decade we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following 1 new store openings 2 expanded stocking breadth at individual stores 3 expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2006 to 2011 4 expanded direct sourcing 5 expanded exclusive brands and more recently 6 expanded fast solutions sm industrial vending we believe these were excellent investments for our business these investments have and we believe will continue to leverage our sales growth 

the discussion above covers inventory from a longer perspective in more recent quarters our expanding inventories are also related to 1 our expanding sales growth trends with emphasis on our large account business – both oem and mro 2 our confidence in their sustainability 3 international expansion and in recent months 4 some inflation however this expansion has been at a rate less than sales growth which has allowed us to improve our inventory utilization 

  

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari back to a better than a 301 ratio on december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a ratio of 281 and 271 respectively 

acquisition – on december 18 2009 we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener the business had an established name ‘holokrome’ and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees the business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the ‘all cash’ acquisition as noted in our cash flow statement the acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in 2011 and 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2011 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in earnings the 2010 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales the 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was unusually high primarily due to the weak economy and the decrease in working capital needed in the business 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december 31 

 

 new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 50 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities — net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

   

net property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the net cash used in investing activities and net expenditures for property and equipment both increased from 2010 to 2011 the increase was caused by the dramatic increase in the number of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment deployed in our business the net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from 2009 to 2010 however the net expenditures for property and equipment purchases less proceeds of disposals increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to expansions at our indianapolis indiana distribution center and increased spending for our fast solutions sm industrial vending 

property and equipment expenditures in 2011 2010 and 2009 consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center 2010 and 2009 8 cost of a new manufacturing facility for our holokrome business in wallingford connecticut 2010 9 purchases related to our fast solutions sm industrial vending which primarily consists of automated vending equipment and 10 cost related to the expansion of our winona minnesota distribution center 2011 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 

an estimate of our 2012 net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2011 and 2010 net capital expenditures is provided below as of year end we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 

we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and if necessary from our borrowing capacity in addition to opening new stores in the united states we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 

 

   

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 

 

 net cash used in financing activities – net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years and in the case of 2011 a reduction due to stock option exercises these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 

 

 stock repurchase — in july 2009 our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to 4000000 shares of our common stock this authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors during 2009 we purchased 2200000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately 1869 per share these purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 we did not purchase any stock in 2011 or 2010 as of february 9 2012 we have remaining authority to purchase up to 1800000 additional shares of our common stock 

dividends — we declared a dividend of 017 per share on january 17 2012 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 065 062 and 036 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

line of credit — we have an 8000 line of credit under which 0 was outstanding at year end the line bears interest at 09 over the libor rate we do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line 

effects of inflation— we noted minimal price changes in 2011 and 2010 price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009 

critical accounting policies— our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 

inventory reserve – this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends the analysis includes inventory levels sales information physical inventory counts cycle count adjustments and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

health insurance reserve – this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

general insurance reserve – this reserve is for general claims related to workers’ compensation property and casualty losses and other selfinsured losses the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

tax strategies – our effective income tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish income tax reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201106 comprehensive income topic 820 this accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements it also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented this accounting standard update is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012 

in august 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment this update approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount we adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

proposed accounting pronouncements 

in recent exposure drafts the international accounting standards board iasb and the fasb proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases from a lessee’s perspective the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and financecapital leases in its place a rightofuse model would be used this proposal as currently written would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments this would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized this exposure draft is not yet finalized however we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased and those leases are accounted for as operating leases

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

 

  

  

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our assessment and those criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 there was no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business tableend note – information in this section is as of year end december 31 2010 and also sometimes 2009 when indicated unless otherwise noted 

fastenal company together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 we had 2490 store locations at year end the various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later 

globally we employed 13285 people as of year end we characterize their roles as follows 

 

 we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document 

we operated 14 distribution centers in north america as of year end from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

at year end we operated the following number of store locations 

 

 we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction beginning in 2007 we disclosed our intention to continue opening new store locations at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year given the recent economic slowdown we decreased this range to 2 to 5 in 2009 this lower rate continued into the first half of 2010 from july 2010 to december 2010 we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 7 we expect to open 150 to 200 stores in 2011 or a rate of approximately 6 to 8 calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to a new opening store and district personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of selling locations the majority of our stores operate as a ‘fastenal store’ and stock our ‘standard inventory’ plus inventory unique to the local market during the 2002 to 2005 period this format was referred to as the csp or customer service project format the ‘csp project’ was a significant store remerchandising project during these years the first type of selling location – a store location can be further defined as either 1 a ‘traditional’ store which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of all the products we offer or 2 an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line this is the type of store format we have outside of north america 

in addition to the fastenal store type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and ‘inplant’ sites a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market because this location sells to multiple customers it is included in our store count a strategic account site is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store count an ‘inplant’ site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer ‘inplant’ sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store 

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

  

we opened the following stores in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 with approximately 72 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn of the 29 stores opened in the first quarter of 2010 14 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2009 to 2010 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately 22040 or approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2010 

 

  

  at year end we operated eleven distribution centers in the united states – minnesota indiana ohio pennsylvania texas georgia washington california utah north carolina and kansas and three outside the united states – ontario canada alberta canada and nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 26 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

our information systems department develops implements and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks see table below we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners™  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

  

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 and approximately 45 45 and 46 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

  we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and 

  

triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2010 approximately 94 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 6 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 1121000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2010 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading ‘item 8 financial statements and supplementary data’ foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2010 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 362000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2010 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we use include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

  

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price convenience and product availability 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see ‘employees’ below 

employees 

at year end we employed a total of 13285 full and parttime employees most of whom were employed at a store location a breakout of the number of employees and their respective roles is contained earlier in this document 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible our goal is to ‘promote from within’ for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk was demonstrated during the last several years as the economic condition in north america weakened significantly in the fall of 2008 and 2009 our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those periods a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves could adversely impact our business 

interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs andor decreases in revenues 

the proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters power losses unauthorized access telecommunication failures and other problems if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable our ability to process orders maintain proper levels of inventories collect accounts receivable pay expenses and maintain the security of the company and customer data could be adversely affected 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the united states canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth in part is dependent primarily on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores in 2007 and 2008 our business strategy focused on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year although the economic slowdown in the latter four months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2 to 5 for 2009 we opened stores at an annualized rate of 7 in the second half of 2010 we expect to open approximately 6 to 8 new stores in 2011 failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

our current business strategy ‘pathwaytoprofit’ which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add outside sales personnel to existing stores has not yet proven successful on a longterm basis 

in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy this strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional outside sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax earnings at the time we introduced this strategy we believed that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we could grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pretax earnings as a percent of net sales from 18 to 23 the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by temporarily slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2 to 5 and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing because of this economic setback we have indicated that the time required to achieve our pretax earnings percentage goals for ‘pathway to profit’ could be delayed 24 to 30 months more recently we have indicated we believe we could hit our pretax earnings percentage goal with less than the 125 thousand per month figure cited above we now believe the pretax earnings goal might be accomplished with average store sales as low as 100 to 110 thousand per month this could shorten the extended time line however we cannot assure this will occur a more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected the prospect of future economic deterioration difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified outside sales personnel reduced profitability from that currently experienced in the various categories of store sales size and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve desired pretax earnings results 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

changes in our customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins in addition gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

  

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and product lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend a discussion of our policies with respect to legal proceedings is discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis and our legal proceedings and other loss contingencies as described in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements the description of our legal proceedings in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements to this filing is incorporated herein by reference 

in july 2010 we received a letter from the civil division of the department of justice the ‘doj’ advising that they intended to be ready to commence litigation against us regarding a contract we entered into with the united states general services administration the ‘gsa’ in 2000 we discontinued the gsa contract in 2005 the letter is related to an audit conducted by the gsa office of inspector general the ‘oig’ in 200506 that suggested we had not complied with certain pricing and product requirement provisions and had potentially overcharged government customers under the contract we communicated our disagreement with the audit report and participated in several meetings and discussions with the oig and doj on these disputed issues during the past several years a subpoena dated march 25 2010 was sent to us from the doj seeking information about the company’s position concerning our compliance under the contract and we provided responsive information to the doj in may 2010 discussions between the doj and fastenal relating to our compliance with the pricing and product requirement provisions under the contract continued as of june 30 2010 the doj had offered to resolve this matter for a payment by us of 95 million and we had offered 750 thousand our offer was accrued as of june 30 2010 during the third quarter of 2010 we continued our discussions with the doj the doj modified their offer to settle to 85 million and we increased our offer to 275 million our new offer was accrued as of september 30 2010 during the fourth quarter of 2010 we met with the doj in a nonbinding mediation event this mediation and the discussions that followed concluded with a 625 million settlement we chose to settle this matter to 1 avoid a protracted legal dispute with the doj the outcome of which could include settlement or civil litigation by the doj to recover among other amounts treble damages and penalties under the false claims act and 2 because we felt a continuation of our dispute with the doj and gsa was not the best use of our resources despite this settlement we continue to believe that we complied with our obligations under the gsa contract in all material respects 

  

in early february 2010 we received a letter from a california fastener supplier dated january 26 2010 this letter threatened to sue us for an alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations in addition to the letter this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim shortly after receipt of this letter we performed a preliminary internal review to understand 1 who this supplier was and 2 the nature of our relationship with this supplier based on that review we determined that this supplier manufactures a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by us from all suppliers over the purported term of the alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener did not exceed 1 million following completion of our preliminary internal review we requested additional information and documentation from the supplier the supplier’s response failed to provide the requested information and documentation by letter dated february 26 2010 we quantified for the supplier our total volume of purchases as discussed above and informed the supplier that we believed their claim was grossly exaggerated and completely unsupported we have not received any direct response to our february 26 2010 letter on may 3 2010 this supplier filed suit in arkansas federal court alleging damages in response we filed a motion to dismiss this motion to dismiss was denied on august 16 2010 it is too early to determine how this case will progress based on current information we believe the prospect that we will incur a material liability as a result of this claim is remote while we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of the securities and exchange commission ‘sec’ we initially disclosed the existence of this threat in february 2010 in our 2009 annual report on form 10k as we believed that disclosure was prudent due to the alleged amount 180 million of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

  

business and operational overview 

fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2500 company owned stores most of our customers are in the manufacturing and nonresidential construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the nonresidential construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our product include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 

like most industrial and construction centric organizations we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years the third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices approximately 50 of our sales consist of some type of fastener – nuts bolts screws etc – most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america in one of our over 5000 vehicles on the road 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout much of 2009 this inflation turned to deflation when the swings are dramatic this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices this hurt our gross margins in 2009 the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation the deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to partially recover in 2010 see later discussion on gross margins 

the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2010 this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year however we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market information that follow – they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 

as always the ‘pathway to profit’ is the cornerstone of our business evolution and it influences everything we do remember our business centers on our 2500 stores – their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time as you read the balance of this discussion you will see our stores were able to make great strides in their endeavor to dig out of the economic hole known as 2009 we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service  

sales growth 

net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 

 

 the increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008 the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holokrome business which we acquired in december 2009 these two items added approximately 07 and 05 percentage points respectively to our growth in 2010 

the decrease in net sales in 2009 came primarily from lower unit sales the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes particularly in our steel based products our sales change in 2009 was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services the lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years the decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in 2008 and the first part of 2009 

  

the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows 2010 group – opened 2000 and earlier 2009 group – opened 1999 and earlier and 2008 group – opened 1998 and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier and 2008 group – opened 2003 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business store sites opened as follows 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier 2009 group – opened 2007 and earlier and 2008 group – opened 2006 and earlier the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows 

 

 note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 

stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately 22040 or 10 to 2010 net sales stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately 52737 or 23 to 2010 net sales and approximately 15172 or 08 to 2009 net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

sales by product line 

the approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows 

 

 comments regarding monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance 

note – daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period 

this section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes sequential trends and end market performance the discussion of monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores the discussion of sales trends provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business since the market deteriorated late in 2008 finally we believe the discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 

monthly sales changes 

stores opened greater than five years – the impact of the economy over time is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than five years store sites opened as follows 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier and 2008 group – opened 2003 and earlier this store group is more cyclical due to the increased market share these stores enjoy in their local markets during each of the twelve months in 2010 2009 and 2008 the stores opened greater than five years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

   

stores opened greater than two years – our stores opened greater than two years store sites opened as follows 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier 2009 group – opened 2007 and earlier and 2008 group – opened 2006 and earlier represent a consistent ‘samestore’ view of our business during each of the twelve months in 2010 2009 and 2008 the stores opened greater than two years had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

 all company sales – during each of the twelve months in 2010 2009 and 2008 all of our selling locations combined had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year 

 

 the improvement in 2010 generally continues the trend we saw in the latter half of 2009 the slowdown in the final three months of 2008 and all of 2009 relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace 

several additional factors positively impacted our sales growth in 2010 1 the strengthening canadian dollar when compared to the united states dollar added approximately 07 percentage points to our daily sales growth and 2 our holokrome business which we acquired in december 2009 added approximately 05 percentage points to our daily sales growth 

sequential trends 

we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway – this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in both 2009 and 2010 the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas  new year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

  

the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales the line labeled ‘past’ is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003 we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics a weaker industrial economy in north america and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line the ‘2009’ and ‘2010’ lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes the ‘09delta’ line is the difference between the ‘past’ and ‘2009’ similarly the ‘10delta’ is the difference between the ‘past’ and ‘2010’ 

 

  

 the 183 drop from october 2008 to january 2009 represents the immediate impact of the economy on our business during this time frame our daily sales change on a yearoveryear basis dropped from 119 growth in october to a contraction of 85 in january after january the trend continued downward as the ‘delta’ or spread between the benchmark and the 2009 actual in february march and april 2009 averaged a negative 49 the daily sales contraction on a yearoveryear basis was 210 in april the ‘delta’ from may 2009 to july 2009 was not as significant averaging a negative 10 while this period was still painful it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop finally in the period from august 2009 to december 2009 the ‘delta’ improved and averaged a positive 07 during 2010 sales have been strong  our business exceeded the trend line in january whereas february took a step back due to inclement weather and march reestablished the trend of being at or above the trend line see graph below 

a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above starting with a base of ‘100’ in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

end market performance 

fluctuations in end market business – the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets to place this in perspective – approximately 50 of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 

 

 the 2010 growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and less pronounced in the maintenance 

  

portion of our manufacturing business this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing the 2009 contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business 

our nonresidential construction customers have historically represented 20 to 25 of our business the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first second third and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year and for the year as follows 

 

 on a sequential basis the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in may 2009 and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms this reversed the negative trend which began in october 2008 this stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our nonresidential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of 2009 and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 

a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2008 2009 and 2010 starting with a base of ‘100’ in the previous october and ending with the next october would be as follows 

  

pathway to profit and its impact on our business 

during april 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business – for most of the preceding ten years we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately 14 new stores each year as announced in april 2007 we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7 to 10 per year see our disclosure below regarding the temporary slowing of our store growth in 2009 and 2010 our goal was fourfold 1 to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model 2 to grow the sales of our average store to 125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012 3 to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow resulting in a growth of our pretax earnings to 23 of net sales by 2012 and 4 to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average sales volume per store increases the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the ‘pathway to profit’ beginning in 2009 these changes centered on two aspects 1 temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of 2 to 5 per year and 2 temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing see later discussion on future store openings 

one side benefit of the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative described above is a slow altering of our cost structure over the last several years to increase the portion of our operating costs that are variable versus fixed this dramatically improved our ability to manage through the economic environment of the last two years as discussed in our third quarter 2009 earnings release we began to stabilize our store headcount in october 2009 from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010 we grew our store average fulltime equivalent fte headcount from 7007 to 7611 or 86 see later discussion on store count and fte numbers by quarter 

the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business 1 store headcount 2 store or unit growth and 3 average sales volume per store which ultimately drive our level of profitability our original goal was to hit the 125 thousand per month store average and grow our pretax earnings to 23 of net sales by 2012 we previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by 2430 months however as described below we have now modified our thinking regarding our pretax earnings goals 

during 2010 we modified our thought process around the ‘pathway to profit’ in two regards 1 we have structurally lowered our cost structure and believe we can hit our profitability target in the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative with average store sales of 100  110 thousand per month by 2013 see evidence of this in our ‘store size and profitability’ table later in this document and 2 we decided to hire fewer storebased people and instead added resources focused on specific opportunities such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists manufacturing government industry focused and automated solutions 

future store openings – in july 2010 we indicated our intentions to open 80 to 95 new stores during the second half of 2010 or an annualized rate of 68 to 80 during the second half of 2010 we opened 82 stores in 2011 we intend to open 150 to 200 new stores or an annualized rate of 60 to 80 

  

store count and fulltime equivalent fte headcount – because of our ‘pathway to profit’ we increased both our store count opening 75 and 81 new stores in calendar 2008 and 2007 respectively and our store fte headcount in 2007 and 2008 however the rate of increase in store locations slowed we opened 54 and 30 new stores in calendar 2010 and 2009 respectively and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008 the number of stores at quarter end the average headcount at our stores per quarter the average fte headcount per quarter and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the ‘pathway to profit’ for the third quarter of 2008 our peak quarter before the economy weakened and for each of the last five quarters 

 

  

 we have reduced our average fte headcount at our store locations 81 since our peak of 8280 average fte headcount in the third quarter of 2008 much of this decrease relates to a reduction in parttime hours worked as our average absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel declined by 08 during this time period 

  

store size and profitability – the store groups listed in the table below when combined with our strategic account stores represented approximately 88 87 and 88 of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market our remaining sales approximately 12 13 and 12 respectively relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 our direct fastenal cold heading business including our holokrome business acquired in december 2009 or 3 our direct import business our average store had sales of 67600 58100 and 70200 per month in the fourth quarter of 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this average amount was 71600 per month in the first quarter of 2007 the last completed quarter before we began the ‘pathway to profit’ the average age number of stores and pretax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively were as follows 

 

 note – amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 

our original intent under the ‘pathway to profit’ was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately 125000 per month see earlier discussion in order to meet our pretax earnings profitability goal this would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity our goal today is to continue 1 to grow the business and 2 to grow our pretax earnings as a percent of net sales as stated earlier we now believe based on the profitability improvements noted in the previous table that we can hit our pretax earnings percent goal of 23 with average store sales of approximately 100000 – 110000 per month

 the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by 1 transactional gross profit 2 organizational gross profit and 3 vendor incentive gross profit the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized due to the daytoday fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs this component was negatively influenced by the competitive landscape in 2009 which depressed the prices we could charge for our products this component has generally improved since august 2009 except for customer mix which is discussed later the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains this component was negatively influenced by deflationary impacts in 2009 as we were selling inventory sourced at peak costs late in 2008 this component was magnified in 2009 due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year however this component improved in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2010 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 the third component relates to vendor volume allowances the gross profit dollars associated with this component dropped dramatically in the second half of 2009 however this component improved in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2010 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 in our second quarter 2010 earnings release we indicated our belief that the first two components would continue to improve as we progress into the remainder of 2010 this belief was based on 1 our focused effort to raise our transactional margin and 2 the bias which we believed existed for some inflation in 2010 rather than the significant deflation we experienced in 2009 in the third quarter of 2010 our assumptions about the latter half of the year were proven wrong and these two components had a negative impact on gross profit percentage we continued to struggle with the first component in the fourth quarter but did see some improvement in the second component due to the expansion of inventory depth which decreased the need for ‘fill in’ shortterm purchases to ‘fill in’ an empty shelf because normal procurement lead times do not meet demand buys which carry a cost premium the decrease in gross profit percentage from the second quarter of 2010 to the third and fourth quarters of 2010 was primarily caused by the strong growth of our industrial production business which resulted in a change in our overall business mix the industrial production business has a lower gross margin therefore the change in mix pulled our gross margin down however since the operating expenses of our industrial production business are lower operating income produced by that business is similar to our overall business the second cause was the relative lack of inflation in the third and fourth quarters finally as we indicated in our second quarter 2010 earnings release vendor volume allowances largely recovered during the second quarter to 

  

the levels in place in 2008 and in early 2009 due to the reset of vendor allowance programs which tend to be calendar based however the fourth quarter of 2010 did see some improvement in this category generally speaking the decline in the gross margin percentage from 2008 to 2009 was evenly split between a deterioration in the three components discussed earlier the improvement from 2009 to 2010 was primarily related to improvements in vendor incentive gross profit about half of the improvement and the balance primarily related to improvements in organizational gross profit and transactional gross profit 

operating and administrative expenses improved relative to sales in 2010 versus both 2009 and 2008 

historically 65 to 70 of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs the components are 1 payroll which includes cash compensation stock option expense and profit sharing 2 health care and 3 education during 2009 this range had reduced to 60 to 65 due to the factors noted below during 2010 this range moved back to the historical level 

the two largest components of employee related costs grewcontracted as follows 

 

 the two largest components of operating and administrative expenses outside of the employee related costs grewcontracted as follows 

 

 the 2010 disparity between the fulltime equivalent headcount increase of 103 noted earlier and the 167 annual increase in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors 1 sales commissions earned grew this increase was amplified by the sales growth and the gross margin expansion both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned 2 total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth 3 hours worked per employee grew and 4 our profit sharing contribution grew these four items when compared to 2009 all grew at a rate faster than the rate of sales growth 

the 2009 disparity between the fulltime equivalent headcount decrease of 152 noted earlier and the 183 annual decrease in payroll costs noted above is driven by several factors 1 sales commissions earned contracted this decrease was amplified by the sales contraction and the gross margin contraction both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned 2 total bonuses earned decreased due to our profit contraction 3 hours worked per employee contracted and 4 our profit sharing contribution was reduced to zero these four items when compared to 2008 all contracted at a rate faster than the rate of sales contraction 

our health care costs in 2010 decreased from the unusual peak in 2009 health care costs in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 increased due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers increases in cobra costs due to changes in federal funding within cobra and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years these conditions still exist in the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 however the spike in costs in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 changed the comparison on a two year basis our health care costs are still up significantly despite a decrease in headcount 

  

the two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation occupancy expenses increased from 2009 to 2010 and increased from 2008 to 2009 the annual increase in occupancy expense was driven by 1 increases in utilities 2 increases in taxes 3 new store locations 4 expansions to our indianapolis and dallas distribution centers and 5 in the case of 2010 our new holokrome facilities the selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses decreased in both years due to 1 fleet reductions 2 moderating fuel costs and 3 in the case of 2010 improvements in the resale market for used fleet pickup prices 

the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline – during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2010 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 64 million 68 million 66 million and 71 million respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2009 our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately 52 million 57 million 62 million and 61 million respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers and changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store use 

the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a yearoveryear basis for the last three years was as follows 

 

 loss on sale of property and equipment – the loss on sale of property and equipment for 2010 and 2009 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 

income taxes – incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 384 380 and 380 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this rate fluctuates over time based on 1 the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 2 the level of profits in those jurisdictions and 3 changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

  

net earnings – net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 

 

 during 2010 the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth during 2009 the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion during 2008 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses the eps percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2007 2008 and 2009 

working capital – two components of working capital accounts receivable and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 

 

 these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital these initiatives include 1 the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in 2005 and 2 the disciplined management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory new expanded inventory inventory necessary for upcoming store openings or inventory necessary for our ‘master stocking hubs’ 

the accounts receivable increase of 261 from 2009 to 2010 was created by a daily sales increase of 179 and 209 in november and december 2010 respectively the increase in accounts receivable was greater than the increase in daily sales this was primarily driven by the significant growth in both our national account large customer business and in our international business both of which typically pay slower than our remaining business the accounts receivable decrease of 126 from 2008 to 2009 relates to a daily sales decrease of 120 and 86 in november and december 2009 respectively 

a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends therefore the drop in sales growth activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 and during the first two months of 2009 resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product the inventory decrease began in march 2009 and continued through most of 2009 our inventory dropped approximately 9000 36000 and 21000 during the first second and third quarters of 2009 respectively the inventory grew by approximately 10000 in the 

  

fourth quarter of 2009 approximately half of this increase related to our december 2009 acquisition of holokrome and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends seen since august 2009 during 2010 our inventory decreased approximately 1000 in the first quarter and increased approximately 15000 24000 and 11000 in the second third and fourth quarters respectively or a 49000 increase yeartodate this was disappointing to us however the expanding sales trends noted earlier in this discussion overshadowed the disappointment in its most simplified view our expanding inventories are directly related to 1 the expanding sales growth trends with emphasis on our large account business – both oem  mro 2 our confidence in their sustainability and 3 an increase in the rate of store openings 

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari back to a better than a 301 ratio on december 31 2010 and 2009 we had a ratio of 271 

acquisition – on december 18 2009 we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener the business had an established name ‘holokrome’ and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees the business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the ‘all cash’ acquisition as noted in our cash flow statement the acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2010 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales the 2009 and 2008 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 

the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december 31 

 

 new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 50 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities — net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

   

property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from 2009 to 2010 the net expenditures for property and equipment purchases less proceeds of disposals increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to increases for expansions at our indianapolis indiana distribution center and related to increased spending for our fastenal automated solutions technology which primarily consists of automated vending equipment the 2009 decrease in investing activities from 2008 is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures this was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in 2009 of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis indiana and the relocation of our dallas texas distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of shortterm marketable securities in 2009 the 2008 increase in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis indiana and the relocation of our dallas texas distribution center noted above 

property and equipment expenditures in 2010 2009 and 2008 consist of 1 purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 addition of certain pickup trucks 3 purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 cost related to the relocation of our new dallas texas distribution center 2008 8 cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center 2008 2009 and 2010 9 cost of a new manufacturing facility in rockford illinois 2008 10 cost of a new manufacturing facility for our holokrome business in wallingford connecticut 2010 and 11 purchases related to our fastenal automated solutions technology which primarily consists of automated vending equipment 2009 and 2010 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and in the case of 2008 the disposal of our former dallas texas distribution center 

an estimate of our 2011 net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2010 net capital expenditures is provided below as of year end we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 

we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and if necessary from our borrowing capacity in addition to opening new stores in the united states we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 

 

   

we have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end the facility and vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments the expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 

 

 net cash used in financing activities — net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 

 

 stock repurchase — in july 2009 our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to 2000000 shares of our common stock this authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors during 2009 we purchased 1100000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately 3737 per share these purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 we did not purchase any stock in 2010 as of february 9 2011 we have remaining authority to purchase up to 900000 additional shares of our common stock 

dividends — we declared a dividend of 050 per share on january 17 2011 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 124 072 and 079 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

line of credit — we have an 8000 line of credit under which 0 was outstanding at year end the line bears interest at 09 over the libor rate we do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line 

effects of inflation — we noted minimal price changes in 2010 price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009 price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008 

critical accounting policies — our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts – this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable writeoffs the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable the financial condition of a customer or industry and general economic conditions historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 

inventory reserve – this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends the analysis includes inventory levels sales information physical inventory counts cycle count adjustments and the onhand quantities relative to the sales history for the product historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

health insurance reserve – this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

general insurance reserve – this reserve is for general claims related to workers’ compensation property and casualty losses and other selfinsured losses the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends historically results have reflected the reserves previously recorded we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 

tax strategies – our effective income tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish income tax reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201006 improving disclosures about fair value measurements this update requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fairvalue measurements and provides clarification of existing disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis the asu requires disclosure of significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 and transfers into and out of level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers significant transfers into each level must be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level significance is judged with respect to earnings total assets total liabilities or total equity an accounting policy must be determined and disclosed as to when transfers between levels are recognized 1 actual date 2 beginning of period or 3 end of period the asu amends the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of level 3 recurring fair value measurements to present information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as a net number the asu amends accounting standards codification asc 820 to require fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of the valuation technique and inputs used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements this standard became effective in 2010 except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases sales issuances and settlement on a gross basis which will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2011 since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201009 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements this update amends guidance on subsequent events this amendment removes the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events however the datedisclosure exemption does not relieve management of an sec filer from its responsibility to evaluate subsequent events through the date on which financial statements are issued this standard became effective in the first quarter of 2010 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

proposed accounting pronouncements 

in recent exposure drafts the international accounting standards board iasb and the fasb proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases from a lessee’s perspective the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and financecapital leases in its place a rightofuse model would be used this proposal as currently written would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments this would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized this exposure draft is not yet finalized however we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased and those leases are accounted for as operating leases

 item 1 business tableend fastenal company together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or the company or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2009 we had 2369 store locations located in the united states 50 states puerto rico canada 10 provinces mexico 25 states singapore china the netherlands hungary and malaysia and employed 8491 people at these store locations in addition there were 3554 people employed in various support positions these support roles consisted of distribution and manufacturing 2187 people and administrative and sales support 1367 people 

we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2009 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below 

we operated 14 distribution centers in north america as of december 31 2009 from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations 

our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

as of december 31 we operated store locations in 

 

 we have closed 29 stores in our history and of these locations we subsequently reopened in six of these markets when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved profitability of stores in these markets of the remaining 23 closed stores 21 of these stores have a store located within ten miles of the originally closed store location 

we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction historically we have disclosed that we intend to continue opening new store locations and expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year given the recent economic slowdown we decreased this range to 2 to 5 in 2009 but we expect to return to the 7 to 10 rate of annual openings in the latter half of 2010 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to opening store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of store locations the majority of our stores operate as a ‘fastenal store’ and stock our ‘expected inventory’ format during the 2002 to 2005 period this format was referred to as the csp or customer service project format the ‘csp project’ was a significant store remerchandising project during these years 

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

in addition to the fastenal store type discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and “inplant” sites a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers and we include these in our store count a strategic account site is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store count an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer “inplant” sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

  

we opened the following stores in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 8 of our consolidated net sales in 2009 with approximately 72 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn of the 33 stores opened in the first quarter of 2009 11 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

the data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2008 to 2009 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately 15172 or approximately 08 of our consolidated net sales in 2009 with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2009 

 

  

  as of december 31 2009 we operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania modesto california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah greensboro north carolina kansas city kansas toronto ontario canada edmonton alberta canada and monterrey nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 26 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

our information systems department is responsible for developing implementing and maintaining computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks including fastenal® fasnit® fnl® blackstone® rock river® blue global® fastenal racing® fnl g9® equiprite™ clean choice® bodyguard™ profitter® dynaflo™ fmt™ tritan™ caliber™ powerphase™ and as of december 19 2009 holokrome® we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ™ although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

  

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 and approximately 45 46 and 46 of our consolidated net sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

 we plan to continue to add other products in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from different geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

  

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2009 approximately 945 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 55 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 996000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2009 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2009 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 356000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2009 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we use include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service price and convenience 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order websites or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see “employees” below 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed a total of 12045 full and parttime employees 8491 of whom were employed at a store location 2187 of whom were employed in one of our distribution centers manufacturing operations or service operations and the remaining 1367 of whom were employed at one of our administrative support facilities or home office 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within our organization for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business our internal corporate university program develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all fastenal employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of among other things gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined departmental project and cost containment goals 

none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which has harmed and could continue to harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of profitability 

this risk has come to bear during the last four months of 2008 and all of 2009 as the economic condition in north america has weakened significantly our customers which operate principally in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors have experienced a pronounced slowdown that has adversely impacted our sales and operating results a lag in these sectors even as the general economy improves would continue to adversely impact our business 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth in part is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year although the economic slowdown in the latter 4 months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2 to 5 for 2009 we anticipate returning to our historical rate of 7 to 10 in the second half of 2010 failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

our current business strategy ‘pathwaytoprofit’ which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add outside sales personnel to existing stores has not yet proven successful on a longterm basis 

in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy this strategy involves slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional outside sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax operating margin at the time we introduced this strategy we believed that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we could grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pretax operating margin from 18 to 23 the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by temporarily slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2 to 5 and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing because of this economic setback we believe that the time required to achieve our goals for ‘pathway to profit’ will be delayed 24 to 30 months however we cannot assure even these delayed results a more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected the prospect of future economic deterioration difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified outside sales personnel and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve desired pretax earnings results 

changes in customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in volume of orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

changes in our customer or product mix downward pressure on sales prices and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins in addition gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition as was the case in 2009 furthermore reductions in our volume of purchases as also happened in 2009 can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal’s name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

  

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and products lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend a discussion of our policies with respect to legal proceedings is discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis and our legal proceedings and other loss contingencies as described in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements the description of our legal proceedings in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements to this filing is incorporated herein by reference 

on october 18 2007 a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against fastenal on behalf of two former employees claiming to represent all employees employed in the store position of assistant general manager in the united states within three years prior to the filing date four years for california employees the suit alleged fastenal misclassified its assistant general managers as exempt for purposes of the overtime provisions of the fair labor standards act and california oregon and pennsylvania state statutes this suit also alleged that assistant general managers in california did not receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods under the california labor code an optin class was certified for this action 

on august 29 2008 we issued a press release announcing a preliminary agreement to settle the class action lawsuit noted above while we deny the allegations underlying the lawsuit we agreed to enter into the settlement agreement in order to avoid significant legal fees the uncertainty of a jury trial distractions to our operations and other expenses and management time that would have to be devoted to protracted litigation the settlement which received court approval in 2009 fully resolves all claims brought by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit pursuant to the settlement we made a cash payment of 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to cover claims by eligible class members plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs and payments to the named plaintiffs and their attorneys the expense for this settlement was recorded in the third quarter of 2008 we do not expect the settlement to have any material impact on our operating results going forward 

  

in early february 2010 we received a letter from a fastener supplier dated january 26 2010 this letter threatened to sue us for our alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations in addition this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim we have performed a preliminary internal review during the last several days to understand 1 who this supplier is and 2 the nature of our relationship with this supplier while we have had only a limited time to investigate this matter we have determined that this supplier manufacturers a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by us from all suppliers over the purported term of this alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener does not exceed 1 million based on our preliminary inquiry we believe it is remote that this claim would have a material adverse impact on our financial position cash flow or results of operations while we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of the sec we believe that disclosure is prudent due to the alleged amount of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form 10k certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding 

business overview – fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we operate stores primarily located in north america on december 31 2009 we operated 2369 companyowned or leased store locations 

most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our customers are primarily located in north america 

  

similar to our first three quarterly reports in 2009 this annual report’s discussion contains some additional points not typically covered in our reports in previous years we believe these are important aspects that require added emphasis 

as we saw in the previous fifteen months the weakened economy continues to have a substantial impact on our business these impacts continue to negatively affect our sales particularly related to our industrial production business business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by others and as the year progressed our nonresidential construction business to place this in perspective – sales to our manufacturing customers historically approximately 50 of sales contracted approximately 101 in the fourth quarter and 188 for the year versus the same periods in 2008 this contraction is less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing sales business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing but more severe in the production business our nonresidential construction business historically 20 to 25 of sales contracted approximately 247 in the fourth quarter and 194 for the year versus the same periods in 2008 the remaining business sales to other resellers government business transportationwarehousing other industries and instore retail sales produced better results as a group but unfortunately doesn’t have enough impact to offset the manufacturing and construction impact the annual 2009 sales growthcontraction compared to 2008 sales for the remaining business was as follows sales to other resellers – 26 contraction government business – 16 growth transportationwarehousing – 3 contraction all other industries combined – 0 growth and instore retail sales – 14 contraction 

on a sequential basis our daily average sales to our manufacturing customers improved each month since may 2009 with the exception of july and december 2009 due to the holiday impact versus the previous month this trend was the first sequential improvement since september 2008 however this improvement was partially offset by continued weakening in our nonresidential construction business 

sometimes our comments are an effort to share our perspective regarding the trends with you our shareholder the discussion above is an attempt to provide insight into activities with types of customers and the discussion under the headings ‘financial overview’ and ‘monthly daily sales change’ later gives a somewhat mechanical view of our business another way to think about our business is to compare our growth during a year to the act of climbing a stairway this stairway has several predictable landings ie april july and october to december but generally speaking climbs from january to october the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

history has identified these landings in our business cycle they generally relate to months with impaired business days ie certain holidays the first landing centers on easter which alternates between march and april it was in april in 2009 the second landing centers on july 4 th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and on the christmas  new year holidays the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from monthtomonth or because they move around during the week 

the table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales see definition of daily sales later in this report the line labeled ‘past’ is an historical average of the results for the period 1998 to 2003 we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics a weaker industrial economy in north america and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line the ‘2009’ line is our actual results and the ‘delta’ line is the difference between the ‘past’ and ‘2009’ 

 

  

   

in the october 2008 to january 2009 time frame our economy dug a big hole and pulled our sales results from daily average sales growth of 119 in october to a contraction of 85 in january the ‘delta’ or spread between the benchmark and the 2009 actual in the february 2009 to april 2009 time frame averaged a negative 50 this increased the daily sales contraction to 210 in april the ‘delta’ from may 2009 to july 2009 was not as significant averaging a negative 11 while this period was still painful it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop finally in the period from august 2009 to december 2009 the ‘delta’ improved further and averaged a positive 07 historically we are hesitant to provide much forward looking commentary as we believe we are better able to provide value to our shareholders by managing the business and not by trying to predict the economy however our confidence in our ability to see yearoveryear sales growth in the near future is buoyed by these trends 

during 2009 we attempted to balance longterm opportunities for growth with the necessary shortterm reactions to the current reality in this regard we previously slowed our store openings for 2009 to a range of 2 to 5 new stores and we stopped adding any headcount except for store openings and for stores that are growing over the last several years our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative has slowly altered our cost structure in that a greater portion is now variable versus fixed this continues to help us today as we navigate through the current economic environment as discussed in our third quarter report we began to stabilize our store total headcount in that quarter and in october 2009 we began the steps to increase our rate of store openings assuming our confidence continues to be supported by an economy that is stable we plan to continue increasing the rate of store openings as we did in the fourth quarter of 2009 with the goal of resuming our historical rate of openings of 7 to 10 in the second half of 2010 this plan allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business 1 average store size which ultimately drives our level of profitability 2 store headcount and 3 store or unit growth the last two drive our ability to grow our sales longterm 

our balance sheet continues to be very strong and our operations have good cash generating characteristics during 2009 we tried to manage it well during 2009 we generated 306070 or 1660 of net earnings of operating cash flow the comparable figure was 259898 or 929 of net earnings in 2008 our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments this benefit reverses itself in the second third and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in april june september and december the remaining amounts of cash flow from operating activities are largely linked to the pure dynamics of a distribution business and its strong correlation to working capital 

as we planned our capital expenditures for 2009 were down from 2008 this primarily related to the indianapolis in distribution expansion and to our new distribution center location near dallas tx most of the expenditures for these two locations occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009 as indicated in our 2008 annual report we expected our capital expenditures would drop from approximately 95000 in 2008 to 65000 in 2009 the actual 2009 figure came in at 52538 with the difference being driven by lower capital expenditures for computer software and equipment real estate and vehicles in 2010 we expect our capital expenditures will drop to approximately 40000 again this reduction is driven by a significant drop in expenditures for the aforementioned indianapolis and dallas facilities this reduction will be partially offset by some added spending for computer equipment and vehicles in 2010 and some potential real estate purchases for our manufacturing and distribution operations 

the strong free cash flow in 2009 operating cash flow less net capital expenditures allowed us to increase our first dividend payment declared january 2009 and paid in march 2009 by 40 from 25 per share in 2008 to 35 per share in 2009 this strong free cash flow also allowed us to increase our second dividend payment declared july 2009 and paid in august 2009 by 37 from 27 per share in 2008 to 37 per share in 2009 given the economic environment we are satisfied with our cash flow for 2009 as announced on january 18 2010 our board of directors declared a dividend of 40 per share to be paid in february 2010 this represents a 143 increase over our first dividend in 2009 

  

financial overview – during 2009 2008 and 2007 the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years 2009 group reflects stores opened in 1999 and earlier and opened greater than five years 2009 group reflects stores opened in 2004 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years 2009 group reflects stores opened in 2007 and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business the net sales change for each of the groups was as follows 

 

 net sales – net sales and percentage change in net sales were as follows 

 

 the 2009 2008 and 2007 percentage change in net sales reflect a weakening economy since late 2006 versus a strengthening economy from summer 2003 to late 2006 in the north american market the decrease in 2009 related to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace the increase in net sales in 2008 and 2007 came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years growth in our newer product lines and new store openings 

stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately 15172 or 08 to 2009 net sales stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately 74945 or 39 to 2009 net sales and approximately 31917 or 14 to 2008 net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

monthly daily sales change – our business had daily sales changes compared to the comparable month in the preceding year as follows 

 

 note daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period 

  

the growth in 2007 generally represents a weakening environment which began in late 2006 the final three months of 2007 continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 137 generally speaking this improvement in late 2007 remained in the first nine months of 2008 and weakened in the october 2008 to december 2008 time frame the slowdown in the final three months of 2008 and all of 2009 relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace note – see our discussion by customer type and about sequential trends earlier in this report 

impact of fuel prices – rising fuel prices negatively impacted 2007 and 2008 however we did feel some relief in the final months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 during the first second third and fourth quarter of 2009 our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately 17 million 19 million 21 million and 20 million per month respectively during the first second third and fourth quarter of 2008 our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately 29 million 37 million 37 million and 24 million per month respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs the freight initiative discussed below a reduction in sales volume and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support sales personnel and to support additional store locations these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store use 

in 2005 we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance the freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the fastenal trucking network which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units this initiative positively impacted our business over the last several years despite the increases in average per gallon fuel costs during several of those years the following table indicates changes in average per gallon fuel costs during 2007 2008 and 2009 

 

   

gross profit margins – gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows 

 

 gross profit margin percentage decreased from 2008 to 2009 the gross margin change was driven by different factors during 2009 versus 2008 historically our gross margins have been driven by several factors 1 a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin 2 a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost which can provide short term inflation margin 3 improvements in our direct sourcing operations 4 continued focus on our freight initiative discussed earlier and 5 continued focus on our product availability within our network this product availability focus centers on our ‘master stocking hub’ in indianapolis indiana and our efficient ability to pull product from storetostore however in 2009 the inflation margin noted in item 2 reversed from an inflation gain to a deflation loss as higher cost product purchased in 2008 which turned through our system slower than anticipated was sold against deflationary selling prices in 2009 and the competitive marketplace caused the margin on recently purchased product to drop due to added pressure on selling prices these two issues continued to worsen during the latter half of 2009 with august 2009 being the worst month the gross margin in 2009 was also impacted by reductions in vendor volume allowances due to the reductions in purchase volumes with our vendors relative to the prior year and due to our decision to purposely forego potential volume rebates in an effort to continue to aggressively manage our inventory levels we were disappointed by the 2009 decrease in gross margins however we believe the reasons noted above are shortterm in nature and we remain confident in our ability to improve gross margins in 2010 

gross profit margins for 2008 increased over 2007 the improvement was driven by the five historical factors noted above 

operating and administrative expenses – operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows 

 

 operating and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased 126 from 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by 1 payroll and related costs which contracted due to reduced headcount and due to decreased incentive compensation due to our sales and gross margin decline and 2 transportation costs which contracted due to decreasing fuel costs as the economy dramatically weakened in october 2008 we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth continued to weaken we were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 and all of 2009 operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 132 from the fourth quarter of 2008 

operating and administrative expenses in 2008 grew 170 over 2007 while this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of 135 at that time it represented the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history the growth was primarily driven by 1 payroll and related costs which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement 2 transportation costs which expanded due to rising fuel costs and 3 our legal settlement described earlier in this form 10k as indicated above the economy dramatically weakened in october 2008 therefore we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth we were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 grew 110 over the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

the operating and administrative expenses for 2009 include 3850 of compensation expense related to stock options during 2008 and 2007 this expense was 3247 and 1915 respectively the increase from 2008 to 2009 was driven by stock option grants in april 2009 and 2008 the options issued in 2007 2008 and 2009 vest over a five to eight year period we estimate the three option grants when combined will result in compensation expense of approximately 330 per month for the next four years dropping slightly in the remaining period no other stock options were outstanding during these periods 

payroll  related costs – payroll and related costs represented approximately 63 65 and 67 of operating and administrative expenses in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our net payroll cost for 2009 decreased approximately 183 from 2008 the disparity between the 108 fulltime equivalent headcount decline noted below from 2008 to 2009 and the 183 expense decline is driven by several factors 1 contractions in sales commissions earned 2 contractions in bonuses earned 3 reductions of hours worked per employee and of temporary labor and 4 a reduction of the profit sharing contribution earned the decrease was partially offset by the increase in stock option expense noted above and the increase in health care costs noted below as we have indicated in the past our regional leaders district managers store managers and other sales personnel are rewarded for among other things growth in sales gross profit dollars and pretax earnings the negative growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter and the year ended december 31 2009 when compared to the growth rates in the same periods of 2008 drove the contractions noted in 1 2 and 4 above our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased approximately 211 over the fourth quarter of 2008 

our net payroll cost for 2008 increased approximately 141 over 2007 our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased approximately 72 over the fourth quarter of 2007 the disparity between the 92 fulltime equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 72 expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of 2008 

in 2009 payroll and related costs decreased at a rate faster than net sales due to a decrease in our gross margin percentage from 2008 to 2009 see earlier discussion in 2008 payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year in 2007 payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively 

the following sets forth the average number of employees numbers are presented on a fulltime equivalent basis for each of 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

the rate of decrease in store personnel in 2009 was slower than the rate of change in sales due to 1 a 30 increase in the number of store locations and 2 our attempt to balance selling activities versus cost controls the rate of increase in store personnel in 2008 was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed below the decrease in ‘distribution and manufacturing’ and ‘administrative and sales support’ personnel from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 was amplified by the weak selling environment in 2009 but generally related to the tight management of headcount growth for these personnel since early 2007 when we first introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed elsewhere in this report the twoyear percentage change noted above was included to emphasize the impact of the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative on the relative changes between the different types of personnel 

two components of employee related costs did increase from 2008 to 2009 – health care costs and stock option expense the health care costs for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 524 from the fourth quarter of 2008 and 314 from the third quarter of 2009 for the year health care costs increased 241 the increase is due to rising health care costs and the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses have lost their insurance coverage at other employers due to the current economic environment our health benefits program is essentially a selfinsured plan and as the claim activity escalated during the year we were caught by surprise in the final four to five months of the year due to the magnitude of the increase with the benefit of hindsight we underestimated three factors 1 the impact of the shift in the mix of our participants noted above 2 the impact of the gap between the expenses associated with providing cobra benefits versus the funds received from the participants andor the federal government and 3 the increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years 

we were pleased with our organization’s ability to manage payroll and related costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately 5207 and 4743 in 2008 and 2007 respectively to our employees’ 401k plan accounts or registered retirement savings plan accounts in the case of our canadian employees unfortunately our operating results did not allow for a profit sharing contribution in 2009 

occupancy costs – occupancy costs represented approximately 204 173 and 184 of operating expenses in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively occupancy expenses grew approximately 31 from 2008 to 2009 the annual increase in occupancy was driven by a 25 net increase in the number of store locations which was partially offset by reductions in rent expense at existing stores by the relocation of approximately 4 of our stores and by the depreciation impact of our new or expanded facilities in dallas texas and indianapolis indiana occupancy expenses grew approximately 99 from 2007 to 2008 in 2008 we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade occupancy costs in 2008 and 2007 increased due to 1 a 75 and 81 net increase in the number of store locations in 2008 and 2007 respectively 2 the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative formerly referred to as csp and 3 the relocation of existing stores during 2008 and 2007 we relocated approximately 5 and 8 of our stores respectively 

transportation costs – transportation costs represented approximately 51 54 and 50 of operating expenses in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively net transportation costs decreased 183 from 2008 to 2009 the 2009 decrease was primarily driven by lower gasoline prices and by the stabilization in the sales price of our vehicles for sale 

in 2008 transportation was one component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful deleverage our transportation costs grew approximately 267 from 2007 to 2008 this increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force 

gain loss on sale of property plant and equipment – the loss on sale of property and equipment for 2009 and 2008 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles the 2008 number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our dallas texas distribution center 

income taxes – incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were approximately 380 380 and 384 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively this rate fluctuates over time based on 1 the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 2 the level of profits in those jurisdictions and 3 changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

  

net earnings – net earnings net earnings per share eps percentage change in net earnings and the percentage change in eps were as follows 

 

 during 2009 the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion during 2008 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses during 2007 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins the eps percentage change rate was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2007 2008 and 2009 

working capital – two components of working capital accounts receivable and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows 

 

 these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital these initiatives include 1 the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in 2005 and 2 the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory new expanded inventory inventory necessary for upcoming store openings or inventory necessary for our ‘master stocking hubs’ 

the accounts receivable decrease of 126 from december 2008 to december 2009 was the result of a daily sales decrease of 120 and 86 in november and december 2009 respectively the accounts receivable increase of 36 from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 relates to a daily sales increase of 68 and 00 in november and december 2008 respectively a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends therefore the drop in sales growth activity late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and during the first quarter of 2009 continued to result in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product with the exception of march 2009 the inventory decrease noted in march 2009 continued through most of 2009 our inventory dropped approximately 9000 36000 and 21000 during the first second and third quarters of 2009 respectively the inventory grew by approximately 10000 in the fourth quarter approximately half of this increase related to our december 2009 acquisition of holokrome discussed later and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends we have seen since august 2009 

  

as we indicated in earlier communications our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari back to a better than a 301 ratio on december 31 2009 and 2008 we had a ratio of 271 and 291 respectively 

pathway to profit – during april 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business for most of the last decade we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately 14 new stores each year as announced in april 2007 we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7 to 10 per year we opened approximately 30 75 and 81 new stores in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively see also our disclosure above regarding the expected rate of 2010 store openings at the time it was announced our goal with this strategy was fourfold 1 to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model 2 to grow the sales of our average store to 125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012 3 to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow and 4 to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average store size increases the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the ‘pathway to profit’ during 2009 these changes center on two aspects 1 temporarily slowing store openings to a range of 2 to 5 see earlier comments and 2 stopping headcount additions except for store openings and for stores that are growing see earlier comments we believe this economic setback will impact the timing of when we achieve the 125 thousand per month average by 24 to 30 months however the current economic weakness only serves to strengthen our belief in the ‘pathway to profit’ 

since first implementing the ‘pathway to profit’ we have increased our store count and our store fulltime equivalent fte head count however the rate of increase in store locations has slowed and fte headcount for all types of personnel has been reduced since the economy weakened late in 2008 the percentage change yearoveryear since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the number of stores at quarter end and in the average fte per quarter were as follows 

 

 while we have reduced our fte headcount at our store locations much of this relates to a reduction in parttime hours worked as our absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel have remained more stable we believe this allows us to manage our expense in the shortterm while maintaining our ability to sell into the marketplace the percentage change yearoveryear since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the absolute store personnel headcount at quarter end were as follows 

 

   

since march 2007 the month before announcing the ‘pathway to profit’ and december 2009 our absolute headcount and fte headcount have changed as follows 

 

 store size and profitability – the store groups listed in the table below when combined with our strategic account stores represented approximately 87 to 89 of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 2008 and 2007 strategic account stores which numbered 27 20 and 14 in the fourth quarter of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market our remaining sales approximately 11 to 13 in the fourth quarter of 2009 2008 and 2007 relate to either 1 our inplant locations 2 our direct fastenal cold heading business including our new holokrome business discussed under ‘acquisition’ below or 3 our direct import business our average store excluding the business not sold through a store had sales of 58100 70200 and 72500 per month in the fourth quarter of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the average age number of stores and pretax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively were as follows 

three months ended december 31 2009 

 

 three months ended december 31 2008 

 

   

three months ended december 31 2007 

 

 as we indicated earlier in this report our goal is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately 125000 per month this will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 and we believe will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 

note – dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars not thousands 

acquisition – on december 18 2009 we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener the business has an established name ‘holokrome’ and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees we believe this business will be a good addition to serving the needs of our customers the business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the ‘all cash’ acquisition as noted in our cash flow statement the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall sales in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2009 2008 and 2007 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 

the percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december 31 

 

 new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 62 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

  

net cash used in investing activities — net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2009 decrease in investing activities from 2008 is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures this was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in 2009 of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis indiana and the relocation of our dallas texas distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of shortterm marketable securities in 2009 

the 2008 increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis indiana and the relocation of our dallas texas distribution center noted above 

property and equipment expenditures in 2009 2008 and 2007 consist of 1 the purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 the addition of certain pickup trucks 3 the purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 the expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 the cost related to the relocation of our new dallas texas distribution center 2007 and 2008 8 the cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center 2008 and 2009 and 9 the cost of a new manufacturing facility in rockford illinois 2008 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and in the case of 2008 the disposal of our former dallas texas distribution center 

we expect to incur approximately 40000 in total capital expenditures in 2010 consisting of approximately 11000 for manufacturing warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities 5000 for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and ‘a la carte’ store expansions 11000 for data processing equipment 10000 for real estate and improvement to store buildings and 3000 for vehicles we have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future as of december 31 2009 we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 

we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and if necessary from our borrowing capacity in addition to opening new stores in the united states we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 

  

we have future commitments for leased facilities and for leased vehicles at december 31 2009 the future contractual cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 

 

 net cash used in financing activities – net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years these items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows 

 

 stock repurchase — on july 10 2009 we issued a press release announcing our board of directors had authorized purchases by us of up to 2000000 shares of our common stock this authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors during 2009 we purchased 1100000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately 3737 per share these purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 with the new authorization in 2009 we have remaining authority to purchase up to 900000 additional shares of our common stock 

dividends — we declared a semiannual dividend of 40 per share on january 18 2010 we paid aggregate annual dividends per share of 72 79 and 44 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

line of credit — we have an 8000 line of credit under which 0 was outstanding at december 31 2009 the line bears interest at 09 over the libor rate we do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line 

effects of inflation— price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009 price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008 and 2007 

critical accounting policies— our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments

tax strategies – our effective tax rate is based on income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing these reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes asc 740 under this guidance if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information we regularly monitor our tax positions and asc 740 tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit when i there is a completion of a tax audit ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 

legal reserves – occasionally we are involved in legal matters the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time in some actions the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 4501005 contingencies  we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued if a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in most cases significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded although we believe we have adequately provided for probably losses from litigation the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially difference from reserves recorded

 item 1 business tableend fastenal company “fastenal” and together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2008 we had 2311 store locations located in the united states 50 states puerto rico canada 8 provinces mexico 14 states singapore china and the netherlands and employed 9428 people at these store locations in addition there were 4206 people employed in various support positions these support roles consisted of distribution and manufacturing 2709 people and administrative and sales support 1497 people 

we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2008 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

we operated 14 distribution centers in north america as of december 31 2008 from which we distribute products to our store and inplant locations 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

as of december 31 we operated store locations in 

 

 we have closed only 19 stores in our history and three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved their profitability 

we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction historically we have disclosed that we intend to continue opening new store locations and currently expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year however given the recent economic slowdown we are uncertain regarding this range for 2009 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to opening store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of store locations the majority of our stores operate under our ‘expected inventory’ format this format was formerly referred to as the csp or customer service project format in june 2005 we disclosed our intention to convert locations to the csp2 format the csp2 store model represented an expansion of the core stocking items and sales personnel in an existing store with the goal of driving additional product sales to existing customers target customers and specific geographic areas within established markets during the third quarter of 2007 we chose to modify the csp2 expansion from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to an ‘a la carte’ approach this emphasizes inventory expansion based on local customer demographics and the product knowledge of our local sales force consistent with our operating philosophy we intend to continue identifying products and store display themes to position our stores to the fastenal goal of being ‘the best industrial and construction supplier in each local market in which we operate’ 

  

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

in addition to the store types discussed above we also operate strategic account stores strategic account sites and “inplant” sites a strategic account store is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers we include these in our store count a strategic account site is essentially the same but it typically operates out of an existing store location rather than a unique location therefore it is not included in our store count an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer “inplant” sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 8 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 with approximately 74 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 53 stores opened in the first quarter of 2008 24 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of our stores from 2007 to 2008 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately 31917 or approximately 14 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2008 

 

  

    as of december 31 2008 we operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania modesto california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah greensboro north carolina kansas city kansas toronto ontario canada edmonton alberta canada and monterrey nuevo leon mexico these 14 distribution centers give us over 26 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier approximately 76 of our stores receive deliveries five timesaweek with 80 of these deliveries arriving by 700 am local time as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

  

our information systems department is responsible for developing implementing and maintaining computer based technology used to support business functions within fastenal corporate ebusiness and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central locations while each store uses a locally installed pointofsale pos system the systems consist of both customized and purchased software a dedicated wide area network wan is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks including fastenal® fasnit® fnl® blackstone® rock river™ blue global® fastenal racing® fnl g9® equiprite™ clean choice™ bodyguard™ profitter™ dynaflo™ fmt™ titan™ and powerphase™ we utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks including first in fasteners ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 and approximately 46 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

  

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

 we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continuously rebalanced utilizing an automated storetostore transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2008 approximately 951 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 49 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

  

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 910000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2008 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included later in this form 10k under the heading “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades during the fourth quarter of 2008 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 344000 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2008 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we use include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service and convenience 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see “employees” below 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we employed a total of 13634 full and parttime employees 9428 of whom were employed at a store location 2709 of whom were employed in one of our distribution centers manufacturing operations or service operations and the remaining 1497 of whom were employed at one of our administrative support facilities or home office 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within our organization for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all fastenal employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined cost containment goals 

none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which has harmed and could continue to harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our established stores open more than two years and their level of profitability 

this risk has come to bear during the last four months of 2008 as the economic condition in north america has weakened significantly our customers which are represented in various manufacturing nonresidential construction and services sectors have experienced a slowdown that has adversely impacted our sales and operating results 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth in part is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year although given the current economic slowdown we are uncertain of this range for 2009 failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

  

neither our current business strategy of expanding certain stores with additional product selection or our new business strategy of reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add outside sales personnel to existing stores has proven successful on a longterm basis 

in 2002 we began implementing a business strategy that focuses on store locations with a consistent wholesale merchandising theme which we formerly referred to as the customer service project or csp the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a longterm basis in june 2005 we disclosed our intention to convert locations to the csp2 format these stores have an additional investment which includes an additional 62 thousand in inventory two additional sales specialists and two additional vehicles in each store as discussed earlier in this report during the third quarter of 2007 we chose to modify the csp2 expansion from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to an ‘a la carte’ approach this emphasizes inventory expansion based on local customer demographics and the product knowledge of our sales force the results we achieved at our csp format stores may not be indicative of the results we will achieve at our a la carte format stores the a la carte format increases our operating costs per store but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in the a la carte stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores and therefore may negatively impact our gross margins in our a la carte format stores in addition we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during the appropriate time of year in our a la carte format stores we cannot assure our success in operating the a la carte format stores on a profitable basis if the a la carte format store is unprofitable the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 

in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy this strategy involves slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores are invested in additional outside sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax operating margin in a normal economic cycle we believe that over the five year period from 2007 to 2012 we can grow our average store sales to 125 thousand per month and grow our pretax operating margin from 18 to 23 however we cannot assure these results a downturn in the economy difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified outside sales personnel and failure to successfully change our selling process could impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve expected pretax earnings results 

lower volume orders and changes in our customers and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix and inbound inventory costs for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins furthermore there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to incrementally increase our gross margin percentage by varying product mix as we have over the last several years changes in our customers product mix or the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal’s name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

  

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and products lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have been rising during the last several years which has resulted in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution operation have risen as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers outside sales personnel and other store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

all other buildings we occupy are leased leased stores range from approximately 3500 to 10000 square feet with lease terms of up to 60 months most lease terms are for 36 to 48 months we also lease the following 

 

 if economic conditions are suitable we will in the future consider purchasing store locations to house our older stores it is anticipated the majority of new store locations will continue to be leased it is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store operations when desirable our experience has been that space suitable for our needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form 10k certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding 

business overview – fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies we operate stores primarily located in north america on december 31 2008 we operated 2311 companyowned or leased store locations 

most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades geographically our customers are primarily located in north america 

financial overview – during 2008 and 2007 the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business during most of 2006 and all of 2005 the strength of the global industrial environment positively impacted our performance the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years 2008 group reflects stores opened in 1998 and earlier and opened greater than five 

  

years 2008 group reflects stores opened in 2003 and earlier these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets the stores opened greater than two years 2008 group reflects stores opened in 2006 and earlier represent a consistent samestore view of our business the net sales growth rate for each of the groups was as follows 

 

 net sales – net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows 

 

 the 2008 2007 and 2006 net sales growth rate percentages reflect a weakening economy since late 2006 versus a strengthening economy from summer 2003 to late 2006 in the north american market the increase in net sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years growth in our newer product lines and new store openings 

stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately 31917 or 14 to 2008 net sales stores opened in 2007 contributed approximately 87374 or 37 to 2008 net sales and approximately 35267 or 17 to 2007 net sales the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years and as stated earlier the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 

monthly daily sales growth – our business had daily sales growth rates compared to the comparable month in the preceding year as follows 

 

 note daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period 

the strong growth in 2006 generally represents a continuation of the strong environments experienced in 2004 and 2005 the growth in 2007 generally represents a weakening environment which began in late 2006 the final three months of 2007 continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent 

  

improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 137 generally speaking this improvement in late 2007 remained in the first nine months of 2008 and weakened in the october to december time frame the third and fourth quarters of 2008 were influenced by variations in the number of business days versus 2007 this was most pronounced in september 2008 which had 21 business days versus 19 in september 2007 this had a dampening effect on september 2008’s daily average sales growth as some of our customer’s purchases are based more on monthly budgets rather than daily consumption the slowdown in the final three months of the year resulted from the general economic weakness in the global marketplace we believe the improvement in the final months of 2007 and the first nine months of 2008 and our performance in the final months of 2008 relative to the marketplace in which we operate were driven in part by our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative described later 

sales by product line— the following table indicates by product line the year of introduction and the percentage of net sales 

 

  

  impact of fuel prices – rising fuel prices negatively impacted 2008 and 2007 however we did feel some relief in the final months of 2008 during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2008 our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately 29 million 37 million 37 million and 24 million per month respectively during the first second third and fourth quarters of 2007 total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately 21 million 25 million 24 million and 27 million per month respectively the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs the freight initiative discussed below increases in product sales and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support additional sales personnel and to support additional store locations these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semitractors straight trucks and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately 5050 between distribution and store use 

in 2005 we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance the freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the fastenal trucking network which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units 

  

this initiative positively impacted the latter twothirds of 2005 all of 2006 all of 2007 and all of 2008 despite the changes in average per gallon fuel costs shown in the following table 

 

 the average price of a gallon of diesel fuel and a gallon of gasoline decreased by 43 and 147 respectively from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008 given the nature of our distribution business fluctuations in fuel prices can have a meaningful impact on our results this impact is also covered later in our discussion about gross margin and operating and administrative expenses 

gross profit margins – gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows 

 

 gross profit margins for 2008 increased over 2007 and 2006 the improvement was driven by several factors 1 a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin 2 a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost 3 improvements in our direct sourcing operations 4 continued focus on our freight initiative discussed earlier and 5 continued focus on our product availability this product availability focus centers on our ‘master stocking hubs’ in indianapolis indiana and modesto california and our efficient ability to move product from storetostore due to the benefit of item 4 above the rising fuel costs discussed earlier had only a nominal negative impact on our gross margin early in the first quarter of 2008 and this reversed to a positive gross margin impact from late in the first quarter into the second third and fourth quarters 

gross profit margins for 2007 increased over 2006 the improvement was driven by our freight initiative discussed earlier and by improvements in our direct sourcing operations these improvements were partially offset by the rising diesel fuel cost discussed earlier 

operating and administrative expenses – operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows 

 

 operating and administrative expenses in 2008 grew 170 over 2007 while this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of 135 it represents the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history the growth was primarily driven by 1 payroll and related costs which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement 2 transportation costs which expanded due to rising fuel costs and 3 our legal settlement described earlier in this form 10k as the economy dramatically weakened in october 2008 we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth were to continue to weaken we were pleased with our ability to reign in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 grew 110 over the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in 2007 this growth was primarily due to increases in occupancy and transportation expenses our stock option expense and to a lesser extent the initiatives most notably the csp2 conversions mentioned elsewhere in this form 10k 

the operating and administrative expenses for 2008 include 3247 of additional compensation expense related to the adoption of new stock option accounting rules in early 2007 during 2007 this expense was 1915 we granted options to purchase 2200000 shares in 2007 and an additional 275000 shares in april 2008 these options vest over a five to eight year period the two option grants when combined will result in compensation expense of approximately 300 per month for the next four years and dropping slightly in the remaining period no other stock options were outstanding during 2008 or 2007 

operating and administrative expenses grew at a rate faster than the net sales growth rate in 2006 this was primarily due to 1 the initiatives most notably the csp2 conversions mentioned elsewhere in this form 10k and their impact on employee numbers throughout the organization during 2006 2 the impact of rising fuel costs for the first eight months of the year and 3 increases in occupancy costs in addition the loss of a business day for the year which occurred in the third quarter negatively impacted our ability to leverage operating and administrative expenses 

payroll  related costs  payroll and related costs represented approximately 65 67 and 67 of operating and administrative expenses in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our net payroll cost for 2008 increased approximately 141 over 2007 our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased approximately 72 over the fourth quarter of 2007 the disparity between the 92 fulltime equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 72 expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of 2008 our sales personnel including our branch managers district managers and regional leaders are rewarded for growth in sales gross profit dollars and pretax earnings the contraction in the growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter when compared to the growth rates in previous quarters of 2008 drove the contraction in the growth of incentive commissions and bonuses 

in 2008 payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year in 2007 payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales in 2006 payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales growth primarily due to the impact of the additional employees from our csp2 conversions and from our master hub initiative effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively this tight management was significant given our store expansion discussed elsewhere and given our acceleration in the addition of outside sales personnel at existing stores discussed elsewhere 

the following sets forth the average number of employees numbers are presented on a fulltime equivalent basis for each of 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 the rate of increase in store personnel in 2008 was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed elsewhere the rate of increase in ‘distribution and manufacturing’ and ‘administrative and sales support’ personnel in 2008 and 2007 was slower than the sales growth rate due to the tight management of headcount growth since early 2007 when we first introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

we were pleased with our organization’s ability to manage payroll and related costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately 5207 4743 and 3153 respectively to our employees’ 401k plan accounts or registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of our canadian employees 

occupancy costs – occupancy costs represented approximately 173 184 and 173 of operating expenses in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in 2008 we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade occupancy expenses grew approximately 99 from 2007 to 2008 and 211 from 2006 to 2007 this improving trend was driven by the completion of our standard stocking model formerly referred to as csp store conversion during 2006 and due to the decrease in the rate of store openings pursuant to our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative occupancy costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 increased due to 1 a 75 81 and 140 increase in the number of store locations in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 2 the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative formerly referred to as csp and 3 the relocation of existing stores during 2008 2007 and 2006 we relocated approximately 5 8 and 12 of our stores respectively 

transportation costs – transportation costs represented approximately 54 50 and 50 of operating expenses in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively one component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful deleverage in 2008 was transportation cost our transportation costs grew approximately 267 from 2007 to 2008 and 144 from 2006 to 2007 this increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force 

gain loss on sale of property plant and equipment – the loss on sale of property and equipment for 2008 and 2006 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles the 2008 number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our dallas texas distribution center 

net earnings – net earnings net earnings per share eps growth rates in net earnings and growth rates in eps were as follows 

 

 during 2008 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses during 2007 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins during 2006 the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the impact of the improvements in gross profit margins the eps growth rate was greater than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in all three years 

  

working capital – two components of working capital accounts receivable and inventories are highlighted below the annual dollar increase and the annual rate of growth were as follows 

 

 these two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital these initiatives include 1 the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management this facility became operational early in 2005 and 2 the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory new expanded inventory inventory necessary for upcoming store openings or inventory necessary for our ‘master stocking hubs’ 

the accounts receivable increase of 36 from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 resulted from daily sales growth of 68 and 00 in november and december respectively the inventory increase from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 of 118 was less than our annual sales growth of 135 however it was higher than we expected a portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends therefore the drop in sales growth activity during the last two to three months of the year resulted in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product we reduced our ordering patterns on products with a longer lead time midway through the quarter to match current sales trends 

as we indicated in earlier communications our shortterm goals center on our ability to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ari to better than a 301 ratio on december 31 2008 and 2007 we had a ratio of 291 and 281 respectively 

pathway to profit – during april 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business for most of the last decade we have used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business opening approximately 140 new stores each year under our “pathway to profit” initiative we are adding outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns we intend to fund this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 70 to 100 per year we opened approximately 75 81 and 140 new stores in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our goal is fourfold 1 to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model 2 to grow the sales of our average store from 80 thousand per month spring 2007 to 125 thousand per month five years or 2012 3 to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow and 4 to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average store size increases 

  

in implementing the ‘pathway to profit’ we have increased our yearoveryear store count and fulltime equivalent fte head count at the end of each of the respective periods as follows 

 

 store size and profitability 1 – the store groups listed in the table below excluding our strategic account stores represented approximately 88 and 90 of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007 respectively strategic account stores which numbered 20 and 14 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007 respectively are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market our remaining sales approximately 12 related to either 1 our strategic account stores 2 our inplant locations 3 our direct fastenal cold heading business or 4 our direct import business our average store excluding the business not sold through a store had sales of 72500 per month in the fourth quarter of 2007 this average was 70200 per month in the fourth quarter of 2008 the average age number of stores and pretax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007 respectively were as follows 

three months ended december 31 2008 

 

 three months ended december 31 2007 

 

 as we indicated in april 2007 our goal during the five year period from 2007 to 2012 is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately 125000 per month by 2012 this will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories 0 to 30000 30001 to 60000 and 60001 to 100000 to the last three categories 60001 to 100000 100001 to 150000 and over 150000 and we believe this will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 

  

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities — net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2008 and 2007 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above 

the percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december 31 

 

 new stores open with the standard store model which consists of a core stocking level of approximately 62 thousand per location this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 

net cash used in investing activities — net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2008 increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures this was primarily due to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center the purchase of adjoining property in indianapolis indiana and the relocation of our dallas texas distribution center 

the 2007 decrease in investing activities is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures and the impact of approximately 12400 due to sales of marketable securities in 2007 the 2006 amount was also impacted by the purchase of a building and the equipment for our new distribution center in modesto california 

  

property and equipment expenditures in 2008 2007 and 2006 consist of 1 the purchase of software and hardware for fastenal’s information processing systems 2 the addition of certain pickup trucks 3 the purchase of signage shelving and other fixed assets related to store openings 4 the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment 5 the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties 6 the expansion of fastenal’s distributiontrucking fleet 7 the cost related to the relocation of our new dallas texas distribution center 2007 and 2008 8 the cost related to the expansion of our indianapolis indiana master distribution center 9 the cost of new manufacturing facility in rockford illinois and 10 the cost of our new master distribution center in modesto california 2006 disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pickup trucks semitractors and trailers in the normal course of business the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and in the case of 2008 the disposal of our former dallas texas distribution center 

we expect to incur approximately 65000 in total capital expenditures in 2009 consisting of approximately 34000 for manufacturing warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities 3000 for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and a la carte store expansions 12000 for data processing equipment 7000 for store buildings and improvement to store buildings and 9000 for vehicles we have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future as of december 31 2008 we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 

we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations from available cash and cash equivalents and to a lesser degree from our borrowing capacity in addition to opening new stores in the united states we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets 

we have future commitments for leased facilities and for leased vehicles at december 31 2008 the future contractual cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows 

 

 net cash used in financing activities – net cash used in financing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

 the 2008 and 2007 increase in cash used relative to 2006 is due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases these items in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows 

 

   

stock repurchase — on july 10 2008 we issued a press release announcing our board of directors had authorized purchases by us of up to an additional 1000000 shares of our common stock over and above previously authorized amounts during 2008 2007 and 2006 we purchased 590000 shares 2086000 shares and 474000 shares respectively of our outstanding stock the average price per share paid was approximately 4399 4186 and 3649 per share respectively with the new authorization in 2008 we have remaining authority to purchase up to approximately 1410000 additional shares of our common stock

effects of inflation— price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 

critical accounting policies— our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments

 item 1 business tableend fastenal company “fastenal” and together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2007 we had 2160 store locations located in 50 states puerto rico canada mexico singapore china and the netherlands and employed 8617 people at these stores 

we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2007 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

we operated 13 distribution centers in north america as of december 31 2007 from which we distribute products to our store locations 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively we operated store locations in 

 

 we have closed only eleven stores in our history three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved the profitability of the locations 

we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction we intend to continue opening new store locations and currently expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately 7 to 10 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to opening store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of store locations the majority of our stores operate under our ‘expected inventory’ format this format was also referred to as the csp or customer service project format consistent with our operating philosophy we intend to continue identifying products and store display themes to position our stores to the fastenal goal of being ‘the best industrial and construction supplier in each local market in which we operate’ in june 2005 we disclosed our intention to convert locations to the csp2 format the csp2 store model represented an expansion of the core stocking items and sales personnel in an existing store with the goal of driving additional product sales to existing customers target customers and specific geographic areas within established markets during the third quarter of 2007 we chose to modify the csp2 expansion from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to an ‘a la carte’ approach this will emphasize inventory expansion based on local customer demographics and based on local product knowledge within our sales force 

  

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

in addition to the store types discussed above we also operate “inplant” sites an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

we opened the following stores in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional stores outside of the united states in the future the stores located outside the united states contributed approximately 8 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 with approximately 78 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new store locations once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 73 stores opened in the first quarter of 2007 28 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of our stores from 2006 to 2007 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2007 contributed approximately 35432 or approximately 17 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2007 

 

  

  as of december 31 2007 we operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania modesto california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah greensboro north carolina kansas city kansas toronto ontario canada and monterrey nuevo leon mexico these 13 distribution centers give us over 22 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier approximately 76 of our stores receive deliveries five timesaweek with 80 of these deliveries arriving by 700 am as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

we provide centralized unix based computer systems to support corporate ebusiness and distribution center business functions the systems consist of both customized and purchased software at the store level we operate a proprietary pointofsale pos system that operates on a microsoft windows operating system system access is provided to authorized users via a dedicated wide area network wan the data exchange between the centrally located systems and pos is monitored and controlled centrally 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks including fastenal ® with various designs or tag lines fasnit ®  fnl ®  blackstone™ rock river anchors ®  blueglobal ®  fastenal racing ® and fnl g9 ®  although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

  

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 and approximately 46 46 and 48 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

 we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

  

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers inventory quantities are continually rebalanced utilizing an automated storetostore transfer mechanism called ‘inventory redistribution’ 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2007 approximately 948 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 52 of our consolidated net sales for 2007 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 825000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2007 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2007 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 314000 

  

during each of the three years ended december 31 2007 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we use include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service and convenience 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see “employees” below 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we employed a total of 12013 full and parttime employees 8617 being store managers and store employees and the balance being employed in our distribution centers manufacturing operations service operations and home office 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs see the description of the fastenal school of business below and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within our organization for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position or from an assistant manager’s position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all fastenal employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined cost containment goals 

  

none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our established stores open more than two years and their level of profitability 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers and historically the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7 to 10 each year failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

neither our current business strategy of expanding certain stores with additional product selection or our new business strategy of reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add outside sales personnel to existing stores has proven successful on a longterm basis 

in 2002 we began implementing our current business strategy that focuses on store locations with a consistent wholesale merchandising theme which we refer to as the customer service project or csp the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a longterm basis in june 2005 we disclosed our intention to convert locations to the csp2 format these stores have an additional investment which includes an additional 62000 in inventory two additional sales specialists and two additional vehicles in each store as discussed earlier in this report during the third quarter of 2007 we chose to modify the csp2 expansion from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to an ‘a la carte’ approach this will emphasize inventory expansion based on local customer demographics and based on local product knowledge within our sales force the results we achieved at our csp format stores may not be indicative of the results we will achieve at our a la carte format stores the a la carte format increases our operating costs per store but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in the a la carte stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores and therefore may negatively impact our gross margins in our a la carte format stores in addition we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during the appropriate time of year in our a la carte format stores we cannot assure our success in operating the a la carte format stores on a profitable basis if the a la carte format store is unprofitable the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 

in april 2007 we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy this strategy involves slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13 to 18 to approximately 7 to 10 the funds saved by opening fewer stores will be invested in additional outside sales personnel with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales capturing earnings leverage and increasing our pretax operating margin in a normal economic cycle we believe that over a five year period we can grow our average store sales to 125000 per month and grow our pretax operating margin from 18 to 23 however we cannot assure these results a downturn in the economy difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified outside sales personnel and failure to successfully change our selling process could impact our ability to grow average store sales capture earnings leverage and achieve expected pretax earnings results 

lower volume orders and changes in our customers and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix and inbound inventory costs for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins furthermore there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to incrementally increase our gross margin percentage by varying product mix as we have over the last several years changes in our customers product mix or the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline 

  

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal’s name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and products lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customer’s needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have been rising during the last several years which has resulted in increased production costs for our vendors these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution operation have risen as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers and store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

  

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive we believe that sales of industrial construction and maintenance industry supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years which may make the industry even more competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sale methods could cause us to lose market share or to reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 item 2 properties tableend we own seven facilities in winona minnesota these facilities are as follows 

 

 we also own the following facilities excluding store locations outside of winona minnesota 

 

 in addition we own 173 buildings that house our store locations in various cities throughout north america and are in the process of building or renovating another 7 owned store locations for future use 

 

   

all other buildings we occupy are leased leased stores range from approximately 3500 to 10000 square feet with lease terms of up to 60 months most lease term are for 36 to 48 months we also lease the following 

 

 if economic conditions are suitable we will in the future consider purchasing store locations to house our older stores it is anticipated the majority of new store locations will continue to be leased it is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store operations if deemed desirable our experience has been that space suitable for our needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient

 item 1 business tableend fastenal company “fastenal” and together with our wholly owned subsidiaries hereinafter referred to as fastenal or by terms such as we our or us began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2006 we had 2000 store sites located in 50 states puerto rico canada mexico singapore china and the netherlands and employed 7174 people at these sites 

we sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2006 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below our internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom  the information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

we operated twelve distribution centers in north america as of december 31 2006 from which we distribute products to our store sites 

development of the business 

fastenal began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees 

we opened our first store site in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store sites at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively we operated store sites in 

 

 we have closed only ten stores in our history three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved the profitability of the locations 

we select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction we intend to continue opening new store sites and currently expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately 13 to 18 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 

we stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines subsequent to opening store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base 

we currently have several versions of store locations the majority of our stores operate under our ‘expected inventory’ format this format was also referred to as the csp or customer service project format since 2005 we have also had a csp2 format this format is an expansion of the stocking pattern of the first type we had 199 of this type of store at december 31 2006 during 2006 we created two new formats called the ‘strategic account store’ and csp3 the ‘strategic account store’ format focuses on the needs of strategic customers in the local markets and stocks product to serve this need we had five of this type of store at december 31 2006 the csp3 store format is a prototype store to test the potential expansion of our current standard product offerings we had one of this type of store at december 31 2006 and plan to open seven to nine more in 2007 

  

we believe based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store sites may be in cities in which we currently operate fastenal has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

in addition to the store types discussed above we also operate “inplant” sites an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

we opened the following store sites in the last five years 

 

 we plan to open additional store sites outside of the united states in the future the store sites located outside the united states contributed approximately 7 of our consolidated net sales in 2006 with approximately 78 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable 

it has been our experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites this adverse effect is due to the startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 73 stores opened in the first quarter of 2006 32 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006 

  

for 2006 annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately 250 and 12233 with 75 of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 498 to 1895 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of our stores from 2005 to 2006 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2006 contributed approximately 32920 or approximately 18 of our consolidated net sales in 2006 with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2006 

 

  

  

 as of december 31 2006 we operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania modesto california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah greensboro north carolina kansas city kansas and toronto ontario these twelve distribution centers give us over 22 million square feet of distribution capacity these distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier approximately 85 of our stores receive deliveries five timesaweek as the number of stores increases we intend to add new distribution centers 

we operate a central unixterminalbased computer system allowing automatic data exchange between our stores and our distribution centers this system consists of both customized and purchased software the use of clientserver technology allows our network of unixbased machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations and is provided to authorized users via a dedicated wide area network wan at the store level we operate a proprietary pointofsale pos system that operates on a microsoft windows operating system the data exchange between the centrally located systems and pos is monitored and controlled centrally 

trademarks and service marks 

we conduct business under various trademarks and service marks including fastenal ® with various designs or tag lines fasnit ®  fnl ®  blackstone™ and fnl g9™ although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks we consider the ‘fastenal’ name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business 

  

products 

our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line which we refer to as the fastener product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 and approximately 46 48 and 50 of our consolidated net sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

since 1993 we have added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastener product line our product lines include the following 

 

  

 we plan to continue to add other product lines in the future 

  

inventory control 

our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems our sales personnel at the store district and region levels and our product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores from individual stores and from geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2006 approximately 948 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 52 of our consolidated net sales for 2006 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing we engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of our consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

we use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 689000 standard stock items we distribute most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of our purchases in 2006 

geographic information 

information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

we believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of our products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2006 our total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 275000 

  

during each of the three years ended december 31 2006 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales we believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to us from economic downturns in a particular market 

store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of our business we make limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers the forms of advertising we use include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

competition 

our business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service and convenience 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales we however believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete see “employees” below 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed a total of 10415 full and parttime employees 7174 being store managers and store employees and the balance being employed in our distribution centers manufacturing operations service operations and home office 

we believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets we foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs see the description of the fastenal school of business below and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within our organization for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position or from an assistant manager’s position and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all fastenal employees our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance in addition we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

our sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume we also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth before and after taxes profitability and return on assets and to our other personnel for achieving predetermined cost containment goals none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our established stores more than two years old and their level of profitability 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers and the most effective way to attract new customers is by opening new stores our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 13 to 18 each year which is consistent with our historical average failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

neither our current business strategy that focuses on stores with an industrialleaning retail look and feel nor our new business strategy of opening certain stores with additional product selection has been proven successful on a longterm basis 

in 2002 we began implementing our current business strategy that focuses on store locations with an industrialleaning retail look and feel which we refer to as the customer service project or csp the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a longterm basis we recently transitioned from opening csp stores to expanding certain stores with additional product selection which requires an additional 62 thousand in inventory two additional sales specialists and two additional vehicles in each store we refer to this new larger store format as csp2 the results we achieved at our csp format stores may not be indicative of the results we will achieve at our csp2 format stores the new format increases our operating costs per store but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in the csp2 stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores and therefore may negatively impact our gross margins in our larger format stores in addition we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during the appropriate time of year in our larger format stores we cannot assure our success in operating the csp2 format stores on a profitable basis if a csp2 format store is unprofitable the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 

lower volume orders and changes in our customers and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix and inbound inventory costs for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins furthermore there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to incrementally increase our gross margin percentage by varying product mix as we have over the last several years changes in our customers product mix or the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal’s name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

  

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses relating to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

the ability to identify new products and products lines and integrate them into our store and distribution network may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customer’s needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products in addition our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products eg steel and energy costs have been rising during the last several years which has resulted in increased production costs for our vendors those vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution operation have risen as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part on our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers and store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive we believe that sales of industrial construction and maintenance industry supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years which may make the industry even more competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sale methods could cause us to lose market share or to reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 item 1 business tableend fastenal company “fastenal company” and together with its wholly owned subsidiaries fastenal company services this entity merged with fastenal company purchasing during 2005 fastenal company purchasing fastenal company leasing fastenal canada company fastenal mexico s de rl de cv fastenal mexico services s de rl de cv fastenal singapore pte ltd fastenal asia pacific limited fastco shanghai trading co ltd fastenal ip company and fastenal europe bv collectively “the company” began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2005 the company had 1755 store sites located in 50 states puerto rico canada mexico singapore china and the netherlands and employed 6392 people at these sites 

the company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2005 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below the company’s internet address for corporate and investor information is wwwfastenalcom the information contained on this web site or connected to the company’s web site is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k and should not be considered part of this report 

the company operated twelve distribution centers in north america as of december 31 2005 from which the company distributes products to its store sites 

development of the business 

fastenal company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company’s employees 

the company opened its first store site in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows the consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years and the number of company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years 

 

   

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the company operated store sites in 

 

 the company has closed only ten stores in its history three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of the company’s product line or the expansion of the company’s distribution network improved the profitability of the locations 

the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the company’s distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction the company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately 13 to 18 per year calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year 

the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines subsequent to opening the store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of its customer base 

  

the company believes based on the demographics of the marketplace in north america that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3500 total stores many of the new store sites would be in cities in which the company currently operates the company has not operated outside of north america long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

in addition to the stores discussed above the company also operates “inplant” sites an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

the company opened the following store sites in the last five years 

 

 the company plans to open additional store sites outside of the united states in the future the store sites located outside the united states contributed approximately 6 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2005 with approximately 83 of this amount attributable to our canadian operations 

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable 

it has been the company’s experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites due to the related startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 74 stores opened in the first quarter of 2005 26 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

for 2005 annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately 119 and 9070 with 75 of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 447 to 1830 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the company’s stores from 2004 to 2005 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2005 contributed approximately 35500 or approximately 23 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2005 with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2005 

 

  

 as of december 31 2005 the company operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania fresno california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah greensboro north carolina kansas city kansas and toronto ontario distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to company stores using company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier approximately 85 of the company’s stores receive five timeaweek delivery as the number of stores increases the company intends to add new distribution centers 

the company operates a central unixterminalbased computer system allowing automatic data exchange between the stores and the distribution centers the use of clientserver technology allows the company’s network of unixbased machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations during the last several years the company has been converting a portion of this central processing system to a new computer software and operating system and plans to convert additional modules during 2006 at the store level the company operates a proprietary pointofsale system this system operates on a microsoft windows operating system 

trademarks and service marks 

the company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including fastenal ® with various designs or tag lines fasnit ®  fnl ®  blackstone™ and fnl g9™ although the company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks the company considers its ‘fastenal’ name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its business 

  

products 

the company’s original product offering was fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the fastenal ® product name this product line consists of two broad categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope strut privatelabel stud anchors rivets and related accessories 

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore the company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops 

threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90 of the fastener product line sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastenal ® product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

since 1993 the company added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastenal ® product line the company’s product lines include the following 

 

  

 the company plans to add other product lines in the future 

  

inventory control 

the company determines its inventory stocking levels through its computer systems its sales personnel at the store district and region levels and its product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of the company’s stores from individual stores and from geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers 

manufacturing and support services operations 

in 2005 approximately 951 of the company’s consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 49 of the company’s consolidated net sales for 2005 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by either the company’s manufacturing division or its support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing the company engages in these activities primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales 

sources of supply 

the company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 580000 standard stock items it distributes most items distributed by the company can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of the company’s purchases in 2005 

geographic information 

information regarding the company’s revenues and certain of the company’s assets by geographic location is set forth in note 10 to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in fastenal company’s annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 which is incorporated herein by reference foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact the company’s ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and the company’s foreign sales 

customers and marketing 

the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer customers in small medium and largesized cities a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company’s employees most of the company’s customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of the company’s products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2005 the company’s total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 232000 

  

during each of the past three years ended december 31 2005 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of the company’s sales the company believes that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to the company from economic downturns in a particular market 

store personnel generate a significant portion of the company’s sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of the company’s business the company makes limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers forms of advertising used by the company include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

competition 

the company’s business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which the company has stores the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the company’s products are customer service and convenience 

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales the company however believes that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with the company’s ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances the company’s ability to compete see “employees” below 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 the company employed a total of 9306 full and parttime employees 6392 being store managers and store employees and the balance being employed in the company’s distribution centers manufacturing operations service operations and home office 

the company believes the quality of its employees is critical to its ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its ability to open new stores in new markets the company fosters the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs see fastenal school of business below and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within the company for example most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position or from an assistant manager’s position at another store and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

the fastenal school of business fsb is a comprehensive corporate university which fosters fastenal employees’ continual development and business success through education fsb provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to successful fastenal employees performance as well as provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning these institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business these institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership effective store best practices sales and marketing product education and distribution 

the company’s sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of the company’s total employment cost varies with sales volume the company also pays incentive bonuses to its leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth profitability and return on assets and to its other personnel for achieving predetermined cost containment goals 

  

none of the company’s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company has experienced no work stoppages the company believes its employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties the material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows 

a downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending which could harm our operating results 

in general our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers this spending is affected by many factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our established stores more than two years old and their level of profitability 

our current estimate for total store market potential in north america could be incorrect 

one of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the introduction of stores into new markets based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the us canada and mexico we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in north america to support approximately 3500 stores we cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity in addition a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store 

  

we may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings 

our growth is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers and the most effective way to attract new customers is by opening new stores our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 13 to 18 each year which is consistent with our historical average failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our longterm growth 

neither our current business strategy that focuses on stores with an industrialleaning retail look and feel nor our new business strategy of opening certain stores with additional product selection has been proven successful on a longterm basis 

in 2002 we began implementing our current business strategy that focuses on store locations with an industrialleaning retail look and feel which we refer to as the customer service project or csp the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a longterm basis we recently transitioned from opening csp stores to expanding certain stores with additional product selection which requires an additional 62 thousand in inventory two additional sales specialists and two additional vehicles in each store we refer to this new larger store format as csp2 the results we achieved at our csp format stores may not be indicative of the results we achieve at our csp2 format stores the new format increases our operating costs per store but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in the csp2 stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores and therefore may negatively impact our gross margins in our larger format stores in addition we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during our busiest seasons in our larger format stores we cannot assure our success in operating the csp2 format stores on a profitable basis if a csp2 format store is unprofitable the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 

lower volume orders and changes in our customers and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future 

from time to time we have experienced changes in product mix and inbound inventory costs for example marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past when we change our product mix there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins furthermore there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to incrementally increase our gross margin percentage by varying product mix as we have over the last several years changes in our customers product mix or the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline 

opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations 

we intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy new stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts in new markets we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with fastenal’s name and capabilities in addition entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new unfamiliar competitors we cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 

  

new store openings may negatively impact our operating results 

while new stores build the infrastructure for future growth the first year sales in new stores are low and the added expenses related to payroll occupancy and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings it has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis 

our ability to develop product expertise at the store level identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins 

one of our growth strategies is to continue to lead our industry in product selection and expertise at the store level by enhancing existing product selection and by developing and marketing new product selections that respond to customer needs we may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products 

increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses which may result in lower operating margins 

costs of raw materials used in our products ie steel and energy costs have been rising during the last several years which has resulted in increased production costs for our vendors those vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases the fuel costs of our distribution operation are rising as well while we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact we may not be successful failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins 

our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs sales at existing stores and the rate of new store openings 

our success depends in part upon our ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store managers and store associates who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas and the turnover rate in the industry is high if we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge our sales could be materially adversely affected additionally competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores any such delays any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network could impact our distribution system 

our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the west coast in 2002 may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations in addition severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales 

because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies in addition fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar 

we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors which could harm our business and operating results 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry although consolidating still remains a large fragmented industry that is highly competitive we believe that sales of industrial construction and maintenance industry supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years which may make the industry even more competitive our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence name recognition and financial marketing and other resources and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection financial resources and services increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sale methods could cause us to lose market share or to reduce our prices or increase our spending thus eroding our margins 

our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by the economic conditions political situations and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries over which we have no control 

we obtain certain of our products and our suppliers obtain certain of their products from china taiwan south korea mexico and other foreign countries our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control including foreign government regulations political unrest war disruption or delays in shipments changes in local economic conditions and trade issues our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business 

the industrial construction and maintenance supply industry in north america is currently consolidating this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 

there can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation the trend in our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins furthermore as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects

 if economic conditions are suitable the company will in the future consider purchasing store sites to house its older stores it is anticipated that all sites for new stores will continue to be leased it is the company’s policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store operations if deemed desirable by management it has been the company’s experience that space suitable for its needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient

the company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2004 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below 

  

the company operated twelve distribution centers as of december 31 2004 from which the company distributes products to its store sites 

  

development of the business 

  

fastenal company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company’s employees 

  

the company opened its first store site in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows the number of company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years and the related consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years 

  

   

as of december 31 2004 the company operated store sites in 

  

   

the company has closed only ten stores in its history three of these locations were subsequently reopened when the expansion of the company’s product line or the expansion of the company’s distribution network improved the profitability of the locations 

  

the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the company’s distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction the company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately 13 to 18 per year 

  

the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines subsequent to opening the store personnel may supplement the inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of its customer base 

  

the company believes based on the demographics of the marketplace in the united states and canada that there is sufficient potential in those two countries to support at least 2500 total stores many of the new store sites would be in cities in which the company currently operates the company has not operated outside of the united states and canada long enough to assess the market potential of those markets 

  

in addition to the stores discussed above the company also operates “inplant” sites an “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

  

the company opened the following store sites outside the united states in the last five years 

  

   

during 2002 the company began operating an “inplant” site in the dominican republic the company plans to open additional store sites in puerto rico canada mexico singapore and the netherlands in the future the store sites located outside the united states contributed approximately 6 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2004 

  

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable 

  

it has been the company’s experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites due to the related startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 49 stores opened in the first quarter of 2004 21 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

for 2004 annual sales volumes of stores operating at least five years ranged between approximately 137 and 7290 with 75 of these stores having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 449 to 1760 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the company’s stores from 2003 to 2004 based on the age of each store the stores opened in 2004 contributed approximately 31500 or approximately 25 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2004 with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2004 

  

     

as of december 31 2004 the company operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania fresno california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah winstonsalem north carolina kansas city kansas and toronto ontario distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to company stores using company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases the company intends to add new distribution centers 

  

on august 31 2001 the company acquired certain assets of two subsidiaries of textron inc these assets were used in their business of selling packaged fasteners to the retail market doityourself or diy business the diy business was purchased after a prolonged period of contraction therefore the historical sales and earnings were not reflective of the diy business’s operations at the time it was acquired by the company the diy business was subsequently sold to the hillman group inc on october 3 2002 the diy business produced net sales of 16974 and 8526 during the approximately nine months and four months respectively that it was operated by the company in 2002 and 2001 or approximately 19 and 10 of total net sales in each year respectively

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore the company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 46 45 and 46 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastenal® product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly 

  

since 1993 the company added additional product lines these product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original fastenal® product line the additional product lines include the following 

  

     

the company plans to add other product lines in the future 

  

inventory control 

  

the company determines its inventory stocking levels through its computer systems its sales personnel at the store district and region levels and its product managers the data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of company’s stores from individual stores and from geographic areas it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information the computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment or prompts a buyer to purchase as necessary based on an established minimummaximum level all stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers 

  

manufacturing and support services operations 

  

in 2004 approximately 948 of the company’s consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards the remaining 52 of the company’s consolidated net sales for 2004 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by either the company’s manufacturing division or its support services the manufactured products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications the services provided by the support services group include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade welding thirdparty logistics and light manufacturing the company engages in these activities primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales 

  

sources of supply 

  

the company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 515000 standard stock items it distributes most items distributed by the company can be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more than 5 of the company’s purchases in 2004 

  

geographic information 

  

information regarding the company’s revenues and certain of the company’s assets by geographic location is set forth in note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in fastenal company’s annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 which is incorporated herein by reference foreign currency fluctuations changes in trade relations or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact the company’s ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and the company’s foreign sales 

  

customers and marketing 

  

the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer customers in small medium and largesized cities a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company’s employees most of the company’s customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of the company’s products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies federal state and local governmental entities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2004 the company’s total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 204000 

  

during each of the past three years ended december 31 2004 no one customer accounted for a significant portion of the company’s sales the company believes that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to the company from economic downturns in a particular market 

  

store personnel generate a significant portion of the company’s sales through direct calls on customers because of the nature of the company’s business the company makes limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television radio and newspapers forms of advertising used by the company include signs catalogs and direct mailings 

  

competition 

  

the company’s business is highly competitive competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which the company has stores the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the company’s products are customer service and convenience 

  

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales the company however believes that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with the company’s ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances the company’s ability to compete see “employees” below 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 the company employed a total of 7946 full and parttime employees 5502 being store managers and store employees and the balance being employed in the company’s distribution centers manufacturing operations service operations and home office 

  

the company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its ability to open new stores in new markets the company fosters the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions are from within the company for example most new store managers are promoted from an assistant manager’s position at another store and district managers who supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers 

  

the company’s sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a significant portion of the company’s total employment cost varies with sales volume the company also pays incentive bonuses to its leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors sales growth profit growth profitability and return on assets and to its other personnel for achieving predetermined cost containment goals 

  

none of the company’s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company has experienced no work stoppages the company believes its employee relations are excellent

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales the company however believes that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small medium and large markets each offering a wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area taken together with the company’s ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products having trained personnel at each store also enhances the company’s ability to compete see “employees” below

 item 1 business 

  

fastenal company “fastenal company” and together with its wholly owned subsidiaries fastenal company services fastenal company purchasing fastenal company leasing fastenal canada company fastenal mexico s de rl de cv fastenal mexico services s de rl de cv and fastenal singapore pte ltd collectively “the company” began as a partnership in 1967 and was incorporated under the laws of minnesota in 1968 as of december 31 2002 the company had 1169 store sites located in 50 states puerto rico canada mexico and singapore and 4743 people employed at these sites 

  

the company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion as of december 31 2002 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines described further below 

  

  

the company operated eleven distribution centers as of december 31 2002 from which the company distributes products to its store sites and operates a facility in memphis tennessee to receive and distribute products coming from suppliers involved in the company’s ‘customer service project’ csp 

  

development of the business 

  

fastenal company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small mediumsized and in subsequent years large cities the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the company’s employees 

  

the company opened its first store site in winona minnesota a city with a population of approximately 25000 the following table shows the number of company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years and the related consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years 

  

   

as of december 31 2002 the company operated 1169 store sites located in 

  

   

the company has closed only four stores in its history 

  

the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the company’s distribution network population statistics and employment data for manufacturing and construction the company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately 14 to 16 per year 

  

the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines subsequent to a site’s opening the site personnel may customize the inventory offering to that site’s customer base 

  

for several years the company had two types of stores 1 the standalone store and 2 the satellite store the standalone store was typically located in cities with a population in excess of 8000 the second type the satellite store operated as a satellite of a standalone store the satellite store was usually located within 30 miles of the standalone mother store and was typically managed by personnel at the mother store the company had satellite stores located in communities with a population as small as 2000 the company discontinued this distinction at the end of 2002 of the 144 stores opened during 2002 none opened as a satellite store the company believes based on the demographics of the marketplace in the united states and canada that there is sufficient potential in those two countries to support approximately 2000 to 2200 total stores many of the new store sites would be in cities in which we currently operate 

  

in addition to the stores discussed above the company also operates “inplant” sites the “inplant” site is a selling unit located in or near a customer’s facility these sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store 

  

  

the company opened the following store sites outside the united states in the last five years 

  

   

during 2002 the company began operating an “inplant” site in the dominican republic the company plans to open additional store sites in puerto rico canada mexico and singapore in the future the store sites located outside the united states contributed less than 5 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2002 in all years presented the company also sold products into mexico from its existing stores along the border between the united states and mexico 

  

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable 

  

it has been the company’s experience that nearterm profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites due to the related startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month of the 24 stores opened in the first quarter of 2002 10 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

for 2002 annual sales volumes of store sites operating at least five years ranged between approximately 175 and 7061 with 75 of these store sites having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 417 to 1640 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the company’s store sites from 2001 to 2002 based on each site’s age dollar amounts in thousands the store sites opened in 2002 contributed approximately 186 or approximately 21 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2002 with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2002 and from the acquisition of the diy business discussed below 

  

   

   

  

as of december 31 2002 the company operated distribution centers in or near winona minnesota indianapolis indiana dallas texas atlanta georgia scranton pennsylvania fresno california seattle washington akron ohio salt lake city utah winstonsalem north carolina and kansas city missouri distribution centers are located so as to permit twiceaweek to five timesaweek deliveries to company stores using company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier as the number of stores increases the company intends to add new distribution centers the company also operates a centralized distribution center in memphis tennessee this facility consolidates inventory for the ‘customer service project’ csp and ships it to existing stores for use in conversion to the csp format and also to new stores 

  

on august 31 2001 the company acquired certain assets of two subsidiaries of textron inc these assets were used in their business of selling packaged fasteners to the retail market doityourself or diy business the diy business was purchased after a prolonged period of contraction therefore the historical sales and earnings were not reflective of the diy business’s operations at the time it was acquired by the company the diy business was subsequently sold to the hillman group inc on october 3 2002 the diy business produced net sales of 16974 and 8526 during the approximately nine months and four months respectively that it was operated by the company in 2002 and 2001 the diy business had facilities in rockford illinois and goodlettsville tennessee near nashville 

  

the company operates a central unixterminalbased computer system allowing automatic data exchange between the stores and the distribution centers the use of clientserver technology allows the company’s network of unixbased machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations during the last four years the company has been converting a portion of this central processing system to a new computer software and operating system and plans to convert additional modules during 2003 at the store level the company operates a proprietary pointofsale system this system operates on a microsoft windows nt system

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market therefore the company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 46 49 and 51 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the other supply items included in the fastenal ® product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly

development of the business

fastenal company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded
fasteners to customers in small to mediumsized cities the company believes its
success can be attributed to its ability to offer such customers a full line of
products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the companys
employees

the company opened its first store site in winona minnesota a city with a
population of approximately 25000 the following table shows the number of
company store sites during each of the last ten years and the related
consolidated net sales for each year during that period

     1 during 2000 two inplant sites previously included in the store
         site number were reclassified to inplant status one of these
         inplant sites opened in 1996 and the other opened in 1997 the 1999
         1998 1997 and 1996 store numbers above were adjusted to reflect the
         reclassification

     2 the net sales amounts for 2000 and prior years have been restated to
         reflect the reclassification of shipping and handling costs billed to
         customers and sales incentives paid to customers which were previously
         included in operating and administrative expenses this
         reclassification reflects the adoption of emerging issues task force

the company has closed only four store sites in its history

page

                                        4

the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the
companys distribution network population statistics and employment data for
manufacturing and construction the company intends to continue opening new
store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be
approximately 10 to 15 per year

the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its
product lines subsequent to a sites opening the site personnel customize the
inventory offering to that sites customer base the company has two types of
stores 1 the standalone store and 2 the satellite store the standalone
store is typically located in cities with a population in excess of 8000 the
second type the satellite store operates as a satellite of a standalone
store the satellite store is usually located within 30 miles of the standalone
mother store and is typically managed by personnel at the mother store the
company has satellite stores located in communities with a population as small
as 2000 in most cases the company was already doing business in this
community from the mother store but the addition of a physical presence in the
community provided sales increases from that community the company believes
based on the demographics of the marketplace in the united states and canada
that there is sufficient potential in those two countries to support
approximately 2000 to 2200 total stores many of these stores would be in
cities in which we currently operate the company believes most of the future
stores will be standalone stores and that some of the satellite stores will
eventually become standalone stores of the 128 stores opened during 2001 none
opened as a satellite store of the 1025 store sites operating at december 31
2001 954 stores were operating as standalone stores and 71 were operating as
satellite stores

in addition to the standalone and satellite stores discussed above the company
also operates inplant sites the inplant site is a selling unit located in
or near a customers facility these sites are not included in the store count
numbers as they represent a customer subset of the two types of stores mentioned
earlier

the company opened the following store sites outside the united states in the
last five years



                                    2001        2000       1999       1998        1997

the company plans to open additional store sites in puerto rico canada mexico
and singapore in the future the store sites located outside the united states
contributed less than 5 of the companys consolidated net sales in 2001 in all
years presented the company also sold products into mexico from its existing
stores along the border between the united states and mexico

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will
be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable

it has been the companys experience that nearterm profitability has been
adversely affected by the opening of new store sites due to the related
startup costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store
generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated
contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it
typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first
profitable month of the 50 stores opened in the first quarter of 2001 18 were
profitable in the fourth quarter of 2001

for 2001 annual sales volumes of store sites operating at least five years
ranged between approximately 165000 and 5939000 with 75 of these store
sites having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 477000 to
1745000 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average
sales of the companys store sites from 2000 to 2001 based on each sites age
the store sites opened in 2001 contributed approximately 216 million or
approximately 26 of the companys consolidated net sales in 2001 with the
remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2001 and from the 2001
acquisition

trademarks

the company conducts its business in the united states canada puerto rico
mexico and singapore under various trademarks and service marks including
fastenalr fasttoolr sharpcutr equipriter cleanchoicer
powerphasetm fastarctm fasnittm and anchor wiretm although the
company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent upon any of
its trademarks or service marks the company considers its fastenal name and
other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its business

products

the companys original product offering in 1967 was fasteners and other
industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the
fastenalr product name today this product line consists of approximately
78000 different stock items this product line may be divided into two broad
categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related
washers and miscellaneous supplies such as paints various pins and machinery
keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing systems wire rope
stainless strut private label stud anchors rivets and related accessories

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects
and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures although some
aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities the company
feels that each citys market is to some extent unique therefore the company
opens each store with minimal base stocks of inventory and then tailors the
growing inventory to the local market demand as it develops threaded fasteners
accounted for approximately 49 51 and 51 of the companys consolidated net
sales in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the other supply items included
in the fastenalr product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as
part of the completed anchor assembly

during the last ten years the company added additional product lines the
product lines introduced during the 1990s are sold through the same
distribution channel as the original fastenalr product line the retail
packaged product line introduced in 2001 as the result of an acquisition is sold
through both a retail distribution channel and through the companys industrial
store site distribution channel the additional product lines include the
following

inventory control

the company controls inventory by using computer systems to determine desired
stock levels the data used for this purpose is derived from reports showing
sales activity by stock item for the previous three years computers then
convert this data to typical store maximumminimum inventory levels for each
stock item stores can deviate from preset inventory levels as deemed
appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are
established from computerized sales data for the stores served by the respective
centers

manufacturing and support services operations

in 2001 approximately 957 of the companys consolidated net sales were
attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards
the remaining amount of approximately 43 of the companys consolidated net
sales for 2001 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by either
the companys manufacturing division or its support services the manufactured
products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to
customers specifications the services provided by the support services group
include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade
welding and light manufacturing the company engages in these activities
primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the
future to continue to contribute in the range of 4 to 10 of the companys
consolidated net sales

sources of supply

the company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 280000
standard stock items it distributes most items distributed by the company can
be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some
stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more
than 50 of the companys purchases in 2001

customers and marketing

the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer
customers in small medium and largesized cities a full line of products at
convenient locations and to the high quality of the companys employees most
of the companys customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets
the construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and
road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment
manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of the
companys products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies
municipalities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2001 the
companys total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having
purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 147000

during each of the three years ended december 31 2001 no one customer
accounted for a significant portion of the companys sales the company believes
that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that
they represent provide some protection to the company from economic downturns in
a particular market

store personnel generate a significant portion of the companys sales through
direct calls on customers because of the nature of the companys business the
company does not use the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as
television radio and newspapers forms of advertising used by the company
include signs catalogs and direct mailings

competition

the companys business is highly competitive competitors include both large
distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located
in many of the same cities in which the company has stores the company believes
that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the companys
products are customer service and convenience

some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main
warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales the company
however believes that the convenience provided to customers by actually
operating a number of stores in both small and large markets each offering a
wide variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large
number of stores in a given area taken together with the companys ability to
provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution
centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products
having trained personnel at each store also enhances the companys ability to
compete see employees below

employees

as of december 31 2001 the company employed a total of 6536 full and
parttime employees 4263 being store managers and store employees and the
balance being employed in the companys distribution centers packaging
facilities manufacturing operations service operations packagingprocessing
centers and home office

                                        9

the company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its
ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its
ability to open new stores in new markets the company fosters the growth and
education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training
programs and by decentralizing decisionmaking wherever possible promotions
are from within the company for example most new store managers are promoted
from an assistant managers position at another store and district managers who
supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers

the companys sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that
place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while
still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections as a result a
significant portion of the companys total employment cost varies with sales
volume the company also pays incentive bonuses to other personnel for achieving
predetermined cost containment goals

none of the companys employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement
and the company has experienced no work stoppages the company believes its
employee relations are excellent

than sufficient

development of the business

fastenal company began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded
fasteners to customers in small to mediumsized cities the company believes its
success can be attributed to its ability to offer such customers a full line of
products at convenient locations and to the high quality of the companys
employees

the company opened its first store site in winona minnesota a city with a
population of approximately 25000 the following table shows the number of
company store sites during each of the last ten years and the related
consolidated net sales for each year during that period

the company has closed only four store sites in its history

                                       4

the company selects new locations for its stores based on their proximity to the
companys distribution network population statistics and employment data for
manufacturing and construction the company intends to continue opening new
store sites and currently expects the rate of new store openings to be
approximately 10 to 15 per year

the company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its
product lines subsequent to a sites opening the site personnel customize the
inventory offering to that sites customer base the company has two types of
stores 1 the standalone store and 2 the satellite store the standalone
store is typically located in cities with a population in excess of 8000 the
company believes approximately 1000 markets in the united states and canada
including those in which existing standalone stores are already located has
sufficient potential to justify this type of store many of the future potential
markets for standalone stores are located in smaller communities the second
type the satellite store operates as a satellite of a standalone store the
satellite store is usually located within 30 miles of the standalone mother
store and is typically managed by personnel at the mother store the company has
satellite stores located in communities with a population as small as 2000 in
most cases the company was already doing business in this community from the
mother store but the addition of a physical presence in the community provided
sales increases from that community of the 90 stores opened during 2000 three
opened as satellite stores although the company cannot be sure of the success
of these stores the company believes that their success could lead to
approximately 500 satellite store sites in the united states and canada some of
these satellite stores are expected to eventually become standalone stores of
the 897 store sites operating at december 31 2000 828 stores were operating as
standalone stores and 69 were operating as satellite stores

in addition to the standalone and satellite stores discussed above the company
also operates inplant sites the inplant site is a selling unit located in
or near a customers facility these sites are not included in the store count
numbers

the company opened nine store sites in canada in 1998 five in 1999 and eleven
in 2000 and plans to open additional store sites in canada in the future the
company opened three store sites in puerto rico in 1998 none in 1999 and one
in 2000 and plans to open additional store sites in puerto rico in the future
the stores in canada and puerto rico contributed less than 5 of the companys
consolidated net sales in 2000 in 2000 the company sold products into mexico
from its existing stores along the border between the united states and mexico
the company also established a mexican subsidiary in 1998 this subsidiary
employs sales personnel who sell directly into mexico during 2001 the company
intends to open a store site in mexico

no assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will
be achieved or that new stores once opened will be profitable

it has been the companys experience that nearterm profitability has been
adversely affected by the opening of new store sites due to the related start
up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base a new store
generates its sales from direct sales calls a slow process involving repeated
contacts as a result of this process sales volume builds slowly and it
typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first
profitable month of the twelve stores opened in the first quarter of 2000
seven were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2000

for 2000 annual sales volumes of store sites operating at least five years
ranged between approximately 200000 and 5400000 with 75 of these store
sites having annual sales volumes within the range of approximately 500000 to
1900000 the data in the following table shows the growth in the average
sales of the companys store sites from 1999 to 2000 based on each sites age
the store sites opened in 2000 contributed approximately 85 million or
approximately 11 of the companys consolidated net sales in 2000 with the
remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2000

trademarks

the company conducts its business in the united states canada and puerto rico
under various trademarks and service marks including fastenalr fasttoolr
sharpcutr equipriter cleanchoicer powerphasetm and fastarctm
although the company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent
upon any of its trademarks or service marks the company considers its
fastenal name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its
business

products

the companys original product offering in 1967 was fasteners and other
industrial and construction supplies many of which are sold under the
fastenalr product name today this product line consists of approximately
68000 different stock items this product line may be divided into two broad
categories threaded fasteners such as bolts nuts screws studs and related
washers and other industrial and construction supplies such as paints various
pins and machinery keys concrete anchors batteries sealants metal framing
systems wire rope stainless strut private label stud anchors rivets and
related accessories

threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects
and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures although some
aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities the company
feels that each citys market is to some extent unique therefore the company
opens each store with minimal base stocks of inventory and then tailors the
growing inventory to the local market demand as it develops threaded fasteners
accounted for approximately 51 51 and 55 of the companys consolidated net
sales in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the other supply items included
in the fastenalr product line most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as
part of the completed anchor assembly

during the 1990s the company added eight additional product lines these
product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the original
fastenalr product line and include the following

inventory control

the company controls inventory by using computer systems to determine desired
stock levels the data used for this purpose is derived from reports showing
sales activity by stock item for the previous three years computers then
convert this data to typical store maximumminimum inventory levels for each
stock item stores can deviate from preset inventory levels as deemed
appropriate by their district managers inventories in distribution centers are
established from computerized sales data for the stores served by the respective
centers

manufacturing and support services operations

in 2000 approximately 953 of the companys consolidated net sales were
attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards
the remaining amount of approximately 47 of the companys consolidated net
sales for 2000 related to products manufactured modified or repaired by either
the companys manufacturing division or its support services the manufactured
products consist primarily of nonstandard sizes of threaded fasteners made to
customers specifications the services provided by the support services group
include but are not limited to items such as tool repair band saw blade
welding and light manufacturing the company engages in these activities
primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the
future to continue to contribute in the range of 5 to 10 of the companys
consolidated net sales

sources of supply

the company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 195000
standard stock items it distributes most items distributed by the company can
be purchased from several sources although preferred sourcing is used for some
stock items to facilitate quality control no single supplier accounted for more
than 50 of the companys purchases in 2000

                                       8

customers and marketing

the company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer
customers in small to mediumsized cities a full line of products at convenient
locations and to the high quality of the companys employees most of the
companys customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets the
construction market includes general electrical plumbing sheet metal and
road contractors the manufacturing market includes both original equipment
manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations other users of the
companys products include farmers truckers railroads mining companies
municipalities schools and certain retail trades as of december 31 2000 the
companys total number of active customer accounts defined as accounts having
purchase activity within the last 90 days was approximately 120000

during each of the three years ended december 31 2000 no one customer
accounted for a significant portion of the companys sales the company believes
that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that
they represent provide some protection to the company from economic downturns in
a particular market

a significant portion of the companys sales is generated through direct calls
on customers by store personnel because of the nature of the companys
business the company does not use the more expensive forms of mass media
advertising such as television radio and newspapers forms of advertising used
by the company include signs catalogs and direct mailings

competition

the companys business is highly competitive competitors include both large
distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located
in many of the same cities in which the company has stores the company believes
that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the companys
products are customer service and convenience

some competitors use vans to sell their products in communities away from their
main warehouses while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales the
company however believes that the convenience provided to customers by
actually operating a number of stores in smaller markets each offering a wide
variety of products is a competitive selling advantage and that the large
number of stores in a given area taken together with the companys ability to
provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution
centers makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products
having trained personnel at each store also enhances the companys ability to
compete see employees below

employees

as of december 31 2000 the company employed a total of 6477 full and part
time employees 4356 being store managers and store employees and the balance
being employed in the companys distribution centers packaging facility
manufacturing operations service operations and home office

                                       9


the company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its
ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its
ability to open new stores in new markets the company fosters the growth and
education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training
programs and by decentralizing decision making wherever possible promotions
are from within the company for example most new store managers are promoted
from an assistant managers position at another store and district managers who
supervise a number of stores are usually former store managers

the companys sales personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that
place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis while
still attaining targeted levels of gross profit as a result a significant
portion of the companys total employment cost varies with sales volume the
company also pays incentive bonuses to other personnel for achieving pre
determined cost containment goals

none of the companys employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement
and the company has experienced no work stoppages the company believes its
employee relations are excellent

than sufficient
