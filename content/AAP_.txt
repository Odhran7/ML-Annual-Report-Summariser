our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our professional and diy sales

environmental and other regulatory matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the thirdparty vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with thirdparty vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our thirdparty vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective thirdparty vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the us environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and cleanup of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including without limitation our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies ” the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects which could in turn materially affect the price of our common stock 

risks related to our operations and growth strategy 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we have identified several initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales expand margins drive accelerated growth and deliver strong relative total shareholder return we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investments to pursue our strategic initiatives if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization implementing strategic initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and may not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost these risks increase when significant changes are undertaken 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions as we expand our market presence it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across all of our locations and brands we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations the newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates 

• our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs for example during 2021 we experienced significant delays associated with our planned opening of 109 new locations in california primarily as a result of permitting challenges related to the covid19 pandemic and such delays increased our costs and resulted in significant lost sales opportunities further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term in addition to potentially incurring costs related to lease obligations we may also incur severance or other facility closure costs for stores that are closed or relocated 

omnichannel growth in our business is complex and if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our sales and results of operations could adversely be impacted 

our business has become increasingly omnichannel as we strive to deliver a seamless shopping experience to our customers through both online and instore shopping experiences operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems continuing to improve our ecommerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities attracting developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience omnichannel and ecommerce retail are competitive and evolving environments insufficient untimely or inadequately prioritized or ineffectively implemented investments could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers as well as maintain our existing ones 

enhancing the customer experience through omnichannel programs such as buyonlinepickupinstore new or expanded delivery options the ability to shop through a mobile application or other similar programs depends in part on the effectiveness of our inventory management processes and systems the effectiveness of our merchandising strategy and mix our supply chain and distribution capabilities and the timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities particularly our promotions costs associated with implementing omnichannel initiatives may be higher than expected and the initiatives may not result in increased sales including same store sales customer traffic customer loyalty or other anticipated results website downtime and other technology disruptions in our ecommerce platform including interruptions due to cyberrelated issues or natural disasters as well as supply and distribution delays and other related issues may affect the successful operation of our ecommerce platform if we are not able to successfully operate or improve our ecommerce platform and omnichannel business we may not be able to provide a relevant shopping experience or improve customer traffic sales or margins and our reputation operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations or implement joint ventures or other strategic relationships it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into strategic relationships as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic relationships involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of these acquisitions and relationships depends on a number of factors including among other things 

• our ability to continue to identify and acquire suitable targets or strategic partners or to acquire additional companies or enter into strategic relationships at favorable prices andor with favorable terms 

• our ability to obtain the full benefits envisioned by strategic transactions or relationships 

• the risk that management’s attention may be distracted 

• our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

• our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and to achieve the strategic operational financial or other anticipated synergies of the acquisition or other transaction or relationship 

• the performance our of our strategic partners 

• significant transaction or integration costs that may not be offset by the synergies or other benefits achieved in the near term or at all 

• additional operational risks such as those associated with doing business internationally or expanding operations into new territories geographies or channels that may become applicable to us and 

• loss contingencies that we may assume or become subject to whether known or unknown of acquired companies which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences 

if we experience difficulties implementing various information systems our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on information systems to facilitate the daytoday operations of the business and to produce timely accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results we are in process of implementing various information systems including additional modules within our new erp these implementations will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties with these projects any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these information systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested meaningful resources in planning project management and training additional and serious implementation issues may arise as we integrate onto these new information systems that may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on payment terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety innovation and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk our suppliers are subject to applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

our reliance on suppliers including freight carriers and other third parties in our global supply chain subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our financial results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers and place significant reliance upon various third parties to transport store and distribute those products to our distribution centers stores and customers our financial results depend on us securing acceptable terms with our suppliers for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our suppliers may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers is more difficult with suppliers for whom our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships we have established standards for product safety and quality and workplace standards that we require all our suppliers to meet we do not condone human trafficking forced labor child labor harassment or abuse of any kind and we expect our suppliers to operate within these same principles our ability to find qualified suppliers who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards can be challenging suppliers may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies if we encounter any of these issues with our suppliers our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

in addition our suppliers including those within our global supply chain are impacted by global conditions that in turn may impact our ability to source merchandise at competitive prices or timely supply product at levels adequate to meet consumer demand for example the recent surges in consumer demand shortages of raw materials and disruptions to the global supply chain resulting from lack of carrier capacity labor shortages port congestion and or closures amongst other factors have negatively impacted costs and inventory availability and may continue to have a negative impact on future results and profitability as suppliers increase prices charged to us for products including transportation and distribution as a result of these or other factors it may negatively impact our results if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued engagement services and experience of our executives and other team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future our ability to attract develop and retain an adequate number of qualified team members depends on factors such as employee morale our reputation competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages and our ability to maintain a safe working environment for example during 2021 we experienced unusually low availability of workers which we believe was primarily attributable to covid19 pandemic related factors and in turn has created increased competition in labor markets disruptions and heightened competition like those experienced during 2021 may increase our costs impact our ability to serve customers and otherwise affect our business operations we also believe our future success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel for whom the market is highly competitive particularly for individuals with certain types of technical skills failure to recruit or retain qualified employees may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities additionally turnover in executive or other key positions can disrupt progress in implementing business strategies result in a loss of institutional knowledge cause other team members to take on substantially more responsibility resulting in greater workload demands and diverting attention away from key areas of the business or otherwise negatively impact our growth prospects or future operating results 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have an adverse effect on our profitability market or government regulated increases to employee hourly wage rates along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates could have a significant impact to the profitability of our business in addition approximately 1 of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance we are subject to numerous lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products see note 13  contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination antibriberyanticorruption data privacy and income taxes compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customers suppliers team members and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy such as the california consumer privacy act which grants expanded rights to access and delete personal information and opt out of certain personal information sharing data collection and information security laws and standards could also be significant to us such laws and standards may also increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations 

despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware viruses exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams or other acts while we have experienced threats to our data and systems including phishing attacks to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material cybersecurity breach that has in any manner hindered our operational capabilities unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment our data andor our network including our supply chain while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses in any particular situation any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or our network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant operational difficulties including legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism public health issues or pandemics or the threat of any of these incidents or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers andor transporting it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east geopolitical unrest or uncertainty or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income causing an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any significant business interruptions may make it difficult or impossible to continue operations and any disaster recovery or crisis management plans we may employ may not suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant adverse impact to our business financial condition and our results of operations 

risks related to our industry and the business environment 

the covid19 pandemic may significantly and adversely impact our business operations demand for our products availability of labor access to inventory our exposure to litigation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted our business as the uncertainty volatility and disruption of a new public health crisis emerged in 2020 in our first fiscal quarter of 2020 we experienced disruption to our normal business operations from a number of factors including the need to rapidly adopt new health and safety measures significant impact to demand driven by stay at home orders and uncertainty around regulatory economic and market conditions the onset of the covid19 pandemic also created significant volatility in our stock price and may continue to create volatility which may not be reflective of our actual business and competitive position while we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations many uncertainties could still materially impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

uncertainty remains about the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including whether there will be additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases in future periods the severity and transmission rate of “variations” or future mutations of covid19 and the development efficacy distribution and adoption rates of vaccines for covid19 and variants thereof covid19 related factors could adversely impact our ability to staff our stores or distribution centers result in significant increased expenses related to store cleanings and team member benefits or negatively impact the operations of our suppliers logistics or transportation providers and our service providers or subcontractors additionally while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our team members and customers as we continue to operate during the covid19 pandemic we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments and depending on the extent and severity of the covid19 pandemic may incur significant increased operating costs associated with potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs andor workers’ compensation claims costs which could negatively affect our results of operations both during and after the covid19 pandemic 

while we have not experienced widespread store or distribution center closures it is unknown how the current administration specific locales or governmental and nongovernmental authorities of jurisdictions in which we andor our suppliers distributors and others that we do business with will respond to the continuation of the covid19 pandemic actions such as quarantine or shelterinplace measures limitations on access to unemployment compensation vaccination or testing requirements economic measures and other similar actions or requirements could cause disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers distributors or others that we do business with 

if overall demand for the products we sell declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products we sell depends on many factors and may decrease due to any number of reasons including 

• a decrease in the total number of vehicles on the road or in the number of annual miles driven or significant increase in the use of ride sharing services  because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and lower vehicle mileage which decreases the need for maintenance and repair 

• the economy  because as consumers reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair sales may decline and as new car purchases increase the number of cars requiring maintenance and repair may decrease 

• the weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles additionally overall climate changes could create greater variability in weather events which may result in greater volatility for our business or lead to other significant weather conditions that could impact our business 

• the average duration of vehicle manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers’ dealer networks using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers’ warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair 

• an increase in internetbased retailers  because potentially favorable prices and ease of use of purchasing parts via other websites on the internet may decrease the need for customers to visit and purchase their aftermarket parts from our physical stores and may cause fewer customers to order aftermarket parts on our website 

• technological advances including the rate of adoption of electric vehicles hybrid vehicles ride sharing services alternative modes of transportation autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto and the increase in the quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance or have lower part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts and in the case of electric and hybrid vehicles do not require or require less frequent oil changes and 

• the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our professional and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses regarding technological adaptation in the automotive industry 

policy makers in the us may enact legislative or regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions and encourage more rapid adoption of vehicles that minimize emissions such laws if enacted are likely to impact our business in a number of ways for example significant increases in fuel economy requirements new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect annual miles driven purchases of used vehicles that are likely to have a higher need for maintenance and repair or the relevancy of the products we sell to new vehicles coming into production we may not be able to accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions additionally compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to appropriately respond to such changes adapt our business to meet evolving demands or innovate to remain competitive could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and influenced by a number of factors including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to lower overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively in order to compete favorably we may need to increase delivery speeds and incur higher shipping costs consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success customers are increasingly shopping reading reviews and comparing products and prices online if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality as well as our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition the products we sell are brands of our vendors and our owned brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out of our control 

for the portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations or tariff rates currency fluctuations work stoppages labor strikes port delays civil unrest natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences or any unforeseen hurdles in meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels andor high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies changes in tariff rates or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs or proposed or additional tariffs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources disposable income or willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repairs for their vehicles resulting in lower sales an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

rising energy prices also directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

risks related to our common stock and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company for example in february 2018 following a significant decline in the price of our common stock a putative class action was commenced against us for which a settlement agreement covered by our insurance has been preliminarily approved by the court see “ item 3  legal proceedings ” of this annual report on form 10k such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividend payments may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as operational spending capital spending acquisitions or repayment of debt changes in cash flows tax laws and our share price could also impact our share repurchase program and other capital activities additionally decisions to return capital to stockholders including through our repurchase program or the issuance of dividends on our common stock remain subject to determination of our board of directors that any such activity is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations 

our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital 

• limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costly 

• require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtedness 

• render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

in addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings and the interest rates on future debt we issue or incur likely would be affected by our credit ratings in effect at the time such debt is issued or incurred accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility and less favorable terms on our other operating and financing arrangements including additional debt we may issue or incur in the future in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

industry update 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors many of which are similar to those affecting the overall retail industry in addition to the “ impact of covid19 on our business ” section included within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these factors include but are not limited to 

• fuel costs 

• unemployment rates 

• consumer confidence 

• competition 

• changes in new car sales 

• miles driven 

• vehicle manufacturer warranties 

• average age of vehicles in operation 

• economic and political uncertainty 

• deferral of elective automotive maintenance and improvements in new car quality 

while these factors tend to fluctuate we remain confident in the longterm growth prospects for the automotive parts industry 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



note 1 table amounts may not foot due to rounding 

note 2 fiscal years 2021 and 2019 included 52 weeks fiscal year 2020 included 53 weeks 

net sales 

net sales for 2021 were 110 billion an increase of 8917 million or 88 compared with 2020 which was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 107 resulting from strong recovery of our professional business and growth in our diy omnichannel business we experienced positive comparable store sales across every region with the southwest and west having the strongest growth net sales growth was less than comparable store sales due to 2020 including 1585 million attributable to the 53 rd week 

we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales sales to independently owned carquest stores are excluded from our comparable store sales acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening net sales for the 53 rd week in a year are not included in the comparable sales calculation for that year for example our comparable sales results for 2021 compare the 52week period in 2021 to weeks 1 through 52 reported in 2020 comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” 

gross profit 

gross profit in 2021 was 493 billion or 448 of net sales compared with 448 billion or 443 of net sales in 2020 an increase of 47 basis points the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to improvements in category management including strategic pricing and sourcing and owned brand expansion this was partially offset by ongoing inflationary costs and unfavorable channel mix 

as a result of changes in our lifo reserve an increase of 1223 million and a benefit of 138 million were included in cost of sales in 2021 and 2020 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga for 2021 was 409 billion or 372 of net sales compared with 373 billion or 369 of net sales for 2020 an increase of 26 basis points this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased labor and related payroll expenses resulting from inflationary laborrelated headwinds increased incentive compensation resulting from higher net sales and startup costs associated with our new store openings offset by a decrease in covid19 expenses the additional week in 2020 contributed 535 million to sga 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2021 was 378 million an increase of 91 million compared with 2020 this increase was primarily due to the issuance of 5000 million of our 3900 senior unsecured notes due 2030 on april 16 2020 and 3500 million of our 1750 senior unsecured notes due 2027 on september 29 2020 refer to note 6  longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

loss on early redemptions of senior unsecured notes 

during the fiftythree weeks ended january 2 2021 we incurred charges of 480 million related to the early redemption of our 2022 and 2023 senior unsecured notes refer to note 6  longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for 2021 was 1898 million compared with 1580 million for 2020 an increase of 318 million primarily due to an increase in taxable income our effective tax rate was 236 for 2021 and 243 for 2020 during 2021 the driver of the decrease in tax expense resulted from a benefit relating to sharebased awards and greater utilization of tax credits 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted eps should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows we have presented these nongaap financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude 1 lifo impacts 2 transformation expenses under our strategic business plan 3 noncash amortization related to the acquired gpi intangible assets and 4 other nonrecurring adjustments are useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance andor relate to store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

lifo impacts — beginning the first quarter of 2021 to assist in comparing our current operating results with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the impact of lifo on our results of operations is a reconciling item to arrive at nongaap financial measures 

transformation expenses — costs incurred in connection with our business plan that focuses on specific transformative activities that relate to the integration and streamlining of our operating structure across the enterprise that we do not view to be normal cash operating expenses these expenses will include but not be limited to the following 

• restructuring costs  costs primarily relating to the early termination of lease obligations asset impairment charges other facility closure costs and team member severance in connection with our voluntary retirement program and continued optimization of our organization 

• thirdparty professional services  costs primarily relating to services rendered by vendors for assisting us with the development of various information technology and supply chain projects in connection with our enterprise integration initiatives 

• other significant costs  costs primarily relating to accelerated depreciation of various legacy information technology and supply chain systems in connection with our enterprise integration initiatives and temporary offsite workspace for project teams who are primarily working on the development of specific transformative activities that relate to the integration and streamlining of our operating structure across the enterprise 

gpi amortization of acquired intangible assets — as part of our acquisition of gpi we obtained various intangible assets including customer relationships noncompete contracts and favorable lease agreements which we expect to be subject to amortization through 2025 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



1 for the 53 weeks ended january 2 2021 nongaap expenses have been adjusted to be comparable with our 2021 presentation 

2 during 2020 we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and tender premiums of 463 million and debt issuance costs of 17 million resulting from the early redemption of our 2022 and 2023 senior unsecured notes 

3 the income tax impact of nongaap adjustments is calculated using the estimated tax rate in effect for the respective nongaap adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits inventory purchases contractual obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan and other operational priorities historically we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our credit facility to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program to pay our quarterly cash dividends and for acquisitions however given uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic our future uses of cash may differ if our relative priorities including the weight we place on the preservation of cash and liquidity change typically we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our obligations for the next year we also believe such funds cash and available borrowings together with our ability to generate cash through credit facilities and notes offerings as needed will be sufficient to fund our obligations longterm cash requirements for obligations next year and beyond are discussed in the “ contractual and off balance sheet obligations ” section below 

share repurchases 

in april 2021 and november 2019 our board of directors authorized 10 billion and 7000 million for our share repurchase program on february 8 2022 our board of directors authorized an additional 10 billion toward the existing share repurchase program 

during 2021 we repurchased 46 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 8867 million or an average price of 19292 per share in connection with our share repurchase program 

we had 5455 million remaining under our share repurchase program as of january 1 2022 during 2020 we repurchased 30 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 4585 million or an average price of 15065 per share under our share repurchase program refer to “ item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matter s and issuer purchases of equity securitie s ” for further details on our share repurchase program 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital re quirements have been the funding of our investments in supply chain and information technology ecommerce and maintenance of existing stores and branches we lease approximately 83 of our stores and branches 

our capital expenditures were 2896 million in 2021 an increase of 221 million from 2020 and was primarily related to several information technology projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain and store improvements 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the timing or number of the investments we make in information technology and supply chain network initiatives and existing stores and new store development leased and owned locations within a given year in 2022 we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will range from 300 million to 350 million but may vary with business conditions 

analysis of cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

in 2021 net cash provided by operating activities increased 1426 million to 111 billion the net increase in cash flows provided by operating activities compared with the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income which was a result of our significant net sales growth related to the strong recovery of our professional business and growth in our diy omnichannel business as well as improvements in working capital in the current year working capital included an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in cash used by inventories refer to “ results of operations ” for further details on our results 

investing activities

longterm debt 

as of january 1 2022 we had a credit rating from the sp of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by the sp and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may be limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances that do not meet the requirements for offsetting in sga and that are earned based on inventory purchases are initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes periodic assessments of the accruals are performed to determine the appropriateness of the estimate and are adjusted for accordingly 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue our estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 

selfinsurance reserves 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in other longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 1 2022 would result in a change in expense of approximately 134 million for 2021 

new accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 1 2022 and january 2 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we have not historically had significant credit losses 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of our inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices during 2021 and 2020 foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including without limitation our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and “item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies” the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects which could in turn materially affect the price of our common stock 

risks related to our operations and growth strategy 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we have identified several initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investments to pursue our strategic initiatives if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization implementing strategic initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and may not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost these risks increase when significant changes are undertaken 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions as we expand our market presence it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across all of our company’s locations and brands we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations the newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates 

• our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term in addition to potentially incurring costs related to lease obligations we may also incur severance or other facility closure costs for stores that are closed or relocated 

omnichannel growth in our business is complex and if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our sales and results of operations could adversely be impacted 

our business has become increasingly omnichannel as we strive to deliver a seamless shopping experience to our customers through both online and instore shopping experiences operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems continuing to improve our ecommerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities attracting developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience omnichannel and ecommerce retail are competitive and evolving environments insufficient untimely or inadequately prioritized or ineffectively implemented investments could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers as well as maintain our existing ones 

enhancing the customer experience through omnichannel programs such as buyonlinepickupinstore new or expanded delivery options the ability to shop through a mobile application or other similar programs depends in part on the effectiveness of our inventory management processes and systems the effectiveness of our merchandising strategy and mix our supply chain and distribution capabilities and the timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities particularly our promotions costs associated with implementing omnichannel initiatives may be higher than expected and the initiatives may not result in increased sales including same store sales customer traffic customer loyalty or other anticipated results website downtime and other technology disruptions in our ecommerce platform including due to cyberrelated issues or natural disasters and supply and distribution delays and other related issues may affect the successful operation of our ecommerce platform if we are not able to successfully operate or improve our ecommerce platform and omnichannel business we may not be able to provide a relevant shopping experience or improve customer traffic sales or margins and our reputation operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations or implement joint ventures or other strategic relationships it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into strategic relationships as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic relationships involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of these acquisitions and relationships depends on a number of factors including among other things 

• our ability to continue to identify and acquire suitable targets or strategic partners or to acquire additional companies or enter into strategic relationships at favorable prices andor with favorable terms 

• our ability to obtain the full benefits envisioned by strategic transactions or relationships 

• the risk that management’s attention may be distracted 

• our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

• our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and to achieve the strategic operational financial or other anticipated synergies of the acquisition or other transaction or relationship 

• the performance our of our strategic partners 

• we may incur significant transaction or integration costs that may not be offset by the synergies or other benefits achieved in the near term or at all 

• we may become subject to additional operational risks such as those associated with doing business internationally or expanding operations into new territories geographies or channels and 

• we may assume or become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown of acquired companies which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences 

if we experience difficulties implementing various information systems including our new enterprise resource planning system “erp” our ability to conduct or business could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on information systems to facilitate the daytoday operations of the business and to produce timely accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results we are in process of implementing various information systems including a new erp these implementations will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties with these projects any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these information systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested meaningful resources in planning project management and training additional and serious implementation issues may arise as we integrate onto these new information systems that may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on payment terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk our suppliers are subject to applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

our reliance on suppliers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our financial results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers our financial results depend on us securing acceptable terms with our suppliers for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our suppliers may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers is more difficult with suppliers for whom our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships we have established standards for product safety and quality and workplace standards that we require all our suppliers to meet we do not condone human trafficking forced labor child labor harassment or abuse of any kind and we expect our suppliers to operate within these same principles our ability to find qualified suppliers who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards can be challenging suppliers may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies if we encounter any of these issues with our suppliers our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued engagement services and experience of our executives and other team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future our ability to attract develop and retain an adequate number of qualified team members depends on factors such as employee morale our reputation competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages and our ability to maintain a safe working environment we also believe our future success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel for whom the market is highly competitive particularly for individuals with certain types of technical skills failure to recruit or retain qualified employees may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities additionally turnover in executive or other key positions can disrupt progress in implementing business strategies result in a loss of institutional knowledge cause other team members to take on substantially more responsibility resulting in greater workload demands and diverting attention away from key areas of the business or otherwise negatively impact our growth prospects or future operating results 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have an adverse effect on our profitability market or government regulated increases to employee hourly wage rates along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates could have a significant impact to the profitability of our business in addition approximately one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance we are currently subject to a putative securities class action regarding past public disclosures see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k and to numerous lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products see note 13 contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination antibriberyanticorruption data privacy and income taxes compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy such as the california consumer privacy act which grants expanded rights to access and delete personal information and opt out of certain personal information sharing data collection and information security laws and standards could also be significant to us such laws and standards may also increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations 

despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware viruses exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams or other acts while we have experienced threats to our data and systems including phishing attacks to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material cybersecurity breach that has in any manner hindered our operational capabilities unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment our data andor our network including our supply chain while the company maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses in any particular situation any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or our network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant operational difficulties including legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism public health issues or pandemics or the threat of any of these incidents or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers andor transporting it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east geopolitical unrest or uncertainty or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income causing an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any significant business interruptions may make it difficult or impossible to continue operations and any disaster recovery or crisis management plans we may employ may not suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant adverse impact to our business financial condition and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

risks related to our industry and the business environment 

the covid19 pandemic may significantly and adversely impact our business operations demand for our products availability of labor access to inventory our exposure to litigation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted our business as the uncertainty volatility and disruption of a new public health crisis emerged in 2020 in our first fiscal quarter of 2020 we experienced disruption to our normal business operations from a number of factors including the need to rapidly adopt new health and safety measures significant impact to demand driven by stay at home orders and uncertainty around regulatory economic and market conditions the onset of the pandemic also created significant volatility in our stock price and may continue to create volatility which may not be reflective of our actual business and competitive position while we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations many uncertainties could still materially impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

uncertainty remains about the severity and duration of the pandemic including whether there will be additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases in future periods the severity and transmission rate of “variations” or future mutations of covid19 and the development efficacy distribution and adoption rates of vaccines for covid19 and variants thereof the risk of the spread of covid19 could adversely impact our ability to staff our stores or distribution centers result in significant increased expenses related to store cleanings and team member benefits or negatively impact the operations of our suppliers logistics or transportation providers and our service providers or subcontractors additionally while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our team members and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments and depending on the extent and severity of the pandemic may incur significant increased operating costs associated with potential increases in insurance premiums medical claims costs andor workers’ compensation claim costs which could negatively affect our results of operations both during and after the pandemic 

while we have not experienced widespread store or distribution center closures it is unknown how the current administration specific locales or governmental and nongovernmental authorities of jurisdictions in which we andor our suppliers distributors and others that we do business with will respond to the continuation of the covid19 pandemic actions such as quarantine or shelterinplace measures limitations on access to unemployment compensation economic measures and other governmental orders could cause disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers distributors or others that we do business with 

if overall demand for the products we sell declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may decrease due to any number of reasons including 

• a decrease in the total number of vehicles on the road or in the number of annual miles driven or significant increase in the use of ridesharing services  because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and lower vehicle mileage which decreases the need for maintenance and repair 

• the economy  as consumers reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair sales may decline and as new car purchases increase the number of cars requiring maintenance and repair may decrease 

• the weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles 

• the average duration of vehicle manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles being driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers’ dealer networks using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers’ warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles 

• an increase in internetbased retailers  because potentially favorable prices and ease of use of purchasing parts via other websites on the internet may decrease the need for customers to visit and purchase their aftermarket parts from our physical stores and may cause fewer customers to order aftermarket parts on our website 

• technological advances such as battery electric vehicles and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance or have lower part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts and in the case of battery electric vehicles do not require oil changes and 

• the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our professional and diy customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and influenced by a number of factors including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to lower overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively in order to compete favorably we may need to increase delivery speeds and incur higher shipping costs consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success customers are increasingly shopping reading reviews and comparing products and prices online if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our owned private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out of our control 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations or tariff rates currency fluctuations work stoppages labor strikes port delays civil unrest natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences or any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy 

in addition preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities further increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our team members and customers increase vulnerability to information technology or cybersecurity related risks as more of our team members work remotely and otherwise continue to disrupt our business operations 

even after the pandemic has subsided we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of economic volatility or changes to the macroeconomic environment that have occurred or may occur the pandemic could also amplify other risks and uncertainties described herein 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies changes in tariff rates or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs or proposed or additional tariffs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources disposable income or willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair for their vehicles resulting in lower sales an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

rising energy prices also directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

risks related to our common stock and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company for example in february 2018 following a significant decline in the price of our common stock a putative class action was commenced against us see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividend payments may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as operational spending capital spending acquisitions or repayment of debt changes in cash flows tax laws and our share price could also impact our share repurchase program and other capital activities additionally decisions to return capital to shareholders including through our repurchase program or the issuance of dividends on our common stock remain subject to determination of our board of directors that any such activity is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations 

our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital 

• limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costly 

• require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtedness 

• render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

in addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the section titled “part 1 item 1a risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

impact of covid19 on our business 

during the covid19 pandemic we continued to prioritize the health safety and wellbeing of our team members and customers worked to drive financial performance by preserving our cash position scrutinized planned spending and the prioritization of various initiatives and worked to help ensure that when the current period of crisis passes our team will emerge even stronger 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have continued to take additional measures to help ensure the health safety and wellbeing of our team members and customers such measures include retrofitting our stores with plexiglass care shields the continuation of certain laborrelated benefits for team members social distancing practices sanitation practices the use of health check screenings and offering contactless delivery 

government imposed restrictions and stay at home orders related to the pandemic occurred during our first quarter of 2020 these contributed to negative impacts to demand primarily during the last six weeks of the sixteen weeks ended april 18 2020 however as the second and third quarters of 2020 progressed we experienced a significant improvement in demand particularly in our diy omnichannel business while government restrictions began to tighten again in the fourth quarter of 2020 we still experienced increased demand resulting in increased comparable store sales 

in addition to external factors we believe the execution of prioritized internal initiatives including our new marketing campaign and providing a variety of shopping choices for customers with our advance same day options contributed to driving demand and the improvement in our results we have also continued to make progress on the execution of our key supply chain initiatives including crossbanner replenishment and our single warehouse management system 

despite the increase in net sales during the fiftythree weeks ended january 2 2021 the covid19 pandemic remains an evolving situation we continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our team members customers suppliers and stockholders 

management overview 

net sales increased 41 in 2020 as compared to 2019 which was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 24 resulting from growth in our diy omnichannel business with the remaining increase attributable to 2020 including a 53 rd week of operations versus only 52 weeks of operations in 2019 we experienced positive comparable store sales across every region with southeast florida and central having the strongest growth our west mid atlantic and northeast regions had the lowest comparable sales growth 

we generated diluted earnings per share “diluted eps” of 714 during 2020 compared to 684 in 2019 when adjusted for the following nonoperational items our adjusted diluted earnings per share “adjusted eps” in 2020 was 851 compared to 819 during 2019

industry update 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors many of which are similar to those affecting the overall retail industry in addition to the “impact of covid19 on our business” section included within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these factors include but are not limited to 

• fuel costs 

• unemployment rates 

• consumer confidence 

• competition 

• changes in new car sales 

• miles driven 

• vehicle manufacturer warranties 

• average age of vehicles in operation 

• economic and political uncertainty 

• deferral of elective automotive maintenance and improvements in new car quality 

while these factors tend to fluctuate we remain confident in the longterm growth prospects for the automotive parts industry

the year ended january 2 2021 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2019 net sales for 2020 were 101 billion an increase of 3973 million or 41 from net sales in 2019 this increase primarily reflected the impact of our positive comparable store sales 24 resulting from growth in our diy omnichannel business as well as 1585 million of net sales attributable to the additional week in 2020 we experienced positive comparable store sales across every region with southeast florida and central having the strongest growth our west mid atlantic and northeast regions had the lowest comparable sales growth 

we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales sales to independently owned carquest stores are excluded from our comparable store sales acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening net sales for the 53 rd week in a year are not included in the comparable sales calculation for that year for example our comparable sales results for 2020 compare weeks 1 through 52 in 2020 to the 52week period reported for 2019 comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap”  

gross profit 

gross profit for 2020 was 45 billion or 443 of net sales as compared to 43 billion or 438 of net sales in 2019 an increase of 52 basis points the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to favorable channel mix growth in our diy omnichannel business operational productivity relating to our ability to leverage our supply chain inventory management including a decrease in inventory shrink and favorable pricing actions 

as a result of changes in our last in first out “lifo” reserve a benefit of 138 million an expense of 1013 million and a benefit of 398 million were included in cost of sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

sga for 2020 was 37 billion or 369 of net sales as compared to 36 billion or 368 of net sales for 2019 an increase of 8 basis points this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased marketing spend on advertising lease termination costs as we optimize our real estate footprint and higher supplies and cleaning costs related to covid19 the additional week in 2020 contributed 535 million to sga 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2020 was 469 million an increase of 70 million when compared to 2019 this increase was primarily due to the issuance of our 5000 million 2030 senior unsecured notes on april 16 2020 and our 3500 million 2027 senior unsecured notes on september 29 2020  refer to note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

loss on early redemptions of senior unsecured notes 

during the fiftythree weeks ended january 2 2021 we incurred charges of 480 million related to the early redemption of our 2022 and 2023 senior unsecured notes during the fiftytwo weeks ended december 28 2019 we incurred charges of 108 million related to the early redemption of our 2020 senior unsecured notes refer to note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for 2020 was 1580 million as compared to 1509 million for 2019 an increase of 71 million primarily due to an increase in taxable income our effective tax rate was 243 for 2020 and 237 for 2019 during 2019 the driver of the lower tax expense resulted from a benefit relating to a release of a valuation allowance that was previously established against the deferred tax asset related to our federal foreign tax credit carryforward 

2019 compared to 2018 

a discussion of changes in our results of operations in 2019 compared to 2018 has been omitted from this form10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 filed with the sec on february 18 2020 which is available free of charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and at wwwadvanceautopartscom by clicking “investor relations” located at the bottom of the home page 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted eps should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows we have presented these nongaap financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude transformation expenses under our strategic business plan and noncash amortization related to the acquired gpi intangible assets and other nonrecurring adjustments are useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance andor relate to store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

transformation expenses — costs incurred in connection with our business plan that focuses on specific transformative activities that relate to the integration and streamlining of our operating structure across the enterprise that we do not view to be normal cash operating expenses these expenses will include but not be limited to the following 

• restructuring costs  costs primarily relating to the early termination of lease obligations asset impairment charges other facility closure costs and team member severance in connection with our 2018 store rationalization plan and 2017 store and supply chain rationalization plan 

• thirdparty professional services  costs primarily relating to services rendered by vendors for assisting us with the development of various information technology and supply chain projects in connection with our enterprise integration initiatives 

• other significant costs  costs primarily relating to accelerated depreciation of various legacy information technology and supply chain systems in connection with our enterprise integration initiatives and temporary offsite workspace for project teams who are primarily working on the development of specific transformative activities that relate to the integration and streamlining of our operating structure across the enterprise 

gpi amortization of acquired intangible assets — as part of our acquisition of gpi we obtained various intangible assets including customer relationships noncompete contracts and favorable leases agreements which we expect to be subject to amortization through 2025 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



1 during the sixteen weeks ended april 20 2019 we made an outofperiod correction which increased cost of sales by 130 million related to receiv ed not invoiced inventory 

2 during the twelve weeks ended october 3 2020 we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and tender premiums of 463 million and debt issuance costs of 17 million resulting from the early 

redemption of our 2022 and 2023 notes during the sixteen weeks ended april 20 2019 we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and debt iss uance costs of 101 million and 07 million resulting 

from the early redemption of our 2020 senior unsecured notes

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits inventory purchases contractual obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan and other operational priorities historically we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our credit facility to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program to pay our quarterly cash dividends and for acquisitions however given uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic our future uses of cash may differ if our relative priorities including the weight we place on the preservation of cash and liquidity change typically we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our obligations for the next year 

share repurchases 

on november 8 2019 our board of directors authorized a 7000 million share repurchase program as an addition to the previous 4000 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in august 2019 

during 2020 we repurchased 30 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 4585 million or an average price of 15065 per share in connection with our share repurchase program we had 4322 million remaining under our share repurchase program as of january 2 2021 during 2019 we repurchased 34 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 4874 million or an average price of 14423 per share under our share repurchase program 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital re quirements have been the funding of our investments in supply chain and information technology ecommerce and maintenance of existing stores and branches we lease approximately 84 of our stores and branches 

our capital expenditures were 2676 million in 2020 a decrease of 26 million from 2019 our capital expenditures were primarily related to several information technology projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain and store improvements 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the timing or number of the investments we make in information technology and supply chain network initiatives and existing stores and new store development leased and owned locations within a given year in 2021 we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will range from 275 million to 325 million but may vary with business conditions 

analysis of cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

for 2020 net cash provided by operating activities increased 1028 million to 9697 million the net increase in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income improvements in working capital and the deferral of payroll taxes under the cares act in the current year working capital included an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accounts payable and an increase in cash used by inventories refer to “results of operations” for further details on our results 

for 2019 net cash provided by operating activities increased 559 million to 8669 million the net increase in operating cash flows compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income which was partially offset by a decrease in working capital 

investing activities 

for 2020 net cash used in investing activities decreased by 1960 million to 2669 million compared to 2019 cash used in investing activities for 2020 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment which was comparable to capital expenditures in 2019 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 is attributable to the diehard ® brand acquisition on december 23 2019 which we purchased for a cash purchase price of 2000 million 

for 2019 net cash used in investing activities increased by 2711 million to 4629 million compared to 2018 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the acquisition of the diehard ® brand on december 23 2019 for a cash purchase price of 2000 million this purchase gave us the right to sell diehard ® batteries and enables us to extend the diehard ® brand into other automotive and vehicular categories additionally the remaining increase was in capital expenditures related to several it projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain ecommerce and store improvements 

financing activities 

for 2020 net cash used in financing activities decreased by 5962 million to 2860 million compared to 2019 this decrease was primarily a result of the net proceeds of 2445 million received in 2020 that resulted from the issuance of our 5000 million 2030 senior unsecured notes on april 16 2020 and our 3500 million 2027 senior unsecured notes on september 29 2020 offset by the redemption of all of our 3000 million 2022 senior unsecured notes on september 16 2020 and the cash tender offer on september 29 2020 for a portion of the 2023 senior secured notes in 2019 we used 3100 million to redeem all 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 senior unsecured notes 

for 2019 net cash used in financing activities increased by 6182 million to 8822 million compared to 2018 this increase was primarily a result of returning cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends as well as on february 28 2019 we redeemed all 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 notes we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and debt issuance costs of 101 million and 07 million resulting from the early redemption of our 2020 notes 

our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend since 2006 any payments of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash flows capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors on february 10 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per share to be paid on april 2 2021 to all common shareholders of record as of march 19 2021 

longterm debt 

as of january 2 2021 we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may be limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

for additional information on transactions entered into relating to longterm debt during the fiftythree weeks ended january 2 2021 refer to note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of january 2 2021 other than as disclosed in note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments and note 8 leases and other commitments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including interest payments on our senior unsecured notes revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our contractual obligations table our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of january 2 2021 were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  note 8 lease and other commitments  note 12 income taxes  note 13 contingencies  and note 14 benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

1 longterm debt represents the principal amount of our senior unsecured notes which become due in 2023 2027 and 2030 

2 we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments that are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the applicable lease term any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 

3 includes the longterm portion of deferred income taxes and other liabilities including selfinsurance reserves for which no contractual payment schedule exists as we expect the payments to occur beyond 12 months from january 2 2021 the related balances have not been reflected in the “payments due by period” section of the table 

4 purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory except for amounts that are offset in sga when circumstances exist as described below these deferred amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue our estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 

selfinsurance reserves 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 2 2021 would result in a change in expense of approximatel y 144 million for 2020 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see “ recently issued accounting pronouncements” in note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

the following is a description of the terms and conditions of the guarantees with respect to all senior unsecured notes for which advance auto parts inc “issuer” is an issuer or provides full and unconditional guarantee 

certain 100 wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of the issuer including our material subsidiaries as defined in the 2017 credit agreement serve as guarantors “guarantor subsidiaries” of our senior unsecured notes the subsidiary guarantees related to our senior unsecured notes are full and unconditional and joint and several and there are no restrictions on the ability of the issuer to obtain funds from its guarantor subsidiaries certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries including all of our foreign subsidiaries and captive insurance subsidiary do not serve as guarantors of our senior unsecured notes “nonguarantor subsidiaries” 

the following tables present summarized financial information for the issuer and guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after elimination of i intercompany transactions and balances among the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries and ii equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiaries that are a nonguarantor subsidiary 

summarized financial information 



1 current assets incl udes 43186 million and 42342 million of inventories as of january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 

2 noncurrent assets includes 15859 m illion and 16138 million of goodwill and intangible assets net as of january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 2 2021 and december 28 2019 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we have not historically had significant credit losses 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of our inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices during 2020 2019 and 2018 foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our professional and diy sales 

team members 

as of december 28 2019  we employed approximately 39000 fulltime team members and approximately 28000 parttime team members our workforce consisted of 83 of our team members employed in storelevel operations 13 employed in distribution and 4 employed in our corporate offices as of december 28 2019  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions

competition 

we operate in both the professional and diy markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa o’reilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe  jack and auto plus formerly uniselect usa inc ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our thirdparty vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective thirdparty vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the us environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and cleanup of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including without limitation our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and “item 7management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies” the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and future prospects which could in turn materially affect the price of our common stock 

if overall demand for the products we sell declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and influenced by a number of factors including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to lower overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively in order to compete favorably we may need to increase delivery speeds and incur higher shipping costs consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success customers are increasingly shopping reading reviews and comparing products and prices online if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our owned private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we have identified several initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investments to pursue our strategic initiatives if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization implementing strategic initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and may not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost these risks increase when significant changes are undertaken 

our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out of our control 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations or tariff rates currency fluctuations work stoppages labor strikes port delays civil unrest natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences or any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we expand our market presence through various means it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across all of our company’s locations and brands we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations the newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates 

• our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term in addition to potentially incurring costs related to lease obligations we may also incur severance or other facility closure costs for stores that are closed or relocated 

omnichannel growth in our business is complex and if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our customers our sales and results of operations could adversely be impacted 

our business has become increasingly omnichannel as we strive to deliver a seamless shopping experience to our customers through both online and instore shopping experiences operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a costeffective basis and our ability to operate support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and other related operational systems continuing to improve our ecommerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities attracting developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience omnichannel and ecommerce retail are competitive and evolving environments insufficient untimely or inadequately prioritized or ineffectively implemented investments could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers as well as maintain our existing ones 

enhancing the customer experience through omnichannel programs such as buyonlinepickupinstore new or expanded delivery options the ability to shop through a mobile application or other similar programs depends in part on the effectiveness of our inventory management processes and systems the effectiveness of our merchandising strategy and mix our supply chain and distribution capabilities and the timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities particularly our promotions costs associated with implementing omnichannel initiatives may be higher than expected and the initiatives may not result in increased sales including same store sales customer traffic customer loyalty or other anticipated results additionally declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from brick and mortar stores to digital platforms could lead to store closures restructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows website downtime and other technology disruptions in our ecommerce platform including due to cyberrelated issues or natural disasters and supply and distribution delays and other related issues may affect the successful operation of our ecommerce platform if we are not able to successfully operate or improve our ecommerce platform and omnichannel business we may not be able to provide a relevant shopping experience or improve customer traffic sales or margins and our reputation operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations or implement joint ventures or other strategic relationships it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into strategic relationships as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions joint ventures and other strategic relationships involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of these acquisitions and relationships depends on a number of factors including among other things 

   

if we experience difficulties implementing various information systems including our new enterprise resource planning system “erp” our ability to conduct or business could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on information systems to facilitate the daytoday operations of the business and to produce timely accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results we are in process of implementing various information systems including a new erp these implementations will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties with these projects any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these information systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested meaningful resources in planning project management and training additional and serious implementation issues may arise as we integrate onto these new information systems that may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels if we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on payment terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

our reliance on suppliers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our financial results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers our financial results depend on us securing acceptable terms with our suppliers for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our suppliers may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers is more difficult with suppliers for whom our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships we have established standards for product safety and quality and workplace standards that we require all our suppliers to meet we do not condone human trafficking forced labor child labor harassment or abuse of any kind and we expect our suppliers to operate within these same principles our ability to find qualified suppliers who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards can be challenging suppliers may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies if we encounter any of these issues with our suppliers our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies changes in tariff rates or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs or proposed or additional tariffs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources disposable income or willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair for their vehicles resulting in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

rising energy prices also directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members depends on factors such as employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages we also believe our future success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel for whom the market is highly competitive particularly for individuals with certain types of technical skills failure to recruit or retain qualified employees may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities additionally turnover in executive or other key positions can disrupt progress in implementing business strategies result in a loss of institutional knowledge cause other team members to take on substantially more responsibility resulting in greater workload demands and diverting attention away from key areas of the business or otherwise negatively impact our growth prospects or future operating results 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have an adverse effect on our profitability market increases to employee hourly wage rates along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates could have a significant impact to the profitability of our business in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company for example in february 2018 following a significant decline in the price of our common stock a putative class action was commenced against us see item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividend payments may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as operational spending capital spending acquisitions or repayment of debt changes in cash flows tax laws and our share price could also impact our share repurchase program and other capital activities additionally decisions to return capital to shareholders including through our repurchase program or the issuance of dividends on our common stock remain subject to determination of our board of directors that any such activity is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations 

our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

in addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance we are currently subject to a putative securities class action regarding past public disclosures see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k and to numerous lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products see note 13 contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination antibriberyanticorruption data privacy and income taxes compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated 

despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware viruses exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams or other acts while we have experienced threats to our data and systems including phishing attacks to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material cybersecurity breach that has in any manner hindered our operational capabilities unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment our data andor our network including our supply chain while the company maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses in any particular situation any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or our network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant operational difficulties including legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism public health issues or pandemics or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers andor transporting it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east geopolitical unrest or uncertainty or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income causing an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any significant business interruptions may make it difficult or impossible to continue operations and any disaster recovery or crisis management plans we may employ may not suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant adverse impact to our business financial condition and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



note table amounts may not foot due to rounding 

2019 compared to 2018 

net sales 

net sales for 2019 were 97090 million  an increase of 1284 million or 13  from net sales in 2018  this increase was primarily due to our comparable store sales growth of 11  our growth in both net sales and comparable store sales was driven by improvements in our professional business and increased sales in several product categories including parts and batteries and accessories and chemicals 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2019 was 42547 million or 438 of net sales as compared to 42194 million or 440 of net sales in 2018  a decrease of 22 basis points the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the impact of the launch of our enhanced loyalty program initiatives during 2019 as well as unfavorable adjustments needed to state our inventories at last in first out we made an outofperiod correction in 2019 which increased cost of sales by 130 million related to received not invoiced inventory these reductions in margin were partially offset by operational productivity relating to our ability to leverage our supply chain and continued improvements in inventory management driven by our cross banner replenishment initiative 

as a result of changes in our last in first out “lifo” reserve an expense of 1013 million  a credit of 398 million and an expense of 27 million were included in cost of sales in 2019  2018 and 2017  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

sga for 2019 was 35776 million or 368 of net sales as compared to 36151 million or 377 of net sales for 2018  a decrease of 89 basis points this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our continued focus on expense management as evidenced by a reduction in labor related costs and insurance and claims costs due to our continued focus on team member safety partially offsetting these improvements we incurred additional expenses related to information technology as we focus on digital capabilities and integrate our technology platforms across the enterprise and increases in minimum wages and planned merit increases 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2019 was 399 million  a decrease of 167 million when compared to 2018  this decrease was primarily due to the early redemption of our 2020 senior unsecured notes refer to “liquidity and capital resources” for further details 

other income net 

other income net for 2019 was 05 million  a decrease of 71 million when compared to 2018  this decrease was primarily due to incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and debt issuance costs of 101 million and 07 million resulting from the early redemption of our 575 senior unsecured notes due 2020 “2020 notes” 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for 2019 was 1509 million  as compared to 1314 million for 2018  an increase of 194 million primarily due to an increase in taxable income our effective tax rate was 237 for 2019 and 2018  while our effective tax rate remained essentially flat from 2019 to 2018 we recognized nonrecurring benefits in both years during 2019 we recognized a benefit relating to a release of a valuation allowance that was previously established against the deferred tax asset related to our federal foreign tax credit carryforward during 2018 we identified a change in estimate to amounts previously estimated in 2017 for the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability and nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that resulted in a net tax benefit of 57 million

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” nongaap financial measures including adjusted net income and adjusted eps should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows we have presented these nongaap financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude 1 transformation expenses under our strategic business plan 2 nonoperational expenses associated with the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation 3 noncash amortization related to the acquired gpi intangible assets 4 other nonrecurring adjustments and 5 nonrecurring impact of the act is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance andor relate to the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

transformation expenses — we expect to recognize a significant amount of transformation expenses over the next several years in connection with our business plan that involves a holistic and integrated transformation of the entire company these expenses will include but not be limited to restructuring costs store closure costs and thirdparty professional services and other significant costs to integrate and streamline our operating structure across the enterprise we are focused on several areas throughout advance such as supply chain and information technology 

gpi integration and store closure and consolidation expenses — our multiyear plan to integrate the operations of gpi that we acquired in 2014 with advance substantially ended in 2018 due to the size of this acquisition we considered these expenses to be outside of our base business we believed providing additional information in the form of nongaap measures that excluded these costs was beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration was complete in addition to integration expenses we incurred store closure and consolidation expenses that consisted of expenses associated with our plans to convert and consolidate the carquest stores acquired from gpi while periodic store closures are common these closures represented a significant program outside of our typical market evaluation process we believe it was useful to provide additional nongaap measures that excluded these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance 

gpi amortization of acquired intangible assets — as part of our acquisition of gpi we obtained various intangible assets including customer relationships noncompete contracts and favorable leases agreements which we expect to be subject to amortization through 2025 

us tax reform — on december 22 2017 the act was signed into law the act amends the internal revenue code of 1986 by among other things permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 from the existing maximum rate of 35 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries during 2018 and in conjunction with the completion of our 2017 us income tax return we identified a change in estimate in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 to amounts previously estimated for the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability and nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings foreign subsidiaries our analysis under staff accounting bulletin no 118 is complete 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits inventory purchases contractual obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes and funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and debt securities as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next year 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our investments in supply chain and information technology ecommerce and maintenance of existing stores and branches we lease approximately 84 of our stores and branches 

our capital expenditures were 2701 million in 2019  an increase of 764 million from 2018  this increase in capital expenditures related to several information technology projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain and store improvements 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the timing or number of the investments we make in information technology and supply chain network initiatives and existing stores and new store development leased and owned locations within a given year in 2020  we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will range from 275 million to 325 million but may vary with business conditions 

analysis of cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

for 2019  net cash provided by operating activities increase d 559 million to 8669 million  the net increase in operating cash flows compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income which was partially offset by a decrease in working capital refer to “results of operations” for further details on our results 

for 2018  net cash provided by operating activities increase d 2102 million to 8110 million  the net increase in operating cash flows compared to the prior year was primarily driven by our focus on working capital management including an increase in accounts payable partially offset by increases in receivables net and inventories 

investing activities 

for 2019  net cash used in investing activities increased by 2711 million to 4629 million compared to 2018  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures related to several it projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain ecommerce and store improvements in addition on december 23 2019 we purchased the diehard® brand for a cash purchase price of 2000 million this purchase gives us the right to sell diehard® batteries and enables us to extend the diehard® brand into other automotive and vehicular categories 

for 2018  net cash used in investing activities increased by 132 million to 1918 million compared to 2017  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures related to several information technology projects including our finance enterprise resource planning system as well as investments in supply chain ecommerce and store improvements 

financing activities 

for 2019  net cash used in financing activities increase d by 6182 million to 8822 million compared to 2018  this increase was primarily a result of returning cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends as well as on february 28 2019 we redeemed all 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 notes we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and debt issuance costs of 101 million and 07 million resulting from the early redemption of our 2020 notes 

for 2018  net cash used in financing activities increased by 2490 million to 2639 million compared to 2017  this increase was primarily a result of returning cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends 

our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend since 2006 any payments of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations cash flows capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors on february 12 2020  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per share to be paid on april 3 2020 to all common shareholders of record as of march 20 2020  

longterm debt 

as of december 28 2019  we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement our borrowing availability was 10 billion and we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

on february 28 2019 we redeemed all 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 notes that were issued in april 2010 at 99587 of the principal amount we incurred charges relating to a makewhole provision and debt issuance costs of 101 million and 07 million resulting from the early redemption of our 2020 notes which are included in other expense income net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 

share repurchases 

on august 7 2019 our board of directors authorized a 4000 million share repurchase program to replace the previous 6000 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in august 2018 which had 491 million remaining at the time of its replacement on november 8 2019 our board of directors authorized 7000 million as an addition to the existing share repurchase program 

during 2019 and in connection with our share repurchase programs we repurchased 34 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 4874 million  we had 8908 million remaining under our stock repurchase program as of december 28 2019  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 28 2019  other than as disclosed in note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments and note 8 leases and other commitments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including interest payments on our senior unsecured notes revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our contractual obligations table our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of december 28 2019 were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 6 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  note 8 lease and other commitments  note 12 income taxes  note 13 contingencies  and note 14 benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory except for amounts that are offset in sga when circumstances exist as described below these deferred amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue our estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 

selfinsurance reserves 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 28 2019 would result in a change in expense of approximately 151 million for 2019  

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see “ recently issued accounting pronouncements” in note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we have not historically had significant credit losses 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of our inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices during 2019  2018 and 2017 foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our professional and diy sales

competition 

we operate in both the professional and diy markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa o’reilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe  jack and auto plus formerly uniselect usa inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independently owned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our thirdparty vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective thirdparty vendors

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for the products we sell declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and influenced by a number of factors including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to lower overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively in order to compete favorably we may need to increase delivery speeds and incur higher shipping costs consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success customers are increasingly shopping reading reviews and comparing products and prices online if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

 6 

competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for a description of select initiatives see note 4 exit activities and other initiatives of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out or our control 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations or tariff rates currency fluctuations work stoppages labor strikes port delays civil unrest natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences or any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we expand our market presence through various means it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across all of our company’s locations and brands we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations the newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates 

• our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term in addition to potentially incurring costs related to lease obligations we may also incur severance or other facility closure costs for stores that are closed or relocated 

 7 

if we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of our acquisitions depends on a number of factors including among other things 

   

if we experience difficulties implementing various information systems including our new enterprise resource planning system “erp” our ability to conduct or business could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on information systems to facilitate the daytoday operations of the business and to produce timely accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results we are in process of implementing various information systems including a new erp these implementations will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties with these projects any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these information systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business while we have invested meaningful resources in planning project management and training additional and serious implementation issues may arise as we integrate onto these new information systems that may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels if we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on payment terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

 8 

our reliance on suppliers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our financial results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers our financial results depend on us securing acceptable terms with our suppliers for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our suppliers may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers is more difficult with suppliers for whom our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships we have established standards for product safety and quality and workplace standards that we require all our suppliers to meet we do not condone human trafficking forced labor child labor harassment or abuse of any kind and we expect our suppliers to operate within these same principles our ability to find qualified suppliers who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards can be challenging suppliers may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies if we encounter any of these issues with our suppliers our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies changes in tariff rates or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs or proposed or additional tariffs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources disposable income or willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair for their vehicles resulting in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

rising energy prices also directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

in addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 10 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance we are currently subject to a putative securities class action regarding past public disclosures see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report and to several lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products see note 14 contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination and income taxes compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated 

despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware viruses exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams or other acts while we have experienced threats to our data and systems including phishing attacks to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material cybersecurity breach that has in any manner hindered our operational capabilities unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment our data andor our network including our supply chain any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or our network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant operational difficulties including legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

 11 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

 hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers andor transporting it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income causing an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such failure including plans for disaster recovery if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our effective income tax rate was 237  and 86  for 2018  and 2017  the increase  in our effective tax rate for 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily related to the net tax benefit of 1438 million  related to the act that was recorded in 2017 this was partially offset by the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 due to the enactment of the act which favorably impacted our net income for 2018  by 777 million  or 105  per diluted share during the third quarter of 2018 in conjunction with the completion of our 2017 us income tax return we identified a change in estimate to amounts previously recorded for the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability and nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a net tax benefit of 57 million  our accounting for the impact of the act under staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” was completed as of the third quarter of 2018

2017  compared to 2016 

net sales 

net sales for 2017  were 93738 million  a decline  of 1939 million  or 20  over net sales for 2016  this decrease  was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline  of 20  and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated during 2017  we consolidated 16 stores and closed 50 stores which was partially offset by the opening of 60 new stores our decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decrease in overall transactions in 2017 and mild summer weather conditions which was partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value and favorable weather in the fourth quarter of the year that drove a stronger demand across the business 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2017  was 40850 million  or   436   of net sales as compared to   42559 million  or   445   of net sales in   2016    a decrease   of   90   basis points   the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by unfavorable commodity prices and the negative impact related to the continued inventory optimization efforts partially offset by continued material cost improvement 

sga 

sga for 2017  was 35148  million or 375  of net sales as compared to 34683  million or 363  of net sales for 2016  an increase  of 125  basis points this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with our transformation plan and higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and higher medical costs partially offsetting these costs were lower gpi integration and store closure and consolidation expenses in 2017 compared to the prior year and continued focus on expense management throughout the year 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2017  was 588 million  as compared to 599 million  in 2016  the decrease in interest expense was due to lower outstanding balances of our credit facilities during 2017 as compared to 2016 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2017  was 448 million  as compared to 2792 million  for 2016  our effective income tax rate was 86  and 378  for 2017  and 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a net 1438 million benefit related to the act 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows we have presented these nongaap financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude 1 nonoperational expenses associated with the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation 2 noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangible assets 3 transformation expenses under our strategic business plan and 4 nonrecurring impact of the act is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance andor relate to the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

 19 

gpi integration and store closure and consolidation expenses —we acquired gpi in 2014 and are progressing in our multiyear plan to integrate the operations of gpi with aap due to the size of the acquisition we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business therefore we believe providing additional information in the form of nongaap measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is complete in addition to integration expenses we incur store closure and consolidation expenses that consist of expenses associated with our plans to convert and consolidate the carquest stores acquired from gpi while periodic store closures are common these closures represent a significant program outside of our typical market evaluation process we believe it is useful to provide additional nongaap measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance we also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our nongaap measures 

transformation expenses —we expect to recognize a significant amount of transformation expenses over the next several years as we transition from integration of our aapcqus businesses to a plan that involves a more holistic and integrated transformation of the entire company including wp and ai these expenses will include but not be limited to restructuring costs store closure costs and thirdparty professional services and other significant costs to integrate and streamline our operating structure across the enterprise we are focused on several areas throughout advance such as supply chain and information technology 

us tax reform —on december 22 2017 the act was signed into law the act amends the internal revenue code of 1986 by among other things permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 from the existing maximum rate of 35 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries during the third quarter of 2018 and in conjunction with the completion of our 2017 us income tax return we identified a change in estimate in accordance with sab 118 to amounts previously estimated for the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability and nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings foreign subsidiaries 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits inventory purchases contractual obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes and funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and debt securities as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next year 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our investments in supply chain and information technology “it” ecommerce and maintenance of existing stores we lease approximately 84  of our stores 

our capital expenditures were 1937  million in 2018  an increase  of 40 million  from 2017  this increase  in capital expenditures related to several it projects including our finance enterprise resource planning tool as well as investment in supply chain and store improvements 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the timing or number of the investments we make on it and supply chain network initiatives and existing stores and new store development leased and owned locations within a given year in 2019  we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will range from 250  million to 300  million but may vary with business conditions 

analysis of cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

for 2018  net cash provided by operating activities increase d 2102 million  to 8110 million  the net increase in operating cash flows compared to the prior year was primarily driven by our focus on working capital management including an increase in accounts payable partially offset by increases in receivables net and inventories 

for 2017  net cash provided by operating activities increase d 775 million  to 6008 million  this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of payments within working capital our inventory balance as of december 30 2017 decreased 1574 million or 36 over the prior year primarily driven by the focus on inventory optimization across the company 

 21 

investing activities 

for 2018  net cash used in investing activities increased by 132 million  to 1918 million  compared to 2017  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures related to several it projects including our finance enterprise resource planning tool as well as investments in supply chain ecommerce and store improvements 

for 2017  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 834 million  to 1786 million  compared to 2016  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment 

financing activities 

for 2018  net cash used in financing activities increase d by 2490 million  to 2639 million  this increase  was primarily a result of returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends 

for 2017  net cash used in financing activities decrease d by 2023 million  to 149 million  this decrease  was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year 

longterm debt 

as of december 29 2018  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

on january 29 2019 we notified wells fargo bank na as trustee of our intent to redeem all 3000  million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 575  notes due 2020 for detailed information refer to note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

stock repurchases   

on august 8 2018 the companys board of directors authorized a 600 million  stock repurchase program under this authorization the company repurchased 17 million  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 2728 million  during 2018 we had 3272  million remaining under our stock repurchase program as of december 29 2018  

subsequent to december 29 2018  we have repurchased 08 million  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1272 million  through our stock repurchase program 

offbalancesheet arrangements   

as of december 29 2018  other than as disclosed in note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments and interest payments on our senior unsecured notes revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

 22 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our contractual obligations table our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of december 29 2018  were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  note 12 income taxes  note 13 lease commitments  note 14 contingencies  and note 15 benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein   

 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level effective in the third quarter of 2017 we realigned our three geographic divisions which included the operations of the stores operating under the advance auto parts carquest and autopart international trade names into two us geographic divisions as a result of this realignment and change in the operating structure of its carquest independent and carquest canada businesses we now have five operating segments as each operating segment represents a reporting unit goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach 

 23 

our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if a reporting unit’s fair value has historically significantly exceeded its carrying value then a riskbased market approach of determining the reporting unit’s fair value is utilized we use a valuation specialist to determine the fair value for the remaining reporting units if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 

our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

we complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates royalty rates and terminal growth rates if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

inventory reserves 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for managing slower moving inventory we establish reserves when the expected net proceeds are less than carrying value 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 29 2018  would result in a change in expense of approximately 95 million for 2018  

selfinsurance reserves 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 29 2018  would result in a change in expense of approximately 154 million for 2018  

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

 24 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see “ recently issued accounting pronouncements”  in note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 29 2018  and december 30 2017  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we have not historically had significant credit losses 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of our inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices during 2018  2017  and 2016 foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our professional and diy sales 

team members 

as of december 30 2017  we employed approximately 40000  fulltime team members and approximately 31000  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 86  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 10  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices as of december 30 2017  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions we have never experienced any labor disruption

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and cleanup of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for the products we sell slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 



 6 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independently owned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to less overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 

 7 

our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out or our control 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences andor any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we expand our market presence through various means it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across our entire company’s locations and brands we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations the newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates 

• our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores in addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term 

we also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions an element of our growth strategy acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of our acquisitions depends on a number of factors including among other things 

   

 8 

if we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels if we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

 9 

our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

in addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

 10 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers’ willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair for their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination and income taxes compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated 

despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware andor viruses exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams or other acts unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment andor network any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

 11 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

 hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers andor transporting it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income causing an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such failure including plans for disaster recovery if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the section entitled “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

management overview 

we generated diluted earnings per share “diluted eps” of 642  during 2017  compared to 620  for 2016  comparable store sales were down   20  in 2017  the lower than expected sales performance was driven by the following factors 

 

the softness in the industry over the last year resulted from higher gas prices and a significantly lower number of new cars sold during 2008 and 2009 resulting in an abnormal trough of vehicles of that age and their typical parts maintenance items and accessories needs our analysis shows that shortterm volatility is not unusual in the industry we have completed a number of transformation actions in 2017 including the restructuring and reduction in the number of advance auto parts “aap” and carquest us “cqus” store regions implementation of improved pricing discipline in our stores and reduction in inventory while we believe these actions are needed for the long term there were some shortterm disruption impacts during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 despite stronger performance in our western and southern markets we experienced softness in our cooling parts and chemicals category sales across many of our other markets as a result of the milder summer weather partially offsetting the softness in our aapcqus business was the performance of certain aspects of our professional and canadian businesses which grew their sales during the year as well as an increased demand in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from more favorable winter weather 

our operating profit margin reflects deliberate choices to invest in our business and improve productivity over the long term despite the sales softness we believe these investments are necessary as we build a foundation for sustainable longterm performance improvement 

when adjusted for the following nonoperational items our adjusted diluted earnings per share “adjusted eps” in 2017  was 537  compared to 715  during 2016

business update   

we continue to make progress on the various elements of our strategic business plan which is focused on improving the customer experience and driving consistent execution for both professional and diy customers to achieve these improvements we have undertaken planned transformation actions to help build a foundation for longterm success across the entire company these transformation actions initiated during 2017  include 

 

industry update   

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors many of which are similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to 

 

while these factors tend to fluctuate we remain confident in the longterm growth prospects for the automotive parts industry

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



2017  compared to 2016 

net sales 

net sales for 2017  were 93738 million  a decline  of 1939  million or 20  from net sales in 2016  this decrease  was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline  of 20  during 2017  we consolidated 16  stores and closed 50  stores which was partially offset by the opening of 60  new stores our decline  in comparable store sales was driven by a decrease in overall transactions in 2017  and mild summer weather conditions which was partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value and favorable weather in the fourth quarter of the year that drove a stronger demand across the business 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2017  was 40850  million or 436  of net sales as compared to 42559  million or 445  of net sales in 2016  a decrease  of 90  basis points the decrease  in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by unfavorable commodity prices and the negative impact related to the continued inventory optimization efforts partially offset by continued material cost improvement 

sga 

sga for 2017  were 35148  million or 375  of net sales as compared to 34683  million or 363  of net sales for 2016  an increase  of 125  basis points this increase  as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the continued transformation plan and higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and higher medical costs partially offsetting these costs were lower gpi integration store closure and consolidation costs and expenses in 2017  compared to the prior year and continued focus on expense management throughout the year 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2017  was 588  million as compared to 599  million in 2016  the decrease  in interest expense was due to lower outstanding balances of our credit facilities during 2017  as compared to 2016  

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2017  was 448  million as compared to 2792 million for 2016  our effective income tax rate was 86  and 378  for 2017  and 2016  the decrease  in our effective tax rate for 2017  compared to 2016  is primarily due to a net 1438 million  benefit related to the act refer to discussion in note 12 income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information relating to impact of the act in 2017  

 19 

2016  compared to 2015 

net sales 

net sales for 2016  were 95677 million  a decline  of 1693 million  or 17  over net sales for 2015  this decrease  was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline  of 14  and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated during 2016  we consolidated 159 stores and closed 23 stores which was partially offset by the opening of 78 new stores our decline  in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in overall transactions partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value while the number of comparable store transactions decreased from the comparable period in all four quarters of 2016 we saw improving trends in the second half of the year 

our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by challenges with product availability and service levels particularly in our northeast and great lakes markets on a quarterly basis our comparable store sales decreased 19 41 and 10 in the first second and third quarters of 2016 and increased 31 in the fourth quarter of 2016 we attribute the improvement in our comparable store sales in the last half of the year to our efforts to improve our focus on the customer including sustained investments in availability customer service and incentives for front line employees as well as improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain we also benefited in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the timing of the christmas and new years holidays 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2016  was 42559 million  or   445   of net sales as compared to   44228 million  or   454   of net sales in   2015    a decrease   of   94   basis points the   decrease   in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by significantly higher inventory levels in the first half of 2016 and disruption in our distributions centers located in our northeast and great lakes markets resulting from changes in delivery frequency 

sga 

sga for 2016  was 34683  million or 363  of net sales as compared to 35970  million or 369  of net sales for 2015  a decrease  of 69  basis points this decrease  as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower gpi integration store closure and consolidation and support center restructuring costs in 2016  compared to the prior year excluding these costs sga decrease d 14  basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs partially offset by higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and inventory availability support costs 

operating income 

operating income for 2016  was 7876 million  representing 82  of net sales as compared to 8258 million  or 85  of net sales for 2015  a decrease  of 25  basis points this decrease  was due to a lower gross profit rate partially offset by a decrease in our sga rate these changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2016  was 599 million  as compared to 654 million  in 2015  the decrease  in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2016  was 2792 million  as compared to 2795 million  for 2015  our effective income tax rate was 378  and 371  for 2016  and 2015  our income tax rate in both 2016  and 2015  reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations the increase  in our effective tax rate for 2016  compared to 2015  is primarily due to 78 million of settlements recorded in 2016 related to income tax audits of gpi for time periods prior to our acquisition of gpi these settlements were largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with gpi and therefore recorded corresponding income of 73 million in other income net 

 20 

net income 

net income was 4596 million  or 620  per diluted share for 2016  as compared to 4734 million  or 640  per diluted share for 2015  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2016  was 48  as compared to 49  for 2015  the decrease  in diluted eps was driven primarily by the decrease in net income 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows we have presented these nongaap financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude 1 nonoperational expenses associated with the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation costs 2 noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangibles 3 transformation expenses under our strategic business plan and 4 nonrecurring impact of the act is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance andor relate to the integration of gpi and store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

gpi integration expenses —we acquired gpi for 208 billion in 2014 and are in the midst of a multiyear plan to integrate the operations of gpi with aap this includes the integration of product brands and assortments supply chain and information technology the integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years the integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015 which our focus then shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems due to the size of the acquisition we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business therefore we believe providing additional information in the form of nongaap measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is complete 

store closure and consolidation expenses —store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with our plans to convert and consolidate the carquest stores acquired from gpi the conversion and consolidation of the carquest stores is a multiyear process that began in 2014 as of december 30 2017 346  carquest stores acquired from gpi had been consolidated into existing aap stores and 422  stores had been converted to the aap format while periodic store closures are common these closures represent a major program outside of our typical market evaluation process we believe it is useful to provide additional nongaap measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance we also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our nongaap measures 

transformation expenses —we expect to recognize a significant amount of transformation expenses over the next several years as we transition from integration of our aapcqus businesses to a plan that involves a more holistic and integrated transformation of the entire company across all four banners including worldpac and ai these expenses will include but not be limited to restructuring costs thirdparty professional services and other significant costs to integrate and streamline our operating structure across the enterprise we focused our initial transformation efforts on our aapcqus field structure in the second quarter and are reviewing other areas throughout the company such as supply chain and information technology 

us tax reform —on december 22 2017 the act was signed into law the act amends the internal revenue code by among other things permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 from the existing maximum rate of 35 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the reduction to the corporate tax rate which is effective on january 1 2018 the company is required to revalue deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period of enactment the company also recorded an estimated charge to income tax expense for the nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and it is the company’s intention to bring back the accumulated foreign earnings held as cash in the near term 

 21 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits inventory purchases contractual obligations capital expenditures payment of income taxes and funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next year 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments in supply chain and information technology we lease approximately 84  of our stores our capital expenditures were 1898  million in 2017  a decrease  of 698 million  from 2016  this decrease  in capital expenditures was due to disciplined capital spending by the company to focus on priority projects in an effort to optimize cash flow for 2017 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new store development leased and owned locations within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology and supply chain network in 2018  we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will be up to 250  million but may vary with business conditions 

 22 

analysis of cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

for 2017  net cash provided by operating activities increase d 775 million  to 6008 million  this net increase  in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of payments within working capital our inventory balance as of december 30 2017  decreased 1574 million  or 36  over the prior year primarily driven by the focus on inventory optimization across the company 

for 2016  net cash provided by operating activities decrease d 1793 million  to 5233 million  this net decrease  in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable lower net income and the timing of payments within working capital partially offset by the timing of income tax deductions our inventory balance as of december 31 2016  increased 1511 million or 36 over the prior year driven mainly by the buildup of transitional inventory associated with our carquest product and store integration and the opening of new locations including a new worldpac distribution center 

investing activities 

for 2017  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 834 million  to 1786 million  compared to 2016  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment 

for 2016  net cash used in investing activities increased by 87 million  to 2620 million  compared to 2015  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used for purchases of property and equipment 

financing activities 

for 2017  net cash used in financing activities decrease d by 2022 million  to 149 million  this decrease  was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year 

for 2016  net cash used in financing activities decrease d by 2419 million  to 2171 million  this decrease  was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year 

longterm debt 

for detailed information refer to note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

as of december 30 2017  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

 23 

offbalancesheet arrangements   

as of december 30 2017  other than as disclosed in note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments and interest payments on our notes revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our contractual obligations table our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of december 30 2017  were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 7 longterm debt and fair value of financial instruments  note 12 income taxes  note 13 lease commitments  note 14 contingencies  and note 15 benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein   

 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

 24 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level effective in the third quarter of 2017 the company realigned its three geographic divisions which included the operations of the stores operating under the advance auto parts carquest and autopart international trade names into two us geographic divisions as a result of this realignment and change in the operating structure of its carquest independent and carquest canada businesses the company has increased its number of operating segments from four to five as each operating segment represents a reporting unit goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach 

our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if a reporting unit’s fair value has historically significantly exceeded its carrying value then a riskbased market approach of determining the reporting unit’s fair value is utilized the company uses a valuation specialist to determine the fair value for the remaining reporting units if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 

our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi in 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

we complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates royalty rates and terminal growth rates if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

inventory reserves 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for managing slower moving inventory we establish reserves when the expected net proceeds are less than carrying value 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 30 2017  would result in a change in expense of approximately 111 million for 2017  

selfinsurance reserves 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

 25 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 30 2017  would result in a change in expense of approximately 153 million for 2017  

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 30 2017  would result in a change in deferred incentives of approximately 179 million for 2017  

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects if any on our consolidated financial statements see “ recently issued accounting pronouncements”  in note 2 significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we have not historically had significant credit losses 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of the company’s inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices during 2017  and 2016  foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income

store development 

our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores and branches within existing markets where we can achieve a larger presence remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets the addition of new locations along with strategic acquisitions has played a significant role in our growth and success we believe the opening of new stores and their strategic location in relation to our professional and diy customers will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 

we open and operate stores in both large denselypopulated markets and small less denselypopulated areas we complete substantial research prior to entering a new market key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics traffic count vehicle profile number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate 

our 5189  stores and branches were located in the following states territories and international locations as of december 31 2016

the following table sets forth information concerning changes in the total number of our stores and branches during the past five years 



 

store technology 

our stores utilize operating systems comprised of an integrated pos system and epc which enable our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year make model and engine type of their vehicles historically we have operated separate legacy store systems for advance auto parts and carquest stores under our strategic business plan we have begun the rollout of a single pos and epc that leverages the benefits of each system team members can check the quantity of onhand inventory for any sku adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available the store system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our supply chain network or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors parts and accessories are then ordered electronically with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time 

the worldpac speeddial ®  parts catalog and fulfillment ordering system provides expanded capabilities to worldpacs professional customers and other stores throughout our enterprise this tool allows customers to check realtime parts availability on over 110000 parts view images on over 85000 parts check prices place orders view invoices and submit selfservice returns 

store support centers 

we serve our advance auto parts and carquest stores primarily from our store support centers in roanoke va and raleigh nc we also maintain a store support center in newark ca to support our worldpac and ecommerce operations and in norton ma to support our autopart international stores 

merchandising in 2016  we purchased merchandise from over 500  vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 8  of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

our merchandising teams have developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilize a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will appeal to our professional customers and also generate diy customer traffic since our acquisition of gpi we have rolled out crosssourcing capabilities to the majority of our stores and have substantially completed the integration of our product offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores some of our brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  denso ®  gates ®  moog ®  monroe ®  ngk ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers

these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  autopart international ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ® as well as the carquest ® brand acquired from gpi 

supply chain   our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers hubs stores and branches which enable us to provide sameday or nextday availability to our customers as of december 31 2016  we operated 50  distribution centers ranging in size from approximately 55000  to 665000  square feet with total square footage of approximately 108 million  currently our smaller distribution centers primarily service our carquest stores acquired with gpi including those that have converted to the advance auto parts format while our larger distribution centers primarily service advance auto parts autopart international and worldpac locations in 2016 we closed one distribution center in sutton ma and opened one new worldpac distribution center in the greater dallas tx area we also plan to open a new distribution center in the greater nashville tn area in 2017 

we tailor the delivery frequency from our distributions centers to our stores and branches to the demands of our local markets we also utilize hubs and other inmarket strategies to increase inmarket parts availability and decrease ordertodelivery time while at the same time reducing inventory and days on hand in addition we utilize crosssourcing of inventory between most of our enterprisewide locations to expand availability and the breadth of our product offerings to better meet the needs of our customers 

our inventory management teams utilize replenishment systems to monitor inventory levels across the network and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment systems utilize the most uptodate information from our pos systems as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand these factors are combined with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 

our strategic initiatives include streamlining our entire supply chain infrastructure to build new capabilities to improve availability delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs we plan to begin simplifying and fully integrating our advance auto parts and carquest networks by 2018 which will include the implementation of a single information technology system this optimization will improve product availability drive productivity through reducing the number of miles from the distribution center to the store and simplify our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the chain

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our professional and diy sales 

team members 

as of february 23 2017  we employed approximately 41000  fulltime team members and approximately 33000  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 87  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 9  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices as of february 23 2017  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions we have never experienced any labor disruption we believe that our team member relations are solid 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including advance auto parts” “autopart international” “carquest “carquest technical institute” “driverside” “motologic” “motoshop” “worldpac” “speeddial” and “technet professional auto service” for use in connection with the automotive parts business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the professional and diy markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa oreilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe  jack and auto plus formerly uniselect usa inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and 

 8 

common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for the products we sell slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the professional and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

 9 

these potential competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to professional and diy customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

we have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both professional and diy customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition adverse changes in our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy through new store openings targeted acquisitions and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

store growth 

we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open and operate more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions including our 2014 acquisition of gpi involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations the success of our acquisitions depend on a number of factors including among other things 

 

 10 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the efficiency and capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences we continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems as we integrate gpi and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels if we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increase in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members as of february 23 2017  we employed approximately 74000  team members we may not be able to retain our current executives and other key team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and a downgrade in our credit ratings or deterioration in global credit markets or general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 11 

level of indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

impact of changes in credit ratings and credit market uncertainty 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements 

conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in its financial condition an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

 12 

impact on operating costs 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination breach of laws or regulations including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements discrimination labor and employment and income taxes the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and added costs on an ongoing basis 

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware andor viruses team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled social engineering attacks and phishing scams or other acts unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members’ or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment andor network while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

 13 

 hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers’ disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions ghg for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new federal or state restrictions on emissions that may be imposed on vehicles could also adversely affect annual miles driven or the demand for the products we sell and lead to changes in automotive technology changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including litigation relating to employment or arising from claims of discrimination as a result of claims by current and former team members or others although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders the damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition future results of operations or cash flow 

our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including but not limited to automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and their material suppliers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits the automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts the plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the pending cases against us and our subsidiaries are in early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and our liability if any could vary widely as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company or its subsidiaries in the future if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows in future periods

refer to reconciliation of nongaap financial measures for further details of our comparable adjustments and the usefulness of such measures to investors 

total sales for 2016 decreased 17  from 2015 and comparable store sales decreased 14  our sales were negatively impacted in 2016 by challenges with inventory availability and service levels we are making investments to better serve our customers accelerate sales momentum and gain market share while these investments have pressured our operating margins we began to experience improvements in our comparable store sales trends towards the end of the year our first priority is to stabilize sales growth to consistently deliver positive comparable store sales performance and then turn our attention to bottom 

 20 

line profitability margins we remain confident in the longterm growth and profitability opportunity as we balance our investments in the business with productivity measures to expand margins 

2016  highlights 

a highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from 2016  include 

 

refer to “consolidated results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”  for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively 

business update   

our focus in 2017 is to regain top line sales growth as the first step towards driving sustainable longterm financial performance improvement under the leadership of our ceo who joined the company in april 2016 we have evaluated all facets of our business in conjunction with the development of a strategic business plan that is intended to significantly improve our customer service and financial performance over the next five years our first priority is to refocus on the customer by implementing and reinforcing the best drivers for improving customer satisfaction once we stabilize the drivers to consistently deliver an outstanding experience for our customers and consistent positive comparable store sales performance we will turn our attention to bottom line profitability margins 

the underlying framework of this plan focuses on growth productivity people and culture the growth and margin expansion elements of our strategic business plan include i supply chain ii professional iii diy and iv productivity 

supply chain  by 2018 we plan to begin rolling out new supply chain capabilities that will enhance inventory positioning in our network improve assortment and inmarket availability and improve speed and accuracy of delivery over the longerterm we will continue to further streamline our supply chain network and systems from the gpi acquisition to enable a more seamless inventory transfer throughout the entire chain across both company owned and independent stores driving productivity the gpi integration plan has been fully embedded in our strategic business plan 

professional   for our professional customers our focus is on providing high quality parts improved product availability consistency of service and fast delivery we believe we have the right parts assortment and are focused on improving sales and customer service capabilities we will continue to leverage best practices and technology platforms including market differentiators like technet and the carquest and worldpac training institutes across all of our professional businesses to simplify the customer experience 

diy   we are also focused on growing sales to diy customers we are strengthening our speedperks program to build stronger loyalty we have also initiated test markets for diy designed to improve the customer experience in the store online and at each touchpoint this includes more focused and enhanced training along with investments in mobile and digital to better serve our customers when and where they want to be served 

productivity  our productivity agenda will focus on removing unnecessary costs while driving new capabilities and investing in longterm growth creation our productivity pipeline is sequenced over the five year horizon of our strategic business plan we are not simply cutting costs to drive shortterm profit results but are materially changing our processes to drive permanent cost reductions 

 21 

this agenda will be supported and executed with a focus on our talent and culture throughout our company we are hard at work evolving our culture to one which is focused on the customer and driving high levels of accountability ownership and a drive for results throughout the organization 

automotive aftermarket industry 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2017 as continued lower fuel costs a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increase 

we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available from the federal highway administration the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased by approximately 30 in 2016 which we attribute primarily to decreased gasoline prices longterm industry forecasts remain favorable as lower gas prices and continued strength in the labor market are expected to result in an annual miles driven growth rate of 2 through 2019 

number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age 

we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for the products we sell within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to both routine maintenance requirements and more frequent mechanical failures during 2016 the number of registered vehicles grew 24 to a record 264 million vehicles according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 278 million vehicles by 2019 the average vehicle age which has exceeded 11 years for the past five years also points to favorable growth in the industry despite continued growth in new car registrations the vehicle scrappage rate for 2016 fell to its lowest rate in 14 years resulting in an increase in number of older vehicles on the road as reflected by a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate is 41 for vehicles over 11 years old compared to a compounded annual growth rate for all vehicles of 11 we believe that the average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longerterm as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increased complexity of automobiles

store development 

we serve our professional and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth details of our store and branch development activity for the year ended december 31 2016  including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with professional delivery programs in addition to the changes in our store counts detailed below we relocated 47  of our stores during 2016  during 2017  we anticipate adding approximately 75 to 85 new stores and branches 



1 includes activity for stores acquired with bwp distributors inc that operate under the carquest trade name 

2   consolidated stores include carquest stores whose operations were consolidated into existing aap locations as a result of the planned integration of carquest in 2014 we began the multiyear process of consolidating and converting our carquest stores into aap locations 

3   converted stores include carquest stores that were rebranded as an aap store as a result of the planned integration of carquest 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our store and branch locations to both our professional and diy customers sales from our ecommerce websites and sales to independentlyowned carquest branded stores sales are recorded net of discounts and rebates sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales sales to independentlyowned carquest branded stores are excluded from our comparable store sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date approximately one year comparable store sales growth for 2014 and 2015 excludes sales from the 53 rd  week of 2014 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses including depreciation and amortization gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs and mix of professional and diy sales see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

 23 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses acquisition and integration related expenses professional delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expenses store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs depreciation and amortization closed facility expense and impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



2016  compared to 2015 

net sales 

net sales for 2016  were 95677 million  a decline of 1693  million or 17  from net sales in 2015  this decrease was primarily due to our comparable store sales decline of 14  and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated during 2016 we consolidated 159  stores and closed 23  stores which was partially offset by the opening of 78  new stores our decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in overall transactions partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value while the number of comparable store transactions decreased from the comparable period in all four quarters of 2016 we saw improving trends in the second half of the year 

our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by challenges with product availability and service levels particularly in our northeast and great lakes markets on a quarterly basis our comparable store sales decreased 19 41 and 10 in the first second and third quarters of 2016 respectively and increased 31 in the fourth quarter of 2016 we attribute the improvement in our comparable store sales in the last half of the year to our efforts to improve our focus on the customer including sustained investments in availability customer service and incentives for front line employees as well as improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain we also benefited in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the timing of the christmas and new years holidays 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2016  was 42559  million or 445  of net sales as compared to 44228  million or 454  of net sales in 2015  a decrease of 94  basis points the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by significantly higher inventory levels in the first half of 2016 and disruption in our distributions centers located in our northeast and great lakes markets resulting from changes in delivery frequency 

 24 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2016  were 34683  million or 363  of net sales as compared to 35970  million or 369  of net sales for 2015  a decrease of 69  basis points this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower gpi integration costs store closure and consolidation expenses and support center restructuring costs in 2016 compared to the prior year excluding these costs sga decreased 14  basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs partially offset by higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and inventory availability support costs 

operating income 

operating income for 2016  was 7876  million representing 82  of net sales as compared to 8258  million or 85  of net sales for 2015  a decrease of 25  basis points this decrease was due to a lower gross margin rate partially offset by a decrease in our sga rate these changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2016  was 599  million or 06  of net sales as compared to 654  million or 07  of net sales in 2015  the decrease in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2016  was 2792  million as compared to 2795 million for 2015  our effective income tax rate was 378  and 371  for 2016  and 2015  respectively our income tax rates in both 2016  and 2015  reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations the increase in our effective tax rate for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to 78 million of settlements recorded in 2016 related to income tax audits of gpi for time periods prior to our acquisition of gpi we believe these settlements will be largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with gpi and therefore recorded corresponding income of 73 million in other income net 

net income 

net income was 4596  million or 620  per diluted share for 2016  as compared to 4734  million or 640  per diluted share for 2015  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2016  was 48  as compared to 49  for 2015  the decrease in diluted eps was driven primarily by the decrease in net income 

2015  compared to 2014 

net sales 

net sales for 2015  were 97370 million  a decline of 1068 million  or 11  over net sales for 2014  this decrease was primarily due to the 53 rd  week of 2014 which contributed 1504 million in sales to 2014 excluding the impact of the 53 rd  week net sales for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 while comparable store sales were flat the slight increase in net sales when excluding the 53 rd  week is due to the addition of 121 new stores partially offset by the portion of sales that did not transfer from the consolidation of 111 stores and closure of 89 stores during 2015 

our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by disruptions from integration activities including the alignment of our field structure products and pricing in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our canadian operations reduced comparable store sales for the year by 36 basis points partially offsetting these negative impacts is an estimated 50 basis points of positive contribution from the sales transferred to comparable stores from stores consolidated during 2015 our fourth quarter of 2015 was our weakest quarter in terms of comparable store sales with a decline of 25  the unseasonably warm start to winter impacted both our professional and diy business particularly in batteries and cold weatherrelated hard parts categories such as starters alternators and related products   

gross profit 

gross profit for 2015  was 44228 million  or 454  of net sales as compared to 44536 million  or 452  of net sales in 2014  an increase of 18  basis points the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lower product acquisition costs inclusive of merchandise synergies as a result of the acquisition of gpi 

 25 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2015  were 35970 million  or 369  of net sales as compared to 36019 million  or 366  of net sales for 2014  an increase of 35  basis points this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in gpi integration costs store closure and consolidation expenses and support center restructuring costs excluding these costs sga decreased 18 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs and incentive compensation as well as lower delivery costs as fuel prices had declined these benefits were partially offset by expense deleverage as a result of softer sales 

operating income 

operating income for 2015  was 8258 million  representing 85  of net sales as compared to 8517 million  or 87  of net sales for 2014  a decrease of 17  basis points this decrease was due to a higher sga rate partially offset by an increase in our gross profit rate these changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2015  was 654 million  or 07  of net sales as compared to 734 million  or 07  of net sales in 2014  the decrease in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2015  was 2795 million  as compared to 2876 million  for 2014  our effective income tax rate was 371  and 368  for 2015  and 2014  respectively our income tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations 

net income 

net income was 4734 million  or 640  per diluted share for 2015  as compared to 4938 million  or 671  per diluted share for 2014  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2015  was 49  as compared to 50  for 2014  the decrease in diluted eps was driven primarily by the decrease in net income 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe the presentation of financial results that exclude noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangibles and nonoperational expenses associated with i the integration of gpi ii store closure and consolidation costs and iii support center restructuring costs is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size nature and significance and relate to the integration of gpi and store closure activity in excess of historical levels these measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry the disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures are useful to investors as a supplement to the gaap measures 

gpi integration expenses   as disclosed in our filings with the sec we acquired gpi for 208 billion on january 2 2014 and are in the midst of a multiyear integration plan to integrate the operations of gpi with advance auto parts this includes the integration of product brands and assortments supply chain and information technology the integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years the integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015 and our focus has shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems beginning in 2016 due to the size of the acquisition we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business therefore we believe providing additional information in the form of nongaap measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is completed 

 26 

store closure and consolidation expenses   store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with our announced plans to i convert and consolidate the carquest stores acquired from gpi ii close our autopart international stores in florida and iii close approximately 80 underperforming advance auto parts stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the conversion and consolidation of the carquest stores is a multiyear process that began in 2014 as of december 31 2016  333  carquest stores acquired from gpi had been consolidated into existing advance auto parts stores and 282  stores had been converted to the advance auto parts format as of december 31 2016  we operated 608  stores under the carquest name the closure of the 40 autopart international stores in florida primarily in the first quarter of 2015 and closure of 80 underperforming advance auto parts stores in the fourth quarter of 2015 significantly exceeded our average historical store closure activity while periodic store closures are common these closures represent major programs outside of our typical market evaluation process we believe it is useful to provide additional nongaap measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance we also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our nongaap measures 

support center restructuring expenses   the costs excluded for support center restructuring activities include costs associated with i closing our minnesota office and relocating functions to existing offices ii relocating functions within our roanoke va office and raleigh nc office formerly the headquarters for gpi and iii eliminating duplicative functions between these two offices these actions are a direct consequence of the acquisition and integration of gpi and therefore we do not consider these expenses to be normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business these actions were substantially completed as of the end of fiscal 2015 and we have had no material store support center restructuring expenses following the end of fiscal 2015 

we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following tables

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures the payment of income taxes and funding of our strategic business plan in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict the liquidity needs for our domestic operations 

as of december 31 2016  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1352 million  an increase of 444 million  compared to january 2 2016  this increase in cash was primarily a result of net cash generated from operations partially offset by capital expenditures and net repayments on credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2016  activity to 2015  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

as of december 31 2016  our outstanding indebtedness was 10433 million  consisting primarily of our senior unsecured notes this is 1636 million  lower when compared to january 2 2016  as a result of net payments on our credit facility as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings under our term loan or revolving credit facility we had 1007 million  in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 8993 million  as of december 31 2016  

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores investments in supply chain and information technology and gpi integration expenditures we lease approximately 84  of our stores our capital expenditures were 2596  million in 2016  an increase of 248 million  from 2015  

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi in 2017  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2500 million  but may vary with business conditions these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and systems we anticipate opening between 75 to 85 stores and branches during 2017

stock repurchases

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for 2016  2015  and 2014  are reflected in the following table and discussion 



operating activities 

for 2016  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1888 million  to 5009 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable lower net income and the timing of payments within working capital partially offset by the timing of income tax deductions our inventory balance as of december 31 2016  increased 1511 million  or 36  over the prior year driven mainly by the buildup of transitional inventory associated with our carquest product and store integration that began to drop by the end of the year and the opening of new locations including a new worldpac distribution center 

for 2015  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 193 million to 6896 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by lower net income the timing of income tax deductions and an increase in cash outflows from inventory purchases net of accounts payable our inventory balance as of january 2 2016  increased 2378 million or 60 over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and branches these decreases in cash flow were partially offset by increases in cash flow from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of rent and other payments to nonmerchandise vendors 

investing activities 

for 2016  net cash used in investing activities increased by 87 million  to 2620 million  compared to 2015 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used for purchases of property and equipment 

for 2015  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 20349 million to 2534 million  compared to 2014 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of gpi during 2014 

financing activities 

for 2016  net cash used in financing activities decreased by 2513 million  to 1947 million  this decrease was primarily a result of lower net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan than in the prior year 

 29 

for 2015  net cash used in financing activities increased by 10219 million to 4460 million  this increase was primarily a result of net repayments on the revolving credit facility and term loan 

longterm debt 

bank debt 

as of december 31 2016  we had a credit agreement the 2013 credit agreement which provided a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility with advance stores company inc advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the revolving credit facility also provided for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we could request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed 2500 million  by those respective lenders up to a total commitment of 125 billion  during the term of the 2013 credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance were permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 credit agreement under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the revolving credit facility terminated in december 2018 the 2013 credit agreement previously included a term loan that was repaid in full during 2016 

as of december 31 2016  under the 2013 credit agreement we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolver as of december 31 2016  we had letters of credit outstanding of 1007 million  which reduced the availability under the revolver to 8993 million  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin a facility fee was charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the facility fee rate as of december 31 2016 was 015  per annum under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the interest rate and facility fee were subject to change based on our credit rating 

the 2013 credit agreement contains customary covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio and minimum consolidated coverage ratio and are further described in note 7 longterm debt  to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we were in compliance with our covenants with respect to the 2013 credit agreement as of december 31 2016  

subequent to the end of 2016 on january 31 2017 we entered into a new credit agreement which provides a 1 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the “2017 credit agreement” with advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and bank of america na administrative agent the agent this new revolver under the 2017 credit agreement replaced the revolver under the 2013 credit agreement the new revolver provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 2000 million  we may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 2500 million  during the term of the 2017 credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving loan balance if any are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2017 credit agreement 

the interest rates on outstanding amounts if any on the revolving facility under the 2017 credit agreement will be based at our option on an adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin after an initial interest period we may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type the initial margins per annum for the revolving loan are 110  for the adjusted libor and 010 for alternate base rate borrowings a facility fee of 015 per annum will be charged on the total revolving facility commitment payable quarterly in arrears under the terms of the 2017 credit agreement the interest rate spread facility fee and commitment fee will be based on our credit rating the revolving facility terminates in january 2022 however we may request one or two oneyear extensions of the termination date prior to the first or second anniversary of the closing date 

the 2017 credit agreement contains customary covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio and minimum consolidated coverage ratio and are further described in note 7 longterm debt  to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

as of december 31 2016  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in 

 30 

addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

senior unsecured notes 

at december 31 2016  our outstanding senior notes consisted of i 450 million  of 450  notes maturing in december 2023 the “2023 notes” ii 300 million  of 450  notes maturing in january 2022 the “2022 notes” and iii 300 million  of 575  notes maturing in may 2020 the “2020 notes” or collectively with the 2023 notes and the 2022 notes “the notes” the 2023 notes bear interest at a rate of 450  per year payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year

offbalancesheet arrangements   

we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 263 million  as of december 31 2016  these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of december 31 2016  we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  were as follows

applicable lease term any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 

 

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of december 31 2016  our goodwill balance was allocated to four reporting units effective in the second quarter of 2016 we realigned our operating segments resulting in a reevaluation of our reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 

our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

we complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates 

the carrying value of goodwill was 9909 million  and 9895 million  at december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets was 3355 million  and 3347 million  at december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively the increase to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2016 was due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit or asset group exceeded the carrying values of the respective goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset and therefore no impairment existed we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material 

 32 

change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

income tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 31 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 36 million  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 906 million  704 million  and 494 million  respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2016 was primarily related to an increase in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported product and an increase in our shrink reserve based on timing of our cycle counts and a slight increase in our shrinkage rate the increase in our inventory reserves in 2015 was primarily due to estimated shrink on a higher volume of product returns associated with our product changeovers and conversions and increases to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported product 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted in the majority of our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 31 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 56 million  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  

 33 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 1406 million  1340 million  and 1370 million  respectively our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three years 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 31 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 87 million  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 2111 million  and 2107 million  as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 31 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 131 million  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

 34 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 31 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 29 million  for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate risk 

our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances and have designated these hedges as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2016  

the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or term loan however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575  450  and 450  respectively per annum 

credit risk 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary foreign currency exposure arises from our canadian operations and the translation of canadian dollar denominated revenues profits and net assets into us dollars during 2016  the translation of the operating results of our canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income we view our investments in the canadian subsidiaries as longterm and any changes in our net assets in the canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of the companys inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances we believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices gains from foreign currency transactions which are included in other income net were 07 million  during 2016

store development 

our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores and branches within existing markets where we can achieve a larger presence remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets the addition of new locations along with strategic acquisitions has played a significant role in our growth and success we believe the opening of new stores and their strategic location in relation to our commercial and diy customers will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 

we open and operate stores in both large denselypopulated markets and small less denselypopulated areas we complete substantial research prior to entering a new market key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics traffic count vehicle profile number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate

our 5293  stores and branches were located in the following states territories and international locations as of january 2 2016  



the following table sets forth information concerning changes in the total number of our stores and branches during the past five years

store technology 

our stores utilize operating systems comprised of an integrated pos and epc which enable our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year make model and engine type of their vehicles currently we operate separate legacy store systems for advance auto parts and carquest stores in conjunction with our integration of the advance auto parts and carquest stores we plan to begin testing a single pos and epc that leverages the benefits of each system during 2016 

currently information maintained by our advance auto parts store operating system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly it also provides realtime inventory tracking at the store level allowing store team members to check the quantity of onhand inventory for any sku adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our advance auto parts stores the store system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our supply chain network or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time 

the worldpac speeddial ®  parts catalog and fulfillment ordering system provides expanded capabilities to worldpacs commercial customers and other stores throughout our enterprise this tool allows customers to check realtime parts availability on over 110000 parts view images on over 85000 parts check prices place orders view invoices and selfservice returns 

store support centers 

we serve our advance auto parts and carquest stores primarily from our store support centers in roanoke va and raleigh nc we also maintain a store support center in newark ca to support our worldpac and ecommerce operations and in norton ma to support our autopart international stores 

merchandising   in 2015  we purchased merchandise from over 500  vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 7  of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

our merchandising teams have developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilize a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will appeal to our commercial customers and also generate diy customer traffic since our acquisition of gpi we have rolled out crosssourcing capabilities to the majority of our stores and have substantially completed the integration of our product offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores some of our brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  denso ®  gates ®  moog ®  monroe ®  ngk ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  autopart international ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ® as well as the carquest ® brand acquired from gpi 

supply chain    our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers hubs stores and branches which enable us to provide sameday or nextday availability to our customers our inventory management teams utilize replenishment systems to monitor inventory levels across the network and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment systems utilize the most uptodate information from our pos systems as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand these factors are combined with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 

the acquisition of gpi in 2014 significantly increased the number of distribution centers that we operate as of january 2 2016  we operated 50  distribution centers the 34  distribution centers serving carquest stores are significantly smaller at an average of 125000  square feet than our existing advance auto parts distribution centers which average approximately 500000   

 7 

square feet we have recently begun the integration of the advance auto and carquest supply chains in addition to optimization work throughout our entire supply chain in 2016 we plan to close one distribution center in sutton ma and open one new worldpac distribution center in the greater dallas tx area we have also announced our plans to open a new distribution center in the greater nashville tn area in 2017 

in 2015 we implemented technology that has furthered our ability to roll out daily replenishment to the stores served by our advance auto parts distribution centers we will continue to expand our daily replenishment capabilities to our other distributions centers while also leveraging our inmarket hub stores to further increase the speed and efficient utilization of our distribution network worldpac will continue to provide crosssourcing to our advance auto parts and carquest stores 

marketing  advertising   our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness consideration and omnichannel traffic by positioning advance auto parts as the leader in parts availability and project support within the aftermarket auto parts category we strive to exceed our customers expectations end to end through a comprehensive online experience extensive parts assortment speed at the parts counter and our diy customer loyalty program speed perks

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our commercial and diy sales 

team members 

as of february 26 2016  we employed approximately 40000  fulltime team members and approximately 33000  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 86  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 10  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices as of february 26 2016  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions we have never experienced any labor disruption we believe that our team member relations are solid

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including advance auto parts” “autopart international” “carquest “carquest technical institute” “driverside” “motologic” “motoshop” “worldpac” “speeddial” and “technet professional auto service” for use in connection with the automotive parts business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the commercial and diy markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa oreilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe  jack and auto plus formerly uniselect usa inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more desirable store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete 

in addition our reputation is critical to our continued success if we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 

these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to 

 10 

address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

we may not be able to successfully integrate gpi ’ s operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant integration costs and our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing 

integration issues and business expectations 

we cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpi’s operations with ours this integration is complex and our failure to integrate quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors 

the acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and team members which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations in particular we could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification period 

additional integration costs 

in connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

level of indebtedness 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our 

 11 

longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales and enhance our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings   

we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2872  stores at the end of our 2005 fiscal  year to 5293  stores as of january 2 2016  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable 

 12 

to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices 

we are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified executives and other team members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other team members as of february 26 2016  we employed approximately 73000  team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified executive and other team members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified executive and other team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there is also a risk that we may experience difficulty in successfully implementing announced leadership changes including a failure to ensure the effective transfer of knowledge necessary for the persons appointed to lead and provide results in their new role potential disruption to our business resulting from the announced changes and the impact of announced leadership changes on our relationships with customers suppliers and business partners 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline the market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the 

 13 

global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers if our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores an increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 

impact on operating costs 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination including the americans with disabilities act payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements discrimination including the americans with disabilities act labor and employment the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws 

 14 

and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier team member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and added costs on an ongoing basis   

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and team members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers team members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware andor viruses team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled social engineering attacks and phishing scams or other acts unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or team members’ data or may otherwise cause damage or interfere with our equipment andor network while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers’ disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage 

 15 

inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions ghg for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new federal or state restrictions on emissions that may be imposed on vehicles could also adversely affect annual miles driven or the demand for the products we sell and lead to changes in automotive technology changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we anticipate changes to the composition of our board of directors and appointment of a chief executive officer in the near term 

consistent with the terms of our agreement with starboard value lp and certain of its affiliates as reported in the current report on form 8k filed by the company on november 13 2015 we anticipate that our board of directors will nominate three new candidates to be elected to serve as independent board members   in the near term we are also in the process of identifying a permanent chief executive officer changes in board composition andor management may affect our corporate governance business models and strategic priorities which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including litigation relating to employment or arising from claims of discrimination as a result of claims by current and former team members or others although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders the damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition future results of operations or cash flow 

our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including but not limited to automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and their material suppliers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits the automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts the plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the pending cases against us and our subsidiaries are in early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and our liability if any could vary widely as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company or its subsidiaries in the future if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows in future periods

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected consolidated financial data” our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the sections entitled “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31st of each year which results in an extra week every several years fiscal 2014 contained 53 weeks our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53week fiscal year in 2014 our next 53week fiscal year is 2020 

unless otherwise noted our financial results have been presented on a gaap basis in limited instances we have presented our financial results on a gaap and nongaap comparable basis which is described further in the section entitled reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

introduction 

we are a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in north america serving both doitforme or commercial and doityourself or diy customers as of january 2 2016  we operated a total of 5171  stores and 122  branches we operated primarily within the united states with additional locations in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our stores operate primarily under trade names advance auto parts autopart international and carquest and our distribution branches operate under the worldpac trade name in addition we served approximately 1300  independentlyowned carquest stores as of january 2 2016  we acquired the carquest and worldpac operations as part of our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 

our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name oem and private label automotive replacement parts accessories batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars vans sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our commercial and diy customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom and wwwworldpaccom our diy customers can elect to pick up merchandise ordered online at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers’ places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online 

prior acquisitions 

on january 2 2014  we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion  gpi formerly a privatelyheld company was a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac names as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233  carquest stores and 103  worldpac branches located in 45  states and canada and served approximately 1400  independentlyowned carquest stores as of the end of 2015 we have converted 170  and consolidated 178  of these stores into advance auto parts locations 

on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwp’s rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2015 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operations 

for additional information on these acquisitions refer to note 3  acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

management overview 

we generated diluted earnings per share or diluted eps of 640  during 2015  compared to 671  for 2014  the decrease in our diluted eps was driven primarily by costs associated with the integration of gpi store closure and consolidation costs and support center restructuring costs in addition the prior year benefited from an additional week of operations due to our 53week fiscal year when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable diluted earnings per share comparable cash eps in 2015 was 782  compared to 759  during 2014 



refer to the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures section for further details of our comparable adjustments 

excluding the impact of the 53 rd  week of 2014 total sales for 2015 increased 04  over 2014 and comparable store sales were flat our sales results decelerated in the second half of the year due to the impact of gpi integration activities and the negative impact of warmer weather late in the year we began 2015 with an aggressive plan to complete a large part of our integration of gpi during 2015 and we completed several parts of the integration including 240 carquest store consolidations and conversions support center consolidations the integration of our field teams and pricing alignment the multitude of changes proved to be more challenging than anticipated and disrupted two key areas of our operations  i customer service levels and ii inventory availability 

in addition to integrating the carquest operations we are also focused on achieving the cost synergies expected from the acquisition and on other cost control initiatives in 2015 we achieved approximately 1100 million of planned acquisition synergies which was 50 million incremental to 2014 in addition we closed 79 underperforming stores during the fourth quarter of 2015 which is expected to drive productivity improvements in the near future during 2016 we plan to drive additional cost reduction and pursue opportunities to increase efficiency across our operations 

2015  highlights 

a highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our 2015  include 

 

refer to the “consolidated results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”  sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively 

 23 

business update   

our overarching focus in 2016 will be on becoming a fieldcentric organization while continuing to achieve our gpi integration milestones with less overall disruption to our stores and customers in addition we have the following three priorities which we believe are critical in the success of our fieldcentric organization and producing favorable financial results over the longterm 

 

 

 

our multiyear gpi integration plan remains underway which is focused on the integration of our advance auto parts and carquest operations during 2015 we completed the support center consolidations that were initiated in 2014 integrated our field teams harmonized pricing and brands and substantially completed product changeovers in addition we completed the first major wave of the carquest store consolidations and conversions that we began in the second half of 2014 during 2016 we will continue executing our integration plans by consolidating or converting an estimated additional 325 to 350 carquest stores in addition we will shift our focus to the deployment of systems necessary to align critical capabilities within supply chain and information technology 

automotive aftermarket industry 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position our industry favorably in 2016 as lower fuel costs a stabilized labor market and increasing disposable income should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven increasing and the number of vehicles 11 years and older continuing to increase 

we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased by 28 in 2015 setting a new alltime high due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices while current industry indicators are favorable longterm demographics are expected to contain growth rates for miles driven as the labor force participation rate remains below prerecession levels due to an increase in the retirementage population in addition younger drivers are not increasing vehicle usage as fast as the older generation is decreasing usage which is expected to pressure growth in the number of miles driven while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic and demographic pressures impacting demand we believe we will continue to see increases in total miles driven which will drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 

 24 

number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age 

we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for the products we sell within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to both routine maintenance requirements and more frequent mechanical failures during 2015 the number of registered vehicles grew 21 to a record 258 million vehicles according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 277 million vehicles by 2018 the average vehicle age which has exceeded 11 years for the past four years also points to favorable growth in the industry while new car registrations during 2015 were almost 60 higher than in the recession low of 2009 the scrappage rate for 2015 was at its lowest rate in 13 years as a result the mix of vehicles is shifting as reflected by a fiveyear compounded annual growth rate of 44 for vehicles over 11 years old compared to a compounded annual growth rate for all vehicles of 07 we believe that the stabilization of the average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longerterm as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts 

  store development 

we serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store and branch development activity for the year ended january 2 2016  including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with commercial delivery programs during 2016  we anticipate adding approximately 65 to 75 new stores and branches and consolidating or converting between 325 to 350 carquest stores 



1 new stores for carquest represents stores acquired during 2015 

2   consolidated stores include ai bwp and carquest stores whose operations were consolidated into existing aap locations as a result of the planned integration of ai bwp and carquest in 2014 we began the multiyear process of consolidating and converting our carquest stores into aap locations in addition we completed the consolidation of our ai stores located in florida into existing aap locations 

3   converted stores include ai bwp and carquest stores that were rebranded as an aap store as a result of the planned integration of ai bwp and carquest 

4   consists of stores acquired with bwp that operate under the carquest trade name 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our store and branch locations to both our commercial and diy customers sales from our ecommerce websites and sales to independentlyowned carquest stores sales are recorded net of discounts and rebates sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store or branch sales starting once a location has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales sales to independentlyowned carquest stores are excluded from our comparable store sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date approximately one year comparable store sales growth for 2014 and 2015 excludes sales from the 53 rd  week of 2014 

 25 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses including depreciation and amortization gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs and mix of commercial and diy sales see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses acquisition and integration related expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expenses store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs depreciation and amortization closed facility expense and impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



2015  compared to 2014 

net sales 

net sales for 2015  were 97370 million  a decline of 1068  million or 11  from net sales in 2014  this decrease was primarily due to the 53 rd  week of 2014 which contributed 1504 million in sales to 2014 excluding the impact of the 53 rd  week net sales for 2015 increased 04 over 2014 while comparable store sales were flat the slight increase in net sales when excluding the 53 rd  week is due to the addition of 121  new stores partially offset by the portion of sales that did not transfer from the consolidation of 111  stores and closure of 89  stores during 2015 

our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by disruptions from integration activities including the alignment of our field structure products and pricing in addition the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our canadian operations reduced comparable store sales for the year by 36  basis points partially offsetting these negative impacts is an estimated 50 bps of positive contribution from the sales transferred to comparable stores from stores consolidated during 2015 our fourth quarter of 2015 was our weakest quarter in terms of comparable store sales with a decline of 25  the 

 26 

unseasonably warm start to winter impacted both our commercial and diy business particularly in batteries and cold weatherrelated hard parts categories such as starters alternators and related products   

gross profit 

gross profit for 2015  was 44228  million or 454  of net sales as compared to 44536  million or 452  of net sales in 2014  an increase of 18  basis points the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lower product acquisition costs inclusive of merchandise synergies as a result of the acquisition of gpi 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2015  were 35970  million or 369  of net sales as compared to 36019  million or 366  of net sales for 2014  an increase of 35  basis points this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in gpi integration costs store closure and consolidation expenses and support center restructuring costs excluding these costs sga decreased 18  basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs and incentive compensation as well as lower delivery costs as fuel prices have declined these benefits were partially offset by expense deleverage as a result of softer sales see  reconciliation of nongaap financial measures  section for further details of our comparable adjustments 

operating income 

operating income for 2015  was 8258  million representing 85  of net sales as compared to 8517  million or 87  of net sales for 2014  a decrease of 17  basis points this decrease was due to a higher sga rate partially offset by an increase in our gross profit rate these changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2015  was 654  million or 07  of net sales as compared to 734  million or 07  of net sales in 2014  the decrease in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2015  was 2795  million as compared to 2876 million for 2014  our effective income tax rate was 371  and 368  for 2015  and 2014  respectively our income tax rates in both 2015  and 2014  reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations 

net income 

net income was 4734  million or 640  per diluted share for 2015  as compared to 4938  million or 671  per diluted share for 2014  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2015  was 49  as compared to 50  for 2014  the decrease in diluted eps was driven primarily by the decrease in net income 

2014  compared to 2013 

net sales 

net sales for 2014  were 98439 million  an increase of 33500 million  or 516  over net sales for 2013  this growth was primarily due to net sales of 30405 million  from the acquired gpi operations 1504 million in sales from the 53 rd  week comparable store sales of 20  and sales from new stores opened during 2014 our comparable store sales increase reflected stronger performance from commercial sales driven by increases in both traffic and average transaction amount partially offset by a decrease in diy sales driven by lower traffic count our overall transaction value increased primarily due to higher priced products sold and a higher mix of commercial sales   

  

  

 27 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2014  was 44536 million  or 452  of net sales as compared to 32521 million  or 501  of net sales in 2013  a decrease of 484  basis points the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the higher mix of commercial sales which has a lower gross margin rate resulting from the acquisition of gpi and increased supply chain costs partially offset by acquisition synergy savings 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2014  were 36019 million  or 366  of net sales as compared to 25918 million  or 399  of net sales for 2013  a decrease of 332  basis points the primary driver of the net de crease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was the result of the acquired gpi business having a lower sga cost structure partially offsetting this decrease were 732 million or 74 basis points of gpi integration expenses 427 million or 43 basis points of amortization of acquired gpi intangible assets and 90 million or 9 basis points of bwp integration expenses

operating income for 2014  was 8517 million  representing 87  of net sales as compared to 6603 million  or 102  of net sales for 2013  a decrease of 152  basis points this decrease was due to a lower gross profit rate partially offset by a lower sga rate these decreases on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2014  was 734 million  or 07  of net sales as compared to 366 million  or 06  of net sales in 2013  the increase in interest expense was due to additional borrowings related to the gpi acquisition 

income taxes 

income tax expense for 2014  was 2876 million  as compared to 2346 million  for 2013  our effective income tax rate was 368  and 375  for 2014  and 2013  respectively our income tax rate in 2014 was lower than the prior year primarily due to certain nondeductible costs related to the gpi acquisition that increased the rate in 2013 our income tax rates in both 2014 and 2013 reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations 

net income 

net income was 4938 million  or 671  per diluted share for 2014  as compared to 3918 million  or 532  per diluted share for 2013  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2014  was 50  as compared to 60  for 2013  the increase in diluted eps was driven primarily by the increase in net income

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe the reporting of financial results on a nongaap basis to remain comparable is important in assessing the overall performance of the business and is therefore useful to investors and prospective investors we believe that the presentation of financial results that exclude the 53 rd  week of operations in 2014 noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangibles and expenses associated with the integration of gpi store consolidation costs and support center restructuring costs provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors which is indicative of our base operations we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



 

 

 29 

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures the payment of income taxes and funding of our gpi integration activities in addition we may use available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends historically we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict the liquidity needs for our domestic operations 

as of january 2 2016  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 908 million  a decrease of 139 million  compared to january 3 2015  this decrease in cash was primarily a result of net payments on credit facilities and purchases of property and equipment partially offset by cash generated from operations additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2015  activity to 2014  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

as of january 2 2016  our outstanding indebtedness was 12138 million  inclusive of our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured notes this is 4231 million  lower when compared to january 3 2015  as a result of net payments on our credit facilities as of january 2 2016  we had borrowings of 800 million  under our term loan and 800 million  under our credit facility additionally we had 1186 million  in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 8014 million  as of january 2 2016  

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and outstanding customer service priorities including supply chain and information technology and gpi integration expenditures we lease approximately 85  of our stores our capital expenditures were 2347  million in 2015  an increase of 63 million  from 2014  

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi in 2016  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2600 million to 2800 million  these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and systems we anticipate opening between 65 to 75 stores and branches during 2016  

stock repurchases 

we have a stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec as of january 2 2016  we had 

 30 

 4151 million  remaining under our 500 million  stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on may 14 2012 during 2015  we made no repurchases under the stock repurchase program 

during 2015  we repurchased 42458  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 67 million  or an average price of 15698  per share in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units 

dividend 

since 2006 our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of 006  per share to stockholders of record on february 9 2016  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006  per share to be paid on april 1 2016  to all common stockholders of record as of march 18 2016  

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for 2015  2014  and 2013  is reflected in the table and following discussion 



operating activities 

for 2015  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 193 million  to 6896 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by lower net income the timing of income tax deductions and an increase in cash outflows from inventory purchases net of accounts payable our inventory balance as of january 2 2016  increased 2378 million  or 60  over the prior year driven mainly by transitional inventory growth resulting from our product integration and the consolidation of our carquest stores and the opening of new stores and branches these decreases in cash flow were partially offset by increases in cash flow from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of rent and other payments to nonmerchandise vendors 

for 2014  net cash provided by operating activities increased 1637 million to 7090 million  this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both carquest and advance auto parts 

investing activities 

for 2015  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 20349 million  to 2534 million  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of gpi during 2014 

for 2014  net cash used in investing activities increased by 19261 million to 22882 million  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of gpi 

financing activities 

for 2015  net cash used in financing activities increased by 10219 million  to 4460 million  this increase was primarily a result of net payments on the revolving credit facility and term loan 

 31 

for 2014  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2447 million to 5759 million  this increase was primarily a result of net borrowings associated with the acquisition of gpi partially offset by the issuance of unsecured notes in the prior year and a decrease in repurchases of common stock in 2014 

 32 

longterm debt 

bank debt 

on december 5 2013 we entered into a new credit agreement the 2013 credit agreement which provides a 7000 million  unsecured term loan and a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility with advance stores company inc advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the new revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed 2500 million  by those respective lenders up to a total commitment of 125 billion  during the term of the 2013 credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 credit agreement under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the revolving credit facility terminates in december 2018 and the term loan matures in january 2019 

as of january 2 2016  under the 2013 credit agreement we had outstanding borrowings of 800 million  under the revolver and 800 million  under the term loan as of january 2 2016  we also had letters of credit outstanding of 1186 million  which reduced the availability under the revolver to 8014 million  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 110  and 010  per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility fee rate is 015  per annum under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on our credit rating 

the interest rate on the term loan is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 125  and 025  per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively under the terms of the term loan the interest rate is subject to change based on our credit rating

senior unsecured notes 

we issued 450  senior unsecured notes in december 2013 at 9969  of the principal amount of 450 million  which are due december 1 2023 the “2023 notes” the 2023 notes bear interest at a rate of 450  per year payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year we previously issued 450  senior unsecured notes in january 2012 at 99968  of the principal amount of 300 million  which are due january 15 2022 the “2022 notes” the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year we also previously issued 575  senior unsecured notes in april 2010 at 99587  of the principal amount of 300 million  which are due may 1 2020 the “2020 notes” or collectively with the 2023 notes and the 2022 notes “the notes” the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year advance served as the issuer of the notes with certain of advances domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture as amended supplemented waived or otherwise modified the “indenture” among us the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as trustee 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture for the notes we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid 

 33 

interest to the repurchase date the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture i upon the release of the guarantee of our other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt ii upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor or iii upon our exercise of our legal or covenant defeasance option 

the indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for i failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable ii failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the indenture or the notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice iii a default under any debt for money borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity in an aggregate amount greater than 250 million without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by us of notice of the default by the trustee or holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding and iv events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization affecting us and certain of our subsidiaries in the case of an event of default the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated the indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

as of january 2 2016  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa2 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

offbalancesheet arrangements   

we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 297 million  as of january 2 2016  these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of january 2 2016  we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of january 2 2016  were as follows

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 2 2016  our goodwill balance was allocated to six reporting units effective in the first quarter of 2015 we realigned our operating segments resulting in a reevaluation of our reporting units goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 

our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of the carquest and worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

we complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates 

the carrying value of goodwill was 9895 million  and 9954 million  at january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  respectively the carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets was 3347 million  and 3394 million  at january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  respectively the decrease to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in 2015 was due to changes in 

 35 

foreign currency exchange rates for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit or asset group exceeded the carrying values of the respective goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset and therefore no impairment existed we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

income tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 2 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 28 million  for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016  

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 704 million  494 million  and 375 million  respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the increase in our inventory reserves in 2015 was primarily due to estimated shrink on a higher volume of product returns associated with our product changeovers and conversions and increases to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve on imported product 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 

our shrink rate has not fluctuated significantly over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will 

 36 

result in retail prices below recorded costs we are also in the process of integrating gpi and we expect the integration to continue for multiple years final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans which might impact our estimated reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 2 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 44 million  for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016  

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 1340 million  1370 million  and 985 million  respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three years 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 2 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 84 million  for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016  

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 2107 million  and 1798 million  as of january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 2 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 133 million  for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016  

 37 

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 2 2016  would have affected net income by approximately 28 million  for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate risk 

our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of january 2 2016  

the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 2 2016  we had 800 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and 800 million  outstanding under our term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575  450  and 450  respectively per annum 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan outstanding at january 2 2016  by expected maturity dates weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 2 2016  implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 



credit risk 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses 

 38 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our primary foreign currency exposure arises from our canadian operations and the translation of canadian dollar denominated revenues profits and net assets into us dollars during 2015 the translation of the operating results of our canadian subsidiaries did not significantly impact net income we view our investments in the canadian subsidiaries as longterm and any changes in our net assets in the canadian subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the canadian subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

in addition we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of the companys inventory purchases which are denominated in foreign currencies and for intercompany balances we believe that the price volatility of these inventory purchases as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices losses from foreign currency transactions which are included in other income net were 74 million  during 2015

store development 

our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores and branches within existing markets where we can achieve a larger presence remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets the addition of new locations along with strategic acquisitions has played a significant role in our growth and success we believe the opening of new stores and their strategic location in relation to our commercial and diy customers will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 

we open and operate stores in both large denselypopulated markets and small less denselypopulated areas we complete substantial research prior to entering a new market key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics traffic count vehicle profile number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate

our 5372  stores and branches were located in the following states territories and international locations as of january 3 2015  



the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our stores and branches during the past five years

store technology 

each of our store names utilizes a unique store operating system comprised of an integrated pos and epc which enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year make model and engine type of their vehicles in conjunction with our integration of the advance auto parts and carquest stores we plan to eventually utilize one pos system and epc in the longerterm and leverage the benefits of each system 

currently information maintained by our advance auto parts store operating system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly it also provides realtime inventory tracking at the store level allowing store team members to check the quantity of onhand inventory for any sku adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our advance auto parts stores the store system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our hub network can be crosssourced enterprise wide or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time 

the worldpac speeddial ®  parts catalog and fulfillment ordering system provides expanded capabilities to worldpacs commercial customers and other stores throughout our enterprise this tool allows customers to check realtime parts availability on over 100000 parts view images on over 90000 parts check prices place orders view invoices and selfservice returns 

store support centers 

we are headquartered in roanoke va and serve our advance auto parts and carquest stores primarily from our store support centers in roanoke va and raleigh nc we also maintain a store support center in newark ca to support our worldpac and ecommerce operations and in norton ma to support our autopart international stores 

merchandising   in 2014  we purchased merchandise from over 500  vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 6  of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

our merchandising teams have developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers since our acquisition of gpi we have rolled out crosssourcing capabilities to the majority of our stores and more recently we have begun integrating our product offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores some of our brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  denso ®  gates ®  moog ®  monroe ®  ngk ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  autopart international ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ® as well as the carquest ® brand acquired from gpi 

supply chain    our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers hubs stores and branches which enable us to provide sameday or nextday availability to our customers our inventory management teams utilize replenishment systems to monitor inventory levels across the network and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment systems utilize the most uptodate information from our pos systems as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand these factors are combined with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 

the acquisition of gpi significantly increased the number of distribution centers that we operate as of january 3 2015  we operated fifty  distribution centers compared to twelve distribution centers as of december 28 2013 the thirtyfour  distribution centers serving carquest stores are significantly smaller at an average of 125000  square feet than our existing advance auto parts distribution centers which average approximately 500000  square feet one of our integration priorities in 

 7 

2015 is to begin aligning the product offering in our advance auto parts and carquest distribution centers and to eventually connect their respective systems so we can operate as one integrated supply chain worldpac will continue to operate four  distribution centers to service its branches and provide crosssourcing to our advance auto parts and carquest stores 

in addition to the distribution centers acquired with gpi we also opened our newest distribution center in hartford ct in late 2014 this facility incorporates our more advanced warehouse management system similar to the system utilized by our remington in facility which opened in 2012 this technology has furthered our ability to roll out daily replenishment to the stores served by these facilities our supply chain initiatives to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity including planning for the rollout of the advanced technology used at the hartford and remington facilities to other facilities in our supply chain network will now get incorporated into our overall integration plan

motoshop   is a technology solution portfolio consisting of a suite of electronic tools that supports our commercial customers with i online marketing solutions ii fully searchable diagnostic and repair service resources iii online shop tech training and iv a shop management system 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our commercial and diy sales 

team members 

as of february 26 2015  we employed approximately 41600  fulltime team members and approximately 31400  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 87  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 9  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices as of february 26 2015  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions we have never experienced any labor disruption we believe that our team member relations are solid 

 8 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including advance auto parts” “autopart international” “carquest “carquest technical institute” “driverside” “motologic” “motoshop” “worldpac” “service is our best part” “speeddial” and “technet professional auto service” for use in connection with the automotive parts business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the commercial and diy markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc napa oreilly automotive inc the pep boysmanny moe  jack and uniselect inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

 9 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the commercial and diy categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesaler distributors iv jobber stores v independentlyowned stores vi automobile dealers that supply parts and vii internetbased retailers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more lucrative store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties 

these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

 10 

we may not be able to successfully integrate gpi ’ s operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant transaction and integration costs our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and we may not be able to retain key gpi personnel 

integration issues and business expectations 

we cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpi’s operations with ours this integration may be complex and failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors 

the acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding gpi’s and our businesses including affecting gpi’s and our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on gpi’s and our businesses financial results and operations in particular gpi and advance could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification or extend beyond the indemnification period 

additional transaction and integration costs 

in connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant onetime transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

level of indebtedness 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

in addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

 11 

retention of key gpi personnel 

the success of the integration with gpi will depend in part on the ability to retain key gpi employees who are expected to continue employment with the combined company if any of these employees decide not to remain with the combined company it is possible we may be unable to locate suitable replacements for such key employees or to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms in addition if key employees terminate their employment management’s attention might be diverted from successfully integrating gpi’s operations to hiring suitable replacements and the combined companys business might suffer 

  

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency is not successful which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings   

we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2652  stores at the end of our 2004 fiscal  year to 5372  stores as of january 3 2015  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified team members 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

 12 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members as of february 26 2015  we employed 73000  team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package in addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions if these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs if we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

 13 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at relatively high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate payroll taxes increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 and many consumers are now facing increased healthcare costs as a result of the recently enacted affordable care act this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and elective maintenance needed to be completed 

impact on operating costs 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

 14 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and added costs on an ongoing basis   

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber attack team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement or other acts unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or our customers’ data while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers’ disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions ghg for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows new federal or state restrictions on emissions that may be imposed on vehicles could also adversely affect 

 15 

annual miles driven or the demand for the products we sell and lead to changes in automotive technology changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including litigation arising from claims of employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by current and former team members although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders the damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition future results of operations or cash flow 

our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including but not limited to automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and their material suppliers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits the automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts the plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants many of the pending cases against us and our subsidiaries are in early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those entities although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and our liability if any could vary widely as a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company or its subsidiaries in the future if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims

introduction 

we are the largest automotive aftermarket parts provider in north america serving both doitforme or commercial and doityourself or diy customers as of january 3 2015  we operated a total of 5261  stores and 111  distribution branches we operated primarily within the united states with additional locations in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our stores operate primarily under trade names advance auto parts autopart international and carquest and our distribution branches operate under the worldpac trade name in addition we served approximately 1325  independentlyowned carquest stores as of january 3 2015  we acquired the carquest and worldpac operations as part of our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 

our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name oem and private label automotive replacement parts accessories batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars vans sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our commercial and diy customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom wwwcarquestcom and wwwworldpaccom our diy customers can elect to pick up merchandise ordered online at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers’ places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers our commercial customers can also conveniently place their orders online 

management overview 

we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 671  during 2014  compared to 532  for 2013  the increase in our diluted eps was driven primarily by the acquired gpi operations a 20  increase in comparable store sales and an additional week of operations in 2014 when adjusted for the following comparable adjustments our comparable earnings per diluted share comparable cash eps was 759 

• 061 of gpi integration expenses 

• 036 of amortization related to the acquired intangible assets from gpi 

• 008 of bwp integration expenses and 

• 017 from the 53 rd  week partially offsetting the above expenses 

when including the results of the 53 rd  week our comparable cash eps was 776 our diluted eps for 2013 included 027 of transaction expenses related to our acquisition of gpi and 008 of expenses associated with our integration of bwp 

during 2014 we generated a comparable store sales increase of 20  this increase was driven by consistent strength in commercial sales throughout the year with increases in both customer traffic and average ticket for the year we are beginning to realize the benefits from the investments we have made to better serve our commercial customers including but not limited to additional availability of inventory from one of our 421  hub stores daily replenishment in certain markets and rollout of crosssourcing of inventory throughout a majority of our enterprise integration of eservice offerings in our advance auto parts and carquest stores and increased focus on national and regional accounts our diy sales were not as consistent as 

 22 

commercial in 2014 sales of seasonal and maintenance parts categories fluctuated more than anticipated in many of our markets due to the cooler summer and warmer start to the winter selling season 

acquisitions 

on january 2 2014  we acquired gpi in an allcash transaction for 208 billion  gpi formerly a privatelyheld company is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1233  carquest stores and 103  worldpac branches located in 45  states and canada and served approximately 1400  independentlyowned carquest stores we believe the acquisition of gpi will allow us to expand our geographic presence commercial capabilities and overall scale to better serve customers for additional information on the gpi acquisition refer to note 4  acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwp’s rights to distribute to 92 independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi the integration of bwp stores consisted of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations as of the end of 2014 most of the bwp stores have been integrated into the advance auto parts operations

refer to the “consolidated results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”  sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively 

business update   

we have two essential priorities  i deliver results by executing under our key strategies of superior availability and service leadership and ii successfully achieve the goals of the multiyear gpi integration plan our key strategies remain consistent with 2014 superior availability is aimed at product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution of customerfacing initiatives to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our customers in our stores and online through these two key strategies and the integration of gpi we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below to produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the largest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 570  in 2014  compared to 404  in 2013  this increase is primarily due to the contribution of the acquired gpi and bwp operations which are significantly more heavily weighted in commercial than our advance auto parts stores in addition our comparable store sales growth has been driven primarily by sales to commercial customers 

 23 

our strategic priorities include 

 

we are pleased with the first year results of our multiyear gpi integration plan our plan is to fully integrate the carquest owned stores and overall operations into advance auto parts over the next few years and to integrate the availability of all of our product offerings throughout the entire chain we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies 

during 2014 our focus was on team member retention achievement of initial cost savings and synergies improvement of inventory availability including the rollout of crosssourcing with worldpac and carquest and leveraging our differentiated customer programs during 2015 our priorities in the integration plan will include 

 

automotive aftermarket industry 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition we believe the macroeconomic environment should position the industry favorably in 2015 as a steadily improving job market along with lower fuel costs should help to provide a positive impact in addition industry fundamentals continue to be strong with miles driven showing improvement as a result we expect to see a decrease in deferred maintenance over time 

we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items according to the latest statistics available the total number of vehicle miles traveled on us roads increased slightly by 14 in 2014 which was a significant improvement from the 01 increase in 2013 due to improved economic conditions and the drop in gasoline prices industry data suggests that the increase in miles driven will likely remain under prerecession levels due to pressure from a lower labor force participation rate and less vehicle usage by the most recent generation of drivers while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic pressures on our consumers we believe the return of increases in miles driven will continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 

number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age 

we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry as vehicles age and go outofwarranty they generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures since the recession low of 248 million vehicles in 2011 the number of vehicles on the road has increased over the last three years according to industry analysts the number of vehicles on the road is expected to continue to climb and will reach 261 million vehicles by 2017 the overall mix of vehicles on the road is beginning to shift as a result of the increased rate of new car sales the percentage of vehicles that are 6 to 11 years old is 

 24 

expected to decline and the percentage of vehicles that are new to five years old is expected to increase this will slow the growth of average vehicle age which increased from 103 years in 2009 to 114 years in 2013 however we believe that the stabilization of average age of vehicles will continue to benefit our industry in the near term and the overall increase in the total number of vehicles on the road is positive for the longer term as these vehicles age outside of their manufacturer warranty period and require more expensive maintenance and repairs due to the increase in complexity of automobile parts 

  store development 

we serve our commercial and diy customers in a similar fashion through four different store brands the table below sets forth detail of our store development activity for the year ended january 3 2015  including the consolidation of stores as part of our integration plans and the number of locations with commercial delivery programs during 2015  we anticipate adding approximately 100 to 120 new stores and branches 



1   we acquired 1233 carquest stores and 103 worldpac branches as a result of the acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 

2 consolidated stores include bwp and carquest stores whose operations were consolidated into existing aap locations as a result of the planned integration of bwp and carquest in 2014  we began the multiyear process of consolidating and converting our carquest stores into aap locations in addition we began the consolidation of our 33 ai stores located in florida into existing aap locations which is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 

  3  converted stores include bwp and carquest stores that were rebranded as an aap store as a result of the planned integration of bwp and carquest 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our store and branch locations to both our commercial and diy customers sales from our ecommerce websites and sales to independentlyowned carquest stores sales are recorded net of discounts and rebates sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date approximately one year comparable store sales growth for 2014 excludes sales from the 53rd week sales to independentlyowned carquest stores will be excluded from our comparable store sales 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses including depreciation and amortization gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume 

 25 

requirements when we believe it is advantageous our cost of sales and gross profit rates may not be comparable to that of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs and mix of commercial and diy sales see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses acquisition and integration related expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expenses store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs depreciation and amortization closed store expense and impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 



2014  compared to 2013 

net sales 

net sales for 2014  were 98439 million  an increase of 33500  million or 516  over net sales for 2013  this growth was primarily due to sales of 30405 million  from the acquired gpi operations 1504 million in sales from the 53 rd  week comparable store sales of 20  and sales from new stores opened during 2014 our comparable store sales increase reflected stronger performance from commercial driven by increases in both traffic and average transaction amount partially offset by a decrease in diy sales driven by lower traffic count our overall transaction value increased primarily due to higher priced products sold and a higher mix of commercial sales   



  

gross profit 

gross profit for 2014  was 44536  million or 452  of net sales as compared to 32521  million or 501  of net sales in 2013  a decrease of 484  basis points the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the higher mix of commercial sales which has a lower gross margin rate resulting from the acquisition of gpi and increased supply chain costs partially offset by acquisition synergy savings 

 26 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2014  were 36019  million or 366  of net sales as compared to 25918  million or 399  of net sales for 2013  a decrease of 332  basis points the primary driver of the net de crease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was the result of the acquired gpi business having a lower sga cost structure partially offsetting this decrease  were 732 million  or 74  basis points of gpi integration expenses 427 million  or 43  basis points of amortization of acquired gpi intangible assets and 90 million  or 9  basis points of bwp integration expenses 

operating income 

operating income for 2014  was 8517  million representing 87  of net sales as compared to 6603  million or 102  of net sales for 2013  a decrease of 152  basis points this decrease was due to a lower gross profit rate partially offset by a lower sga rate these decreases on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and sga drivers previously discussed 

interest expense 

interest expense for 2014  was 734  million or 07  of net sales as compared to 366  million or 06  of net sales in 2013  the increase in interest expense was due to additional borrowings related to the gpi acquisition

net income 

net income was 4938  million or 671  per diluted share for 2014  as compared to 3918  million or 532  per diluted share for 2013  as a percentage of net sales net income for 2014  was 50  as compared to 60  for 2013  the increase in diluted eps was driven primarily by the increase in net income 

2013  compared to 2012 

net sales 

net sales for 2013  were 64938 million  an increase of 2888 million  or 47  over net sales for 2012  this growth was primarily due to sales from the acquired bwp stores and sales from the new aap and ai stores added within 2013  partially offset by a 15  decrease in comparable store sales the comparable store sales decrease was driven by a decrease in transaction count partially offset by an increase in transaction value despite more promotional activity in response to lower customer demand the increase in transaction value was primarily due to i the gradual increase in cost and complexity of automotive parts and commodity prices and ii the positive impact from a higher mix of commercial sales 

  

  

gross profit 

gross profit for 2013  was 32521 million  or 501  of net sales as compared to 30980 million  or 499  of net sales in 2012  an increase of 15  basis points the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by increased merchandise margins due to lower acquisition costs and a favorable product mix and improvement in shrink partially offset by planned inefficiencies in supply chain costs associated with the rampup in shipments of inventory from our new distribution center and the impact from a higher mix of commercial sales which have a lower gross profit rate the increase in our commercial mix of sales was primarily due to the sales from the acquired bwp stores 

 27 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for 2013  were 25918 million  or 399  of net sales as compared to 24407 million  or 393  of net sales for 2012  an increase of 58  basis points included in sga expenses in 2013  were 250 million or 38 basis points of transaction expenses associated with our acquisition of gpi and 80 million or 12 basis points of expenses associated with our integration of bwp other primary drivers of the net increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales include costs associated with increased new store openings and higher incentive compensation partially offset by lower marketing expense and a decrease in overall administrative and support costs

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe the reporting of financial results on a nongaap basis to remain comparable is important in assessing the overall performance of the business and is therefore useful to investors and prospective investors we believe that the presentation of financial results that exclude the 53 rd  week of operations noncash charges related to the acquired gpi intangibles and expenses associated with the integration of gpi and bwp provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors which is indicative of our base operations we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following table 



 

 

 29 

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our credit agreement to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year cash holdings in our foreign affiliates are not significant relative to our overall operations and therefore would not restrict our liquidity needs for our domestic operations 

as of january 3 2015  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1047 million  a decrease of 10078 million  compared to december 28 2013  this decrease in cash was primarily a result of cash used in the acquisition of gpi partially offset by cash generated from operations and net borrowings under credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of 2014  activity to 2013  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

as of january 3 2015  our outstanding indebtedness was 16369 million  or 5833 million  higher when compared to december 28 2013  as a result of additional borrowings of 4900 million  under our term loan and 934 million  under our credit facility additionally we had 1243 million  in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the available borrowings on our revolver to 7823 million  as of january 3 2015  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies 

gpi acquisition and exit activities 

we borrowed 10060 million  under a term loan and revolving credit facility which we used along with cash onhand to fund the  208 billion  acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the normal operations of gpi we expect to incur 1900 million of gpi integration expenses through the end of 2018 with the majority of the expenses being incurred by the end of 2016 we expect 1600 million of these expenses to be offset during this period by savings from acquisition synergies during 2014 we incurred 732 million  of gpi integration expenses partially offset by 610 million of synergies 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and information technology we lease approximately 85  of our stores our capital expenditures were 2284  million in 2014  an increase of 327 million  from 2013  in addition to routine capital expenditures our capital investments during 2014  included the acquisition of gpi and nine  independent stores for 20608 million  net of cash acquired 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores information technology supply chain network and the integration of gpi 

 30 

in 2015  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 325 million to 340 million  these investments will primarily include gpi integration expenditures for store conversions and supply chain and systems integration activities new store development leased and owned locations and investments in our existing stores supply chain network and systems we anticipate opening between 100 to 120 stores and branches during 2015  

stock repurchases 

we have a stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec as of january 3 2015  we had  4151 million  remaining under our 500 million  stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on may 14 2012 during 2014  we made no repurchases under the stock repurchase program 

during 2014  we repurchased 34682  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 52 million  or an average price of 14885  per share in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units 

dividend 

since 2006 our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of 006  per share to stockholders of record on february 11 2015  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006  per share to be paid on april 3 2015  to all common stockholders of record as of march 20 2015  

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for 2014  2013  and 2012  is reflected in the table and following discussion 



operating activities 

for 2014  net cash provided by operating activities increased 1637 million  to 7090 million  this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and noncash expenses along with an increase in accounts payable this was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accrued expenses and other assets related to the timing of payroll and payments to nonmerchandise vendors the benefit from accounts payable was expected as we were able to integrate terms for certain vendors serving both carquest and advance auto parts 

for 2013  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1400 million to 5453 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a 2063 million increase in inventory net of accounts payable primarily due to an increase in inventory related to new stores and other inventory availability initiatives combined with the deceleration in our accounts payable ratio partially offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a 571 million decrease in the outflow of cash related to receivables resulting from the transition of our inhouse commercial credit program in 2012 and a 224 million increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payments to vendors 

investing activities 

for 2014  net cash used in investing activities increased by 19261 million  to 22882 million  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of gpi 

for 2013  net cash used in investing activities increased by 891 million to 3621 million  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of bwp partially offset by a reduction in investments 

 31 

in property and equipment as a result of less spending on existing stores new store development information technology and investments in supply chain 

financing activities 

for 2014  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2447 million  to 5759 million  this increase was primarily a result of net borrowings associated with the acquisition of gpi partially offset by the issuance of unsecured notes in the prior year and a decrease in repurchases of common stock in 2014 

for 2013  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2033 million to 3312 million  this increase was primarily a result of a net change in borrowings under our senior unsecured notes and credit facilities partially offset by a 537 million increase in the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program

on december 5 2013 we entered into a new credit agreement the 2013 credit agreement which provides a 7000 million  unsecured term loan and a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility with advance stores company inc advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent this revolving credit facility replaced the revolver under our former credit agreement dated as of may 27 2011 with advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “2011 credit agreement” upon execution of the 2013 credit agreement the lenders’ commitments under the 2011 credit agreement were terminated and the liabilities of us and our subsidiaries with respect to obligations under the 2011 credit agreement were discharged the new revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed 2500 million  by those respective lenders up to a total commitment of 125 billion  during the term of the 2013 credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2013 credit agreement under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the revolving credit facility terminates in december 2018 and the term loan matures in january 2019 

as of january 3 2015  under the 2013 credit agreement we had outstanding borrowings of 934 million  under the revolver and 4900 million  under the term loan as of january 3 2015  we also had letters of credit outstanding of 1243 million  which reduced the availability under the revolver to 7823 million  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 130  and 030  per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility fee rate is 020  per annum under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the interest rate and facility fee are subject to change based on our credit rating 

the interest rate on the term loan is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 150  and 050  per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively under the terms of the term loan the interest rate is subject to change based on our credit rating 

the 2013 credit agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of a subsidiaries of advance stores to among other things create incur or assume additional debt b advance stores and its subsidiaries to among other things i incur liens ii make loans and investments iii guarantee obligations and iv change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries c advance advance stores and their subsidiaries to among other things i engage in certain mergers acquisitions asset sales and liquidations ii enter into certain hedging arrangements iii enter into restrictive agreements limiting its ability to incur liens on any of its property or assets pay distributions repay loans or guarantee indebtedness of its subsidiaries and iv engage in saleleaseback transactions and d advance to among other things change its holding company status advance and advance stores are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio the 2013 credit agreement also provides for customary events of default including nonpayment defaults covenant defaults and crossdefaults to advance stores’ other material indebtedness we were in compliance with our covenants with respect to the 2013 credit agreement at january 3 2015

senior unsecured notes 

we issued 450  senior unsecured notes in december 2013 at 9969  of the principal amount of 450 million  which are due december 1 2023 the “2023 notes” the 2023 notes bear interest at a rate of 450  per year payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year the net proceeds from the offering of these notes were approximately 4452 million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the net proceeds from the 2023 notes were used in aggregate with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and cash onhand to fund our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014  

we previously issued 450  senior unsecured notes in january 2012 at 99968  of the principal amount of 300 million  which are due january 15 2022 the “2022 notes” the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year we also previously issued 575  senior unsecured notes in april 2010 at 99587  of the principal amount of 300 million  which are due may 1 2020 the “2020 notes” or collectively with the 2023 notes and the 2022 notes “the notes” the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year advance served as the issuer of the notes with certain of advances domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture as amended supplemented waived or otherwise modified the “indenture” among us the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as trustee 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture for the notes we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture i upon the release of the guarantee of our other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt ii upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor or iii upon our exercise of our legal or covenant defeasance option 

the indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for i failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable ii failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the indenture or the notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice iii a default under any debt for money borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity in an aggregate amount greater than 250 million without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by us of notice of the default by the trustee or holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding and iv events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization affecting us and certain of our subsidiaries in the case of an event of default the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated the indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

as of january 3 2015  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

offbalancesheet arrangements   

we guarantee loans made by banks to various of our independent store customers totaling 336 million  as of january 3 2015  these loans are collateralized by security agreements on merchandise inventory and other assets of the borrowers we believe the likelihood of performance under these guarantees is remote and that the fair value of these guarantees is very minimal as of january 3 2015  we had no other offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

 33 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of january 3 2015  were as follows

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

acquisition impacts 

we acquired gpi on january 2 2014 the process of integrating gpi with aap has begun and we expect the integration to continue for a few years we have used various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including using a market participant perspective when applying certain generally accepted valuation techniques supplemented with market appraisals where appropriate significant judgments and estimates were required in preparing these fair value estimates final decisions about product offerings brand usage store conversions and other elements of the integration plan could be different from current plans accordingly critical accounting policies and estimates such as but not limited to inventory valuationobsolescence asset impairments goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes may have additional acquisitionrelated impacts beyond what is described in the following respective critical accounting policies 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as of january 3 2015  the vast majority of our goodwill balance was allocated to three of our five reporting units our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value exceeds carrying value we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm 

we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units critical assumptions include projected sales growth gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates 

the carrying value of goodwill was 9954 million  and 1998 million  at january 3 2015  and december 28 2013  respectively the increase to goodwill in 2014 was primarily due to our acquisition of gpi and has been allocated between our carquest and worldpac reporting units for the periods presented the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units and therefore no impairment existed the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our recently acquired reporting units may not be indicative of the total company because there have been no significant changes in valuation assumptions since the acquisition date we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

income tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

 35 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 3 2015  would have affected net income by approximately 16 million  for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for 2014  2013  and 2012  were 494 million  375 million  and 314 million  respectively the increase in our inventory reserves in 2014 was primarily reflective of the significant growth in our inventory due to the acquisition of gpi the reported inventory reserves properly exclude any adjustments made to establish the fair value of gpis opening inventory balance 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores and branches over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 

our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 20 basis points over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 3 2015  would have affected net income by approximately 31 million  for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for 2014  2013  and 2012  were 1370 million  985 million  and 945 million  respectively when excluding 417 million of reserves from our acquisition of gpi in 2014 our selfinsurance reserves have remained relatively flat over the last three years due to favorable claims development partially offset by the impact of our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles 

 36 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 3 2015  would have affected net income by approximately 87 million  for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1798 million  and 1113 million  as of january 3 2015  and december 28 2013  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at january 3 2015  would have affected net income by approximately 114 million  for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 3 2015  would have affected net income by approximately 30 million  for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate risk 

our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of january 3 2015  

the interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of january 3 2015  we had 934 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and 4900 million  outstanding under our term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575  450  and 450  respectively per annum 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan outstanding at january 3 2015  by expected maturity dates weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 3 2015  implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates 



credit risk 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our consolidated operations in addition some of the companys inventory purchases are denominated in foreign currencies we believe that the price volatility of these products as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices we have not historically had significant foreign currency exchange gains and losses

store support center 

merchandising    purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations 

 

our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories oil and chemicals our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 

in fiscal 2013  we purchased merchandise from approximately 490  vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 9  of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers some of these brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  moog ®  monroe ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ®  

supply chain    our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers pdq ®  warehouses hubs and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center pdq ®  warehouse hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment system utilizes the most uptodate information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 

we operate nine  aap distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with a warehouse management system or wms which provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the wms integrated with material handling equipment reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “picktolight” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems we opened our newest distribution center in remington indiana in late 2012 it incorporates our more advanced warehouse management system which has enabled us to roll out daily replenishment to many of the stores serviced by remington we have ongoing supply chain initiatives to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity including planning for the rollout of the advanced technology used at the remington facility to other facilities in our supply chain network 

store inventories are replenished from our nine  distribution centers we utilize reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores in addition to a stores normal inventory assortment our stock pdq ®  warehouses  nine  of which are included in our distribution centers offer approximately 93000  skus to support all of our retail stores stores have visibility through our epc system to inventory in their respective pdq ®  warehouses and distribution centers as well as facilities throughout the company and can place orders to these facilities through an online ordering system ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a sameday or nextday basis through our dedicated pdq ®  trucking fleet and thirdparty carriers 

  

marketing  advertising      our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness and store traffic by positioning the advance auto parts brand as the service leader in the aftermarket auto parts category we strive to exceed our customers expectations through our valueadded services extensive parts assortment and quality merchandise 

 7 

the ‘service is our best part ® ’ campaign was developed based on extensive research with our customers and team members it has become the company’s promise which has been embraced by each of our 71867  team members the campaign targets core diy and commercial customers and emphasizes our commitment to provide marketleading service to our customers the campaign is built around a multichannel communications plan which brings together radio outdoor direct marketing and digital media the plan is supported by instore and event signage as well as mobile and social media 

a final component of our marketing plan is event marketing previously advance was the title sponsor of the advance auto parts monster jam a live familyoriented monster truck event tour our sponsorship programs have shifted to local grassroots level events intended to positively impact the individual communities we serve including latino and other ethnic communities and to drive awareness and repeated store visits 

  

ai segment 

ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market with an emphasis on parts for imported cars from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states in addition its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing premium parts expert customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ais product is sold under its own proprietary brand the ai stores offer approximately 30000  skus through routine replenishment from its supply chain with access to over 200000  skus through local sourcing networks 

ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september 2005 as of december 28 2013  we operated 217  stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states 



the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 



seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

as of february 20 2014  we employed 41238  fulltime team members and approximately 30629  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 87  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 9  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices our team member counts reflect the gpi acquisition as of february 20 2014  less than 1 of our team members were represented by labor unions we have never experienced any labor disruption we believe that our team member relations are solid 

 8 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “autopart international” “driverside” “motologic” and “service is our best part” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boysmanny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores more lucrative store locations better store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties 

our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our 

 10 

current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

we may not be able to successfully integrate gpi ’ s operations with ours the gpi business may not achieve the expected business results and could cause us to incur unexpected liabilities the gpi acquisition has caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant transaction and integration costs our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and we may not be able to retain key gpi personnel 

integration issues and business expectations 

we cannot be certain whether and to what extent any strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition of gpi will be achieved in order to obtain the anticipated benefits of the transaction we must integrate gpi’s operations with ours this integration may be complex and failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect our earnings the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if our integration of gpi is unsuccessful takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors or the effect of the acquisition on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors 

the acquisition of gpi could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding gpi’s and our businesses including affecting gpi’s and our relationships with existing and future customers wholesalers independentlyowned and jobber stores suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on gpi’s and our business financial results and operations in particular gpi and advance could lose customers or suppliers and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased or otherwise adversely affected in economic value in addition we have diverted and will continue to divert significant management resources towards the integration efforts which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi we assumed all of the liabilities of gpi including any actual or contingent liabilities to which gpi is or may become subject gpi may be or may become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances and occurrences although the agreement pursuant to which we acquired gpi provides us with certain indemnification provisions potential costs relating to any such liabilities could exceed the amount of any such indemnification 

additional transaction and integration costs 

in connection with the gpi acquisition we have incurred significant onetime transaction costs and entered into new financing agreements and issued new debt instruments we expect to incur additional transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition although efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may allow us to offset incremental transaction and integration costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

level of indebtedness 

in connection with our acquisition of gpi our level of indebtedness increased significantly our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 

 11 

in addition the indenture governing the notes related to the gpi acquisition and the credit agreement governing the new credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes 

retention of key gpi personnel 

the success of the integration with gpi will depend in part on the ability to retain key gpi employees who are expected to continue employment with the combined company if any of these employees decide not to remain with the combined company it is possible we may be unable to locate suitable replacements for such key employees or to secure employment of suitable replacements on reasonable terms in addition if key employees terminate their employment management’s attention might be diverted from successfully integrating gpi’s operations to hiring suitable replacements and the combined companys business might suffer 

  

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings   

we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2539  stores at the end of our 2003 fiscal  year to 4049  stores as of december 28 2013  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified sales associates 

 12 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq ®  warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members as of february 20 2014  we employed 71867  team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members who may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under 

 13 

our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt term loan and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility term loan or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at relatively high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate payroll taxes increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 and many consumers are now facing increased healthcare costs as a result of the recently enacted affordable care act this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 

impact on operating costs 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or others for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters the implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and 

 14 

adversely affect our results of operations if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace   

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber attack team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement or other acts and unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or our customers’ data while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or insurrection involving any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and other types of energy such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers’ disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

 15 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected consolidated financial data” our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under the sections entitled “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31st of each year which results in an extra week every several years the next 53 week fiscal year is 2014 our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks 

introduction 

we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts accessories batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states our stores carry an extensive product line for cars vans sport utility vehicles and light trucks we serve both diy and commercial customers our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver products from our store locations to our commercial customers’ places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers as of december 28 2013  we operated 4049  stores throughout 39  states puerto rico and the virgin islands 

as of december 28 2013  we operated in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern southeastern and midwestern inclusive of south central regions of the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands these stores operate under the trade name “advance auto parts” except for certain stores in the state of florida which operate under the “advance discount auto parts” trade name as of december 28 2013  we operated 3832  stores in the aap segment our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our diy and commercial customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom our online website allows our diy customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to their home or business our commercial customers can conveniently place their orders online 

as of december 28 2013  we operated 217  stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name ai’s business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states 

management overview 

we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 532  during fiscal 2013  compared to 522  for fiscal 2012  negatively impacting our diluted eps in fiscal 2013 were 270 million of transaction related expenses related to our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and 80 million of expenses associated with our integration of bwp excluding these impacts our operating income accelerated in the second half of our fiscal year primarily due to improving sales and more disciplined cost control throughout much of fiscal 2013 our sales remained constrained in many of our markets in part due to the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and increased competition in our operating area we believe consumer spending was suppressed as consumers faced higher payroll taxes the uncertainty regarding the federal government shutdown and the apprehension regarding the impact of health care reform we believe that our core consumers are performing only the repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road which has resulted in a significant level of deferred maintenance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  our sales accelerated particularly in some of our colder weather markets driven by the extraordinary cold weather which has increased the demand for failure and maintenance parts we continue to generate a significant amount of cash onhand to invest in capital improvements and initiatives to support our key strategies superior availability and service leadership which are discussed later in the “business update”

fiscal 2013  highlights 

a highlevel summary of our financial results and other highlights from our fiscal 2013  include

other 

 

subsequent to fiscal 2013 we completed the acquisition of   gpi    a leading privatelyheld distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket automotive replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands 

refer to the “results of operations” and “liquidity”  sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results respectively 

business update   

our two key strategies are superior availability and service leadership superior availability is aimed at product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution of customerfacing initiatives to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our diy and commercial customers in our stores and online through these two key strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the biggest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 404  in fiscal 2013  compared to 381  in fiscal 2012  this increase has been more pronounced in fiscal 2013 due to the contribution of the acquired bwp stores which are more weighted in commercial sales than our advance stores 

our strategic priorities include 

 

acquisitions 

on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc a privatelyheld company that supplied marketed and distributed automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers prior to the acquisition bwp 

 24 

operated or supplied 216 locations in the northeastern united states concurrent with the closing of the acquisition we transferred one distribution center and bwp’s rights to distribute to 92  independently owned locations to an affiliate of gpi we believe this acquisition will enable us to continue our expansion in the competitive northeast which is a strategic growth area for us due to the large population and overall size of the market and to gain valuable information to apply to our existing operations as a result of bwp’s expertise in commercial during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we began integrating the 124  bwp companyowned stores and two distribution centers into our advance auto parts operations and plan to finish the integration by mid2014 the integration of bwp stores consists of converting or consolidating those locations into advance auto parts locations 

after the 2013 fiscal year we acquired general parts international inc on january 2 2014  for a purchase price of  208 billion  gpi formerly a privately held company is a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and automotive aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the carquest and worldpac brands as of the acquisition date gpi operated 1248  carquest stores and 105  worldpac branches located in 45  states and canada and serviced approximately 1400  independentlyowned carquest stores we believe the acquisition of gpi will allow us to expand our geographic presence commercial capabilities and overall scale to better serve customers for additional information on the gpi acquisition refer to note 23  subsequent event in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules of this annual report on form 10k 

  

automotive aftermarket industry 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continues to impact us and the retail industry in general while we believe that the current macroeconomic environment continues to constrain consumer spending we remain confident that the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry are positive furthermore we continue to believe we are well positioned to serve our customers by meeting their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items while miles driven in the us remained relatively flat during 2012 miles driven began to increase beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2013 and continuing through the end of the year historically rapid increases in fuel prices have negatively impacted total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel in 2012 and 2013 gas prices were relatively flat and have become somewhat less volatile when compared to prior years another factor impacting miles driven is the average daily commute which corresponds to the unemployment rate as the unemployment rate improves as it has over the past two years the number of employees commuting increases and in turn the number of miles driven increases while we believe there are ongoing macroeconomic pressures on our consumers the return of increases in miles driven and stabilization in gasoline prices and improvements in the unemployment rate will continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 

number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age 

we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry there were 248 million vehicles on the road in 2013 which is 6 higher than in 2003 while recent industry data reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” indicates that the growth in number of vehicles on the road has decelerated and new vehicle registrations are increasing the average age of vehicle continues to increase the average age of vehicles has gradually increased over the last five years from 103 years in 2009 to 113 years in 2013 we believe that the average age of vehicles continues to increase due to relatively constant scrappage rates a rate of new car sales well under the 10year trend and an increase in overall quality of vehicles as the average age of a vehicle increases a larger percentage of the miles driven are outside of the manufacturer warranty period these outofwarranty older vehicles generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures we believe that despite an improving economy consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer contributing to the trend of an aging vehicle population

  store development by segment 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  by segment we lease 79  of our aap stores we lease 100  of our ai stores all of our ai stores have commercial delivery programs 

  

  

the number of aap and ai store closures includes the previously planned consolidations of 20 bwp stores and 13 ai stores respectively subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2013 we added 1248 carquest stores and 105 worldpac branches as a result of the gpi acquisition during fiscal 2014  we anticipate opening 120 to 140 aap and ai stores and worldpac branches we have not yet finalized the allocation of openings between aap ai and worldpac 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our ecommerce website our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening acquired stores are included in our comparable store sales once the stores have completed 13 complete accounting periods following the acquisition date approximately one year 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume commitments when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses acquisition and integration related expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expenses store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs closed store expense impairment charges and acquisitionrelated and integration costs if any and other related expenses see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs

aap segment sales were 61713 million  an increase of 2564 million  or 43  over fiscal 2012  this growth was primarily a result of sales from the acquired bwp stores and sales from the net addition of 152  new stores opened during fiscal 2013 partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 17  the comparable store sales decrease was driven by a decrease in transaction count partially offset by an increase in transaction value which is reflective of higher priced products sold and a higher mix of commercial sales ai segment sales were 3372 million  an increase of 311 million  or 102  over fiscal 2012

aap segment sales were 59149 million  an increase of 300 million  or 05  over fiscal 2011  this growth was primarily a result of sales from the net addition of 116  new stores over fiscal 2012 partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 09  the comparable store sales decrease was driven by a decrease in transaction count partially offset by an increase in transaction value despite more promotional activity in response to lower customer demand the increase in transaction value is primarily due to i the gradual increase in cost and complexity of automotive parts and commodity prices 

 28 

and ii the positive impact from a higher mix of commercial sales ai segment sales were 3061 million  an increase of 51 million  or 17  over fiscal 2011

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing under our new credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year including our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 and its ongoing operation 

as of december 28 2013  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 11125 million  an increase of 5144 million  compared to december 29 2012  the end of fiscal 2012  this increase in cash was primarily a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of senior unsecured notes partially offset by investments in property and equipment and cash used in the acquisition of bwp additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of fiscal 2013  activity to fiscal 2012  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

as of december 28 2013  our outstanding indebtedness was 10536 million  or 4485 million  higher when compared to december 29 2012  as a result of additional borrowings of 4486 million  under our senior unsecured notes issued on december 3 2013 additionally we had 873 million  in letters of credit outstanding the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies our debt availability as of december 28 2013  was 5454 million  based on the maximum amount of additional borrowings allowed under our leverage ratio subsequent to december 28 2013  our debt availability was updated in accordance with our new credit facility to reflect the additional borrowings related to the gpi acquisition 

gpi acquisition 

subsequent to december 28 2013  we borrowed 10060 million  which we used along with cash onhand to fund the  208 billion  acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to the normal operations of gpi we will incur a significant amount of integration costs over the next three years in conjunction with the integration of gpi 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development leased and owned locations maintenance of existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and information technology our capital expenditures were 1958 million  in fiscal 2013  a decrease of 754 million  from fiscal 2012  in addition to routine capital expenditures our capital investments during fiscal 2013  included the acquisition of bwp for 1861 million 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing of new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in our existing stores information technology and our supply chain network in fiscal 

 30 

2014  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 325 million  350 million  these investments will be primarily driven by new store development leased and owned locations investments in our existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including continued investments in our supply chain network and new systems we anticipate opening between 120 to 140 aap stores and ai stores and worldpac branches during fiscal 2014  we have not yet finalized the allocation of openings between aap ai and worldpac 

stock repurchase program

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  is reflected in the table and following discussion 



operating activities 

for fiscal 2013  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1400 million  to 5453 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a 2063 million increase in inventory net of accounts payable primarily due to an increase in inventory related to new stores and other inventory availability initiatives combined with the deceleration in our accounts payable ratio partially offsetting these decreases in operating cash flow was a 571 million decrease in the outflow of cash related to receivables resulting from the transition of our inhouse commercial credit program last year and a 224 million increase in accrued expenses related to the timing of payments to vendors 

for fiscal 2012  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1436 million to 6853 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to

partially offsetting the decrease in operating cash flow was 

 

investing activities 

for fiscal 2013  net cash used in investing activities increased by 891 million  to 3621 million  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash used in the acquisition of bwp partially offset by a reduction in investments in property and equipment as a result of less spending on existing stores new store development information technology and investments in supply chain 

for fiscal 2012  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 170 million to 2730 million  the decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for business acquisitions 

financing activities 

for fiscal 2013  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2033 million  to 3312 million  this increase was primarily a result of a net change in borrowings under our senior unsecured notes and credit facilities partially offset by a 537 million increase in the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 

for fiscal 2012  net cash used in financing activities increased by 6681 million to 1279 million  this increase was primarily a result of 

 

partially offsetting these increases was a 2300 million decrease in net borrowings on credit facilities 

longterm debt 

bank debt 

on december 5 2013 we entered into a new credit agreement which provides a 7000 million  unsecured term loan and a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the “2013 credit agreement” with advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent this new revolving credit facility replaced the revolver under our former credit agreement dated as of may 27 2011 with advance stores as borrower the lenders party thereto jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “2011 credit agreement” upon execution of the 2013 credit agreement the lenders’ commitments under the 2011 credit agreement were terminated and the liabilities of us and our subsidiaries with respect to their obligations under the 2011 credit agreement were discharged the new revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not to exceed 2500 million  up to a total commitment of 125 billion  during the term of the credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility terminates in december 2018 and the term loan matures in january 2019 

as of december 28 2013  we had not borrowed any amounts under the 2013 credit agreement but subsequently borrowed 7000 million  under the term loan and 3060 million  under the revolver in conjunction with our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014 as of december 28 2013  we had letters of credit outstanding of 873 million  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies our debt availability as of december 28 2013  was 5454 million  based on the maximum amount of additional borrowings allowed under our leverage ratio 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 130  and 030  per annum for the adjusted libor and 

 32 

alternate base rate borrowings respectively a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility fee rate is 020  per annum and subject to change based on our credit ratings under the terms of the 2013 credit agreement the interest rate and facility fee are based on our credit rating

senior unsecured notes 

w e issued 450  senior unsecured notes on december 3 2013 at 9969  of the principal amount of 450 million  which are due december 1 2023 the “2023 notes” the 2023 notes bear interest at a rate of 450  per year payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning june 1 2014 the net proceeds from the offering of these notes were approximately 4452 million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the net proceeds from the 2023 notes were used in aggregate with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan and cash onhand to fund our acquisition of gpi on january 2 2014  

we previously issued its 450  senior unsecured notes in january 2012 at 99968  of the principal amount of 300 million  and are due january 15 2022 the “2022 notes” the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year our 575  senior unsecured notes were issued in april 2010 at 99587  of the principal amount of 300 million  and are due may 1 2020 the “2020 notes” or collectively with the 2023 notes and the 2022 notes “the notes” the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year advance served as the issuer of the notes with certain of advance’s domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture as amended supplemented waived or otherwise modified the “indenture” among us the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and wells fargo bank national association as trustee 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in each of the indentures for the notes we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors party thereto we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture i upon the release of the guarantee of our other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt ii upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor or iii upon our exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option 

the indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for i failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable ii failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the indenture or the notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice iii a default under any debt for money borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity in an aggregate amount greater than 250 million without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by us of notice of the default by the trustee or holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding and iv events of bankruptcy insolvency or 

 33 

reorganization affecting us and certain of our subsidiaries in the case of an event of default the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated the indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

as of december 28 2013  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

offbalancesheet arrangements   

as of december 28 2013  we had no offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations as of december 28 2013  were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 7 longterm debt  note 15 income taxes  note 16 lease commitments  note 17 contingencies  and note 18 benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules of this annual report on form 10k    

 

 34 

not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table 

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

 cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1113 million  and 1030 million  as of december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 28 2013  would have affected net income by approximately 70 million  for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were 375 million  314 million  and 308 million  respectively 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 

our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 10 basis points over the last two years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 

 35 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs in fiscal 2013 the increase in our inventory reserves was driven primarily by our continued rampup in the sale of imported products and the lack of return privileges with those vendors 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 28 2013  would have affected net income by approximately 23 million  for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 28 2013  would have affected net income by approximately 25 million  for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were 985 million  945 million  and 989 million  respectively historically our total selfinsurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles partially offset by favorable claims development in the last two years when excluding 42 million of reserves from our acquisition of bwp in fiscal 2013 our selfinsurance reserves were essentially flat with the prior year 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle we classify the portion of our selfinsurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in longterm liabilities 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 28 2013  would have affected net income by approximately 62 million  for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm 

 36 

we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth we have allocated our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within each of our reportable segments to multiple reporting units in our aap segment and to the entire ai segment respectively 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test for the presented periods the impairment assessments indicated that the fair values of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

income tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 28 2013  would have affected net income by approximately 18 million  for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate risk 

our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges we had no derivative instruments outstanding as of december 28 2013  

the interest rate on borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and term loan is based at the company’s option on adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 28 2013  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or term loan subsequent to december 28 2013  we borrowed on the revolving 

 37 

credit facility and term loan and are therefore exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 2022 or 2023 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 450 and 450 respectively per annum 

credit risk 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses

store support center 

merchandising    purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations 

 

our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories oil and chemicals our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 

in fiscal 2012  we purchased merchandise from approximately 450  vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 9  of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers some of these brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  federalmogul moog ®  or moog ®  monroe ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ®  

supply chain    our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers pdq ®  warehouses hubs and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center pdq ®  warehouse hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment system utilizes the most uptodate information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 

during 2012 we opened our remington in distribution center this distribution center will provide needed capacity to support our growth and product availability initiatives it incorporates our new warehouse management system or wms and state of the art order processing technology which in addition to the features below will allow us to provide daily replenishment to many of the stores served by remington including the remington facility we operate nine  aap distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with a wms which provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the wms integrated with material handling equipment reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “picktolight” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems we have ongoing supply chain initiatives to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity including planning for the rollout of the advanced technology used at the remington facility to other facilities in our supply chain network 

store inventories are replenished from our nine  distribution centers we utilize reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores in addition to a stores normal inventory assortment we currently offer approximately 83000  skus to support all of our retail stores via our 22  standalone pdq ®  warehouses andor our nine  distribution centers all of which stock pdq ®  items stores have visibility through our epc system to inventory in their respective pdq ®  warehouses and distribution centers as well as facilities throughout the company and can place orders to these facilities through an online ordering system ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a sameday or nextday basis through our dedicated pdq ®  trucking fleet and thirdparty carriers supplementing the inventory onhand at our stores our hub stores stock an additional 32000  less common skus which are available to our stores within the hub stores service area on a sameday or nextday basis

ai segment 

ais business primarily serves the commercial market with an emphasis on parts for imported cars from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states in addition its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing premium parts expert customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ais product is sold under its own proprietary brand the ai stores offer approximately 30000  skus through routine replenishment from its supply chain with access to an additional 100000 to 120000  skus through local sourcing networks 

ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september 2005 at december 29 2012  we operated 218  stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states 



the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 



seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

at february 22 2013  we employed approximately 31000  fulltime team members and approximately 24000  parttime team members our workforce consisted of 90  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 6  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption we believe that our team member relations are good 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “autopart international” “driverside” “motologic” and “service is our best part” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boysmanny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties 

our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings   

we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2435  stores at the end of fiscal 2002  to 3794  stores at december 29 2012  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

acquisition integration 

on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc strategic acquisitions have been and may continue to be an element of our growth strategy in the future acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations examples of such risks include the following 

 • we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses 

• we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems 

 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq ®  warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards 

if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 22 2013  we employed approximately 55000  team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business 

deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income while macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels consumer confidence continues to fluctuate at lower levels and payroll taxes have recently increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for 2013 this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 

impact on operating expenses 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers team members or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the implementation of healthcare and financial reform legislation as well as pending regulatory rules regarding requirements to disclose efforts to identify the origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business adversely affecting our results of operations additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace   

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber attack team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement or other acts and unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or our customers data while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and energy costs such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory 

products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern midatlantic southeastern and midwestern inclusive of south central regions of the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands these stores operate under the trade name “advance auto parts” except for certain stores in the state of florida which operate under the “advance discount auto parts” trade name at december 29 2012  we operated 3576  stores in the aap segment our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks through our integrated operating approach we serve our diy and commercial customers from our store locations and online at wwwadvanceautopartscom our online website allows our diy customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to their home or business our commercial customers can conveniently place their orders online 

at december 29 2012  we operated 218  stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name ais business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern midatlantic and southeastern regions of the united states 

management overview 

we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 522  during fiscal 2012  compared to 511  for fiscal 2011  the increase in our diluted eps was driven by a lower average share count during fiscal 2012 partially offset by a decrease in operating income throughout most of fiscal 2012 our sales remained constrained particularly in our colder weather markets driven by the unseasonably warmer temperatures which has decreased the demand for failure and maintenance parts the uncertainty in the us economy also impacted our sales consistent with many other retailers including our peer companies in the automotive aftermarket industry as consumers faced high unemployment fluctuating gas prices and low consumer confidence in response to the difficult sales environment we focused on providing better service to our commercial customers and improving weekend staffing to better serve our diy customers despite our lower performance in fiscal 2012 we remain encouraged by i the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry ii initiatives that are underway in support of our strategies and iii our growth potential in the more fragmented and faster growing commercial market 

while our operating income in fiscal 2012 declined from the comparable period of last year we generated a significant amount of operating cash flow to enable us to invest in capital projects and initiatives to support our strategies as discussed later in the business and industry update we remain committed to investing in our two key strategies – superior availability and service leadership

business update 

our two key strategies superior availability and service leadership remained unchanged in fiscal 2012 and continue to serve as the foundation for all of the initiatives we undertake superior availability is focused on consistently improving product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our local market availability service leadership relies on superior availability and a more consistent execution of serving our diy and commercial customers needs whether in our stores or online through these two key strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term sales to commercial customers remain the biggest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 38 in fiscal 2012 compared to 37 in fiscal 2011 

we believe our current initiatives are key for our longterm sales growth and improvement in our gross profit rate combined with our focus on balancing support and discretionary expenses with the additional cost of investments in our key strategies we are committed to achieving our longerterm growth and profitability goals as we enter fiscal 2013 the key initiatives under our strategies include 

 

acquisition 

on december 31 2012 we acquired bwp distributors inc bwp a privately held company that supplies markets and distributes automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers bwp operates or supplies 216 locations in the northeastern united states we believe this acquisition will enable us to continue our expansion in the competitive northeast which is a strategic growth area for us due to the large population and overall size of the market and to gain valuable information to apply to our existing operations as a result of bwps expertise in commercial as a result of this transaction we will operate 124 bwp companyowned stores and two distribution centers we will begin integrating the bwp locations in fiscal 2013 

automotive aftermarket industry 

operating within the automotive aftermarket industry we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry these factors include but are not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates consumer confidence and competition the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continues to impact us and the retail industry in general while we believe that the current macroeconomic environment continues to constrain consumer spending we remain confident that the longterm dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry are positive furthermore we continue to believe we are well positioned to serve our customers by meeting their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items historically the longterm trend in miles driven in the us has steadily increased however according to the department of transportation total miles driven in the us remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2011 as the us experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions historically rapid increases in fuel prices have also negatively impacted total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel average gasoline prices increased approximately 25 during this same time frame while gas prices remain somewhat volatile and are not predicted to return to prerecessionary levels gas prices were relatively flat when comparing the average price of gas in 2012 to 2011 and the number of miles driven in 2012 increased approximately 06 as measured through october we believe that as the us economy continues to recover and gasoline prices stabilize further annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 

number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age 

we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry there were 241 million vehicles on the road in 2011 which is 15 higher than in 2001 while recent industry data reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association “aaia” indicates that the growth in number of vehicles on the road has decelerated and new vehicle registrations are increasing the average age of vehicle continues to increase the average age of vehicles has gradually increased over the last five years from 103 years in 2008 to 113 years in 2012 we believe that the average age of vehicles continues to increase due to relatively constant scrappage rates a rate of new car sales well under the 10year trend and an increase in overall quality of vehicles as the average age of a vehicle increases a larger percentage of the 

miles driven are outside of the manufacturer warranty period these outofwarranty older vehicles generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures we believe that consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy slowly recovers contributing to the trend of an aging vehicle population 

  store development by segment 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  by segment we lease 78  of our aap stores we lease 100  of our ai stores all of our ai stores have commercial delivery programs 

  

  

during fiscal 2013  we anticipate opening 155 to 165 aap stores and 10 to 15  ai stores excludes 124 bwp stores acquired on december 31 2012 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our ecommerce website our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume commitments when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expense store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs closed store expense impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs

aap segment sales were 59149 million  an increase of 300 million  or 05  over fiscal 2011  this growth was primarily a result of sales from the net addition of 116  new stores over the past year partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 09  the comparable store sales decrease was driven by a decrease in transaction count partially offset by an increase in transaction value despite more promotional activity in response to lower customer demand the increase in transaction value is primarily due to i the gradual increase in cost and complexity of automotive parts and commodity prices and ii and the positive impact from a higher mix of commercial sales ai segment sales were 3061 million  an increase of 51 million  or 17  over fiscal 2011

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2012  was 338  million or 05  of net sales as compared to 309  million or 05  of net sales in fiscal 2011  the increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the higher average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011

aap produced sales of 58849 million  an increase of 1938 million  or 34  over fiscal 2010  the aap comparable store sales increase of 19  was driven by an increase in average sales per customer ai produced sales of 3011 million  an increase of 516 million  or 207  over fiscal 2010

gross profit for fiscal 2011  was 30693 million  or 497  of net sales as compared to 29613 million  or 500  of net sales in fiscal 2010  a decrease of 24  basis points this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by increased shrink expense supply chain deleverage due to investments in hubs and higher fuel costs and commodity price inflation partially offset by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities such as global sourcing and price optimization and improved parts availability 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for fiscal 2011  were 24046 million  or 390  of net sales as compared to 23764 million  or 401  of net sales for fiscal 2010  a decrease of 114  basis points this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation as a result of lower comparable store sales growth compared to the prior year store labor leverage resulting from productivity improvements driven by our new variable customer driven labor model occupancy cost leverage and a decrease in administrative expenses partially offset by increased strategic investments and advertising these investments included spending in the ecommerce and commercial areas of our business in support of our superior availability and service leadership strategies

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2011  was 309 million  or 05  of net sales as compared to 269 million  or 05  of net sales in fiscal 2010  the increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the amortization of the previously recorded losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of our interest rate swaps and higher average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  the interest rate swaps were associated with bank debt which we repaid near the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2010

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds for acquisitions to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offering as needed we believe funds generated from our   expected   results of   operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

at december 29 2012  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 5981 million  an increase of 5402 million  compared to december 31 2011  the end of fiscal 2011  this increase in cash was primarily a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of senior unsecured notes partially offset by investments in property and equipment and net payments on our credit facilities additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of fiscal 2012  activity to fiscal 2011  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

at december 29 2012  our outstanding indebtedness was 6051 million  or 1891 million  higher when compared to december 31 2011  and consisted of borrowings of 5989 million  under our senior unsecured notes and 62 million  outstanding on economic development notes additionally we had 788 million  in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility to 6712 million  

subsequent to year end we used 1882 million  of cash on hand to fund the purchase price and related expenses for our acquisition of bwp as discussed earlier in this managements discussion and analysis and more fully in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems while we lease the vast majority of our store locations we develop and own a small percentage of new store locations depending on market conditions our capital expenditures were 2712 million  in fiscal 2012  an increase of 31 million  over fiscal 2011  

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in our existing stores information technology and our supply chain network in fiscal 2013  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2750 million to 3000 million  these investments will be primarily driven by new store development leased and owned locations investments in our existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including continued investments in our supply chain network and new systems we anticipate opening 155 to 165 aap stores and 10 to 15  ai stores during fiscal 2013  excluding the 124 bwp stores acquired on december 31 2012 

stock repurchase program 

our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec 

during fiscal 2012  we repurchased 03 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 196 million  or an average price of 7618  per share at december 29 2012  we had  4924 million  remaining under our 500 million  stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on may 14 2012 additionally during fiscal 2012  we repurchased 01 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 75 million  or an average price of 8242  per share in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock 

dividend 

since fiscal 2006 our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of 006  per share to stockholders of record on february 5 2013  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006  per share to be paid on april 5 2013  to all common stockholders of record as of march 22 2013  

commercial credit program 

during fiscal 2012  we transitioned our commercial credit program from using a third party financial institution to settle credit transactions with our commercial customers to processing those transactions internally benefits we expect to realize include a higher level of service with our commercial customers and having a capability in place to increase the amount of commercial sales on credit while realizing cost savings over the longterm 

our concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we also mitigate our exposure to credit risk through a credit approval process including credit checks predetermined credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures 

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  is reflected in the table and following discussion 



operating activities 

for fiscal 2012  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1436 million  to 6853 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to 

 

partially offsetting the decrease in operating cash flow was 

 

for fiscal 2011  net cash provided by operating activities increased 1627 million to 8288 million  this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to 

 

investing activities 

for fiscal 2012  net cash used in investing activities decreased by 170 million  to 2730 million  the decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for business acquisitions 

for fiscal 2011  net cash used in investing activities increased by 906 million to 2900 million  the increase in cash used was primarily driven by investments in our existing stores supply chain and information technology as well as the acquisition of two small technology companies in support of our ecommerce strategy the majority of the increase in our supply chain investments is related to the completion of our remington distribution center 

financing activities 

for fiscal 2012  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 6681 million  to 1279 million  this increase was primarily a result of 

 

partially offsetting these increases was a 2300 million decrease in net borrowings on credit facilities 

for fiscal 2011  net cash used in financing activities increased by 326 million to 5402 million  cash used in financing activities increased as a result of 

 

partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 162 million in net borrowings 

longterm debt 

bank debt 

we have a 7500 million  unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with our whollyowned subsidiary advance stores company incorporated or stores serving as the borrower the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 2500 million  up to a total commitment of 1 billion during the term of the revolving credit facility voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures on may 27 2016 

as of december 29 2012  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of 788 million  which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to 6712 million  the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 15  per annum for each of the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility fee rate is 025  per annum under the terms of the revolving credit facility the interest rate and facility fee are based on our credit rating 

our revolving credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability to among other things 1 permit the subsidiaries of advance stores to create incur or assume additional debt 2 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 3 make loans and investments including acquisitions 4 guarantee obligations 5 engage in certain mergers and liquidations 6 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries 7 enter into certain hedging transactions and 8 change our status as a holding company we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio we were in compliance with our covenants in place at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively our revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default covenant defaults and crossdefaults to other material indebtedness 

senior unsecured notes 

our 575  senior unsecured notes were issued in april 2010 at 99587  of the principal amount of 300 million  and are due may 1 2020 the 2020 notes the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year our 450  senior unsecured notes were issued in january 2012 at 99968  of the principal amount of 300 million  and are due january 15 2022 the 2022 notes or collectively with 2020 notes the notes the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year we served as the issuer of the notes with certain of our domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures collectively the “indenture” among us the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in each of the indentures for the notes we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture i upon the release of the guarantee of our other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt ii upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor or iii upon our exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option 

as of december 29 2012  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited in addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2012  we had no offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations at december 29 2012  were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 6 longterm debt  note 14 income taxes  note 15 lease commitments  note 16 contingencies  and note 17 benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

 cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 1030 million  and 827 million  at december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 29 2012  would have affected net income by approximately 64 million  for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  were 314 million  308 million  and 182 million  respectively 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores over the course of the year results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 

while our shrink expense increased in fiscal 2011 from a loss of inventory as determined by the completion of physical inventories in our stores our shrink rate has fluctuated less than 40 basis points over the last three years historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve furthermore we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 29 2012  would have affected net income by approximately 20 million  for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an 

obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 29 2012  would have affected net income by approximately 24 million  for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  were 945 million  989 million  and 971 million  respectively historically our total selfinsurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles in fiscal 2012 we experienced a reduction in our selfinsurance reserves primarily due to a drop in severity of medical claims and favorable claims development related to our workers compensation claims 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle 

effective january 1 2011 we classified 503 million  of our selfinsurance liability as longterm because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 29 2012  would have affected net income by approximately 59 million  for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012  

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth we have allocated our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within each of our reportable segments to multiple reporting units in our aap segment and to the entire ai segment respectively 

during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

income tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 29 2012  would have affected net income by approximately 17 million  for the fiscal year ended december 29 2012

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate risk 

our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates historically we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges 

from september 2011 through january 2012 we executed a series of forward treasury rate locks in anticipation of the issuance of the 2022 notes the treasury rate locks which are derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges to offset our exposure to increases in the underlying us treasury benchmark rate this rate was used to establish the fixed interest rate for our 2022 notes which was comprised of the underlying us treasury benchmark rate plus a credit spread premium upon issuance of the 2022 notes the cumulative change in fair market value of the treasury rate locks was not significant due to the narrow margin between the lock rate and the underlying treasury rate 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at the company’s option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin at december 29 2012  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility however if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or an alternate base rate there is no interest rate risk associated with our 2020 notes or 2022 notes as the interest rates are fixed at 575 and 450 respectively per annum 

credit risk 

our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength we have not historically had significant credit losses

in fiscal 2011  we purchased merchandise from approximately 500 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 9 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers some of these brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  federalmogul moog ®  or moog ®  monroe ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  trico ®  and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ®

we currently operate eight  aap distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “picktolight” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems we have ongoing supply chain initiatives to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity among these initiatives is the planned opening of our ninth aap distribution center in 2012 the new distribution center will provide needed capacity to support our product availability initiatives and will utilize updated technology to eventually be implemented throughout our entire supply chain network 

store inventories are replenished from our eight  distribution centers we utilize reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores in addition to a stores normal inventory assortment we currently offer approximately 81000  skus to support all of our retail stores via our 22  standalone pdq ®  warehouses andor our eight  distribution centers all of which stock pdq ®  items stores have visibility through our epc system to inventory in their respective pdq ®  warehouses and distribution centers as well as facilities throughout the company and can place orders to these facilities through an online ordering system ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a sameday or nextday basis through our dedicated pdq ®  trucking fleet and thirdparty carriers supplementing the inventory onhand at our stores our hub stores stock an additional 27000  less common skus which are available to our stores within the hub stores service area on a sameday or nextday basis

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 



seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate

competition 

we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boysmanny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased parts providers these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases more favorable vendor relationships lower prices and better product warranties 

our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings   

we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from 2484 stores at the end of fiscal 2001 to 3662  stores at december 31 2011  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

• the availability of desirable store locations 

• the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

• the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

• our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq ®  warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 25 2012  we employed approximately 53000  team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during 2008 and 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income although the macroeconomic conditions have improved since 2008 and 2009 unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels coupled with low consumer confidence this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 

impact on operating expenses 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product acquisition costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we work hard to maintain the privacy and security of our customer and business information and the functioning of our computer systems and website in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace   

the nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services register on our websites or otherwise communicate and interact with us while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems and website a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

consequently despite our efforts the possibility of intrusion interruption of our business cyber security incidents and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with each of these remain while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornados earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and energy costs such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners 

fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31st of each year which results in an extra week every several years fiscal 2008 contained 53 weeks our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53week fiscal 2008 

introduction 

we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts accessories batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states our stores carry an extensive product line for cars vans sport utility vehicles and light trucks we serve both diy and commercial customers our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver product from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers at december 31 2011  we operated 3662  stores throughout 39  states puerto rico and the virgin islands 

we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” and “western auto” at december 31 2011  we operated 3460  stores in the aap segment of which 3434  stores operated under the trade names “advance auto parts” and “advance discount auto parts” throughout 39  states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks in addition we operated 26  stores under the “advance auto parts” and “western auto” trade names located in puerto rico and the virgin islands or offshore the aap segment also includes our ecommerce operations 

at december 31 2011  we operated 202  stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name ais business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern and midatlantic regions of the united states and florida in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 

management overview 

we generated earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 511  during fiscal 2011  compared to 395  for fiscal 2010  the increase in our diluted eps was driven by an increase in our operating income and the repurchase of shares of our common stock our overall financial results steadily improved throughout fiscal 2011  primarily due to improving sales trends and decrease of our selling general and administrative sga expense rate we believe our strong financial results have been driven by favorable industry dynamics adjustments we made earlier in the year to slow the pace and breadth of change from the implementation of our strategic initiatives and the benefits from the investments we have made over the last several years to support our service leadership and superior availability strategies 

our sga rate decreased as a result of less incentive compensation productivity improvements from our new variable store labor model which enables us to better staff our stores to customer demand and a focused reduction in administrative expenses partially offset by additional costs associated with initiatives under our two key strategies and increased advertising partially offsetting our sga leverage during fiscal 2011 was a slightly lower gross profit ratethis decrease in gross profit rate compared to fiscal 2010  was due to a number of internal and external factors including higher shrink expense additional supply chain costs associated with our supply chain investments and commodity price inflation combined with the timing of retail price changes 

the 24 increase in our operating cash flow in fiscal 2011  compared to the prior year allowed us to repurchase shares of our common stock and invest in capital improvements and initiatives to support our strategies as discussed in the business update  below we remain committed to investing in our two key strategies

business update 

in fiscal 2011  we increased our focus on differentiating advance from our competition through our commitment to exceptional service which is reflected in our new customer promise – service is our best part ®  – and the simplification of our previous four key strategies into two strategies – service leadership and superior availability superior availability centers around product availability and maximizing the speed reliability and efficiency of our supply chain service leadership leverages our product availability in addition to more consistent execution to strengthen our integrated operating approach of serving our diy and commercial customers whether in our stores or online through these two key strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the longterm 

our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 37  for fiscal 2011  as compared to 34  in fiscal 2010  since 2008 we completed incremental investments in additional parts professionals delivery trucks and drivers in a significant number of our aap stores with commercial programs we decelerated the pace of these investments during fiscal 2011 to focus and achieve better execution in those areas we believe have a direct impact on customer satisfaction for both our commercial and diy customers such as labor scheduling training commercial delivery speed and accuracy and increased advertising our ecommerce operations continue to supplement our store sales growth through an increase in diy sales from our advanceautopartscom website and more recently through the added capability for our commercial customers to order product online on an ongoing basis we closely monitor independent customer satisfaction scores for both commercial and diy customers as a measure of customer service and product availability 

our commercial and diy sales and total gross profit have benefited from our added parts availability and merchandising initiatives we continue to expand our supply chain network to increase our ability to get the right product to our customers in a timely manner we upgraded the inventory levels in 814 of our stores during fiscal 2011 and added 68 stores to our hub store network during fiscal 2011 bringing the total number of hubs to 294 our hub stores stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory and provide sameday delivery to our other stores or customers in their respective areas we plan to open our ninth aap distribution center in remington indiana during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 this new facility will provide productivity improvements resulting from the added capacity and a more advanced distribution system we continue to increase the amount of product we source globally which we believe will improve our gross profit across numerous product categories and allow us to more quickly source the products our customers need 

we anticipate that the pace of our growth in commercial will continue to exceed the pace of our diy growth the continued growth in our commercial sales emphasizes our focus on an integrated service model and our goal of achieving a 5050 mix of commercial and diy sales we believe our current initiatives are key for our longterm sales growth and improvement in our gross profit rate combined with our focus on balancing support and discretionary expenses with the additional cost of investments in our key strategies we are committed to achieving our longerterm growth and profitability goals 

automotive aftermarket industry 

the automotive aftermarket industry remains strong despite volatility in the overall economic environment favorable industry dynamics include 

  

   

conversely there are a number of factors which are negatively affecting the automotive aftermarket industry and include 

  

   

given the uncertainty in the economic environment we have adjusted our operations and financial plans without compromising our core strategic investments over the longterm we believe that the execution of the various initiatives under our key strategies will allow us to continue to increase our share of the total automotive aftermarket with a higher growth potential driven by the more fragmented commercial market 

  

store development by segment 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  by segment we lease approximately 80  of our aap stores we lease 100  of our ai stores all of our ai stores have commercial delivery programs 

  

  

during fiscal 2012  we anticipate adding 110 to 120 aap stores and 10 to 20 ai stores and closing approximately 10 total stores  

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers and sales from our ecommerce website our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including ecommerce sales we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expense store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs closed store expense impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2011  were 61705 million  an increase of 2453  million or 41  over net sales for fiscal 2010  this growth was primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales and sales from aap and ai stores opened within the last year 

aap produced sales of 58849  million an increase of 1938 million or 34 over fiscal 2010  the aap comparable store sales increase of 19  was driven by an increase in average sales per customer ai produced sales of 3011  million an increase of 516 million or 207 over fiscal 2010  

  



  

gross profit 

gross profit for fiscal 2011  was 30693  million or 497  of net sales as compared to 29613  million or 500  of net sales in fiscal 2010  a decrease of 24  basis points this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by increased shrink expense supply chain deleverage due to investments in hubs and higher fuel costs and commodity price inflation partially offset by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities such as global sourcing and price optimization and improved parts availability 

sga expenses 

sga expenses for fiscal 2011  were 24046  million or 390  of net sales as compared to 23764  million or 401  of net sales for fiscal 2010  a decrease of 114  basis points this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation as a result of lower comparable store sales growth compared to the prior year store labor leverage resulting from productivity improvements driven by our new variable customer driven labor model occupancy cost leverage and a decrease in administrative expenses partially offset by increased strategic investments and advertising these investments included spending in the ecommerce and commercial areas of our business in support of our service leadership and superior availability strategies 

operating income 

operating income for fiscal 2011  was 6646  million representing 108  of net sales as compared to 5849  million or 99  of net sales for fiscal 2010  an increase of 90  basis points this increase was due to a lower sga rate partially offset by a slightly lower gross profit rate 

aap produced operating income of 6531 million or 111 of net sales for fiscal 2011  as compared to 5804 million or 102 of net sales for fiscal 2010  ai generated operating income for fiscal 2011  of 115 million as compared to 45 million for fiscal 2010  ais operating income increased during fiscal 2011  primarily due to the leverage of sga as a result of its improved comparable store sales and decelerated pace of new store openings in fiscal 2011  

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2011  was 309  million or 05  of net sales as compared to 269  million or 05  of net sales in fiscal 2010  the increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the amortization of the previously recorded losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of our interest rate swaps and higher average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  the interest rate swaps were associated with bank debt which we repaid near the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2010  

income taxes 

income tax expense for fiscal 2011  was 2386  million as compared to 2110 million for fiscal 2010  our effective income tax rate was 377  and 379  for fiscal 2011  and fiscal 2010  respectively 

net income 

net income was 3947  million or 511  per diluted share for fiscal 2011  as compared to 3461  million or 395  per diluted share for fiscal 2010  as a percentage of net sales net income for fiscal 2011  was 64  as compared to 58  for fiscal 2010  the increase in diluted eps was primarily driven by an increase in net income and our repurchase of 99 million  shares of our common stock in fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2010  compared to fiscal 2009 

we have presented our financial results in this form 10k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap accordingly our financial results for fiscal 2009 include the financial impact resulting from the closure of 45 stores in connection with our store divestiture plan charges taken as a result of these closures had the effect of reducing eps by 017 in fiscal 2009 

net sales 

  

net sales for fiscal 2010  were 59252  million an increase of 5126  million or 95  over net sales for fiscal 2009  this growth was primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales and sales from new aap and ai stores opened during fiscal 2010 

  

aap produced sales of 56911  million an increase of 4728 million or 91 over fiscal 2009  the aap comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales as well as an increase in overall customer traffic ai produced sales of 2495  million an increase of 469 million or 232 over fiscal 2009  

  



gross profit 

gross profit for fiscal 2010  was 29613  million or 500  of net sales as compared to 26442  million or 489  of net sales in fiscal 2009  or an increase of 113  basis points this increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities such as price optimization improved parts availability and supply chain efficiencies we believe the added parts availability has been a primary driver of our increase in parts sales which generally contribute a higher gross profit favorable product costs from global sourcing are beginning to drive improvements in our gross profit on accessories

sga expenses for fiscal 2010  were 23764  million or 401  of net sales as compared to 21898  million or 405  of net sales for fiscal 2009  representing a decrease of 35  basis points this overall decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to the absence of store divestiture costs in fiscal 2010 leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs driven by our 80 comparable store sales increase in fiscal 2010 and a planned decrease in incremental spending on our strategic capabilities partially offset by increased incentive compensation and advertising 

operating income 

operating income for fiscal 2010  was 5849  million representing 99  of net sales as compared to 4544  million or 84  of net sales for fiscal 2009  or an increase of 148  basis points this increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales reflects a significant increase in sales and gross profit rate combined with a slightly lower sga expense rate 

aap produced operating income of 5804 million or 102 of net sales for fiscal 2010  as compared to 4468 million or 86 of net sales for fiscal 2009  ai generated operating income for fiscal 2010  of 45 million as compared to 76 million for fiscal 2009  ais operating income decreased during fiscal 2010 primarily due to a lower gross profit rate as well as higher sga expenses associated with the acceleration of new store openings 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2010  was 269  million or 05  of net sales as compared to 233  million or 04  of net sales in fiscal 2009  the increase in interest expense as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of the amortization of previously recorded unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of interest rate swaps the swaps are associated with bank debt which we repaid near the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

income taxes 

income tax expense for fiscal 2010  was 2110  million as compared to 1613 million for fiscal 2009  our effective income tax rate was 379 and 374 for fiscal 2010  and fiscal 2009  respectively 

net income 

net income was 3461  million or 395  per diluted share for fiscal 2010  as compared to 2704  million or 283  per diluted share for fiscal 2009  as a percentage of net sales net income for fiscal 2010  was 58  as compared to 50  for fiscal 2009  the increase in diluted earnings per share was primarily due to growth in our operating income and the decrease in our average share count as a result of our repurchase of 130 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2010 

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 



liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes in addition we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offering as needed we believe funds generated from our   expected   results of   operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

at december 31 2011  our cash and cash equivalents balance was 579  million a decrease of 13  million compared to january 1 2011  the end of fiscal 2010  this decrease in cash primarily resulted from the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the purchase of property and equipment partially offset by cash inflow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of fiscal 2011  activity to fiscal 2010  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows  section 

at december 31 2011  our outstanding indebtedness was 4160  million or 1142 million  higher when compared to january 1 2011  and consisted of borrowings of 1150  million under our revolving credit facility 2989  million under our senior unsecured notes 19 million outstanding on an economic development note and 02 million outstanding under other financing arrangements additionally we had 966  million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility to 5384  million the letters of credit serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies and routine purchases of imported merchandise 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems our capital expenditures were 2681  million in fiscal 2011  or 685 million more than fiscal 2010  during fiscal 2011  we opened 95  aap stores and 9  ai stores remodeled 15 aap and 3 ai stores and relocated 7  aap and 3  ai stores 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and supply chain networks we anticipate adding 110 to 120 aap stores and 10 to 20 ai stores and closing approximately 10 total stores  during fiscal 2012  

we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and additional investments in our supply chain information technology and other capabilities to support our key strategies in fiscal 2012  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2750 million to 3000 million these investments will be primarily driven by new store development investments in our existing store base and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies including supply chain and new systems these expenditures include a new warehouse management system and costs associated with the completion of our remington in distribution center scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2012 

stock repurchase program 

our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec 

during fiscal 2011  we repurchased 99 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 6097 million  or an average price of 6151  per share at december 31 2011  we had  2000 million  remaining under our 3000 million  stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on august 9 2011 additionally during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 01 million  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 65 million  or an average price of 6372  per share in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock 

dividend 

since fiscal 2006 our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record subsequent to december 31 2011  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 6 2012 to all common stockholders of record as of march 23 2012 

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  is reflected in the table and following discussion 



operating activities 

for fiscal 2011  net cash provided by operating activities increased 1627 million to 8288 million  this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to 

 

for fiscal 2010  net cash provided by operating activities decreased 335 million to 6662 million  this net decrease in operating cash flow was driven primarily by 

 

partially offsetting the decrease in cash flows for fiscal 2010 was an increase in net income of 757 million 

investing activities 

for fiscal 2011  net cash used in investing activities increased by 906 million to 2900 million  the increase in cash used was primarily driven by investments in our existing stores supply chain and information technology as well as the acquisition of two small technology companies in support of our ecommerce strategy the majority of the increase in our supply chain investments is related to the completion of our remington distribution center 

for fiscal 2010  net cash used in investing activities increased by 138 million to 1994 million  the increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in new store development expenditures information technology investments and a decrease in proceeds from sales of property and equipment 

financing activities 

for fiscal 2011  net cash used in financing activities increased by 326 million to 5402 million  cash used in financing activities increased as a result of 

 

partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 162 million in net borrowings 

for fiscal 2010  net cash used in financing activities increased by 561 million to 5076 million  cash used in financing activities increased as result of a 5224 million increase in the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs this was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by financing activities as a result of 

 

longterm debt 

bank debt 

on may 27 2011 we entered into a new 7500 million  unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with our whollyowned subsidiary advance stores company incorporated or stores serving as the borrower this new facility replaced our previous revolving credit facility proceeds from the new revolving credit facility were used to repay 1650 million of principal outstanding on our previous revolving credit facility in conjunction with this refinancing we incurred 37 million  of financing costs which we will amortize over the term of the new revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 3000 million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million  we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 2500 million  up to a total commitment of 1 billion during the term of the revolving credit facility voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures on may 27 2016 

as of december 31 2011  we had 1150  million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of 966  million which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to 5384  million the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 15  and 05  per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility payable in arrears the current facility fee rate is 025  per annum under the terms of the revolving credit facility the interest rate and facility fee are based on our credit rating 

our revolving credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability to among other things 1 create incur or assume additional debt 2 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 3 make loans and investments including acquisitions 4 guarantee obligations 5 engage in certain mergers and liquidations 6 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries 7 enter into certain hedging transactions and 8 change our status as a holding company we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio we were in compliance with our covenants in place at december 31 2011  and january 1 2011  respectively our revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default covenant defaults and crossdefaults to other material indebtedness 

senior unsecured notes 

our 575  senior unsecured notes the 2020 notes were issued in april 2010 at 99587  of the principal amount of 300  million and are due may 1 2020 we served as the issuer of the 2020 notes with certain of our domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors the terms of the 2020 notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures collectively the “indenture” among us the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank national association as trustee 

the 2020 notes bear interest at a rate of 575 per year payable semiannually in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year we may redeem some or all of the 2020 notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption price described in the indenture in addition in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2020 notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date the 2020 notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the 2020 notes under the circumstances described in the indenture 

subsequent to december 31 2011 we entered into an underwriting agreement on january 11 2012 pursuant to which we sold 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 450  notes due january 15 2022 the 2022 notes at a public offering price of 99968  of the principal amount per note the 2022 notes bear interest at a rate of 450 per year payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year commencing on july 15 2012 the terms of the 2022 notes are also governed by the indenture and contain similar redemption repurchase and guarantee terms as the 2020 notes 

we received approximately 2975 million  in net proceeds from the 2022 notes offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes the 2022 notes offering was part of our capital structure plan to continue to improve our financial foundation by securing longer term funding at favorable terms to help fund our future growth 

as of december 31 2011  we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and from moody’s investor service of baa3 the current outlooks by standard  poor’s and moody’s are both stable the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest rate may decrease in addition if our credit ratings decline our access to financing may become more limited 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011  we had no offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303 of the sec regulations we include other offbalancesheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

contractual obligations 

in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations at december 31 2011  were as follows 



note for additional information refer to note 6 longterm debt  note 14 income taxes  note 15 lease commitments  note 16 store closures and impairment  note 17 contingencies  and note 18 benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules of this annual report on form 10k our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements accordingly we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sga are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendors products are included as an offset to sga when the cost is incurred certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 827 million  and 720 million  at december 31 2011  and january 1 2011  respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations historically the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant a 10 difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december 31 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 52 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales conversely a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  were 308 million  182 million  and 285 million  respectively 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things 

we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories results from other targeted inventory counts and historical and current loss trends in our distribution facilities we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

  

our inventory consists primarily of parts batteries accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives although the risk of obsolescence is minimal we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit in certain situations we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 

our total inventory reserves increased by 126 million in fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase in shrink during fiscal 2011  future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 31 2011  would have affected net income by approximately 19 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturers warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 31 2011  would have affected net income by approximately 24 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  were 989 million  971 million  and 937 million  respectively historically our total selfinsurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth including an increase in stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles while these factors continued to contribute to the overall increase in our selfinsurance reserves in fiscal 2011 we also experienced favorable claims development primarily related to our workers compensation claims which helped to offset the increase 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle 

effective january 1 2011 we classified 503 million  of our selfinsurance liability as longterm because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 31 2011  would have affected net income by approximately 62 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth 

it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as our future expectations we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material a 10 change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at december 31 2011  would have affected net income by approximately 67 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011  

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 31 2011  would have affected net income by approximately 25 million for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our aap stores during the past five years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

store technology   our storebased information systems which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of a proprietary pos system and electronic parts catalog or epc system information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system and enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year make model and engine type of their vehicles our centrallybased epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated accurate parts information 

our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and userfriendly navigation tools that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete an automotive repair project if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our stores the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our pdq Ò system available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store pdq Ò or master pdq Ò with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time

store support center 

merchandising   purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations 

 

 

 

our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories oil and chemicals our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 

in fiscal 2010 we purchased merchandise from approximately 450 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 8 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process the merchandising team continues to refine its category management process including the ongoing multiphase implementation of a bestinclass category management system we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

  

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers some of these brands include bosch ®  castrol ®  dayco ®  federalmogul moog ®  or moog ®  monroe ®  prestone ®  purolator ®  t rico ® and wagner ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers these lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as autocraft ®  driveworks ®  tough one ® and wearever ®  

supply chain   our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses hub’s and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center pdq ® warehouse hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment system utilizes the most uptodate information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our stores benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain iii a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs v 

  

decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store instock position we utilize two reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores 

we currently operate eight distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “picktolight” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems we have ongoing supply chain initiatives in our distribution centers to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current supply chain network including a new distribution center projected to open in indiana in late 2011 provides ample capacity for our projected growth in the foreseeable future 

store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers we currently offer approximately 59000 skus to support all of our retail stores via our 22 standalone pdq ® warehouses andor our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq ® items stores have system visibility to inventory in their respective pdq Ò warehouses and distribution centers and can place orders to these facilities or as an alternative through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq ® trucking fleet and thirdparty carriers supplementing the inventory onhand at our stores our hub stores stock an additional 12000 less common skus which are available to our stores within the hub stores’ respective service area on a same day or next day basis in addition we operate a master pdq ® warehouse that stocks approximately 29000 incremental skus of hardertofind automotive parts and accessories and utilizes our existing pdq ® distribution infrastructure andor third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 

marketing  advertising     we have a marketing and advertising program designed to drive awareness and consideration of the advance auto parts brand by positioning aap as the service leader in the aftermarket auto parts category we strive to exceed consumers’ expectations through our free and valueadded services extensive parts assortment and quality merchandise offerings we market our brand through a mix of media including television direct mail promotional event signage outdoor billboards online advertising social media and advanceautopartscom 

in early 2011 we launched our ‘service is our best part sm ’ campaign the campaign was developed based on extensive research with our customers and team members and brings to life a new brand promise for advance this campaign was successfully tested in certain markets during 2010 before being rolled out nationwide in 2011 the campaign targets core diy and commercial customers and emphasizes our commitment to provide marketleading service to our customers 

our multichannel marketing communication plan is built around television direct marketing online radio and local marketing the plan is supported by public relations instore and event signage as well as mobile and social media through facebook the television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in sports entertainment and diythemed programming radio advertising airs primarily during peak drive times and on weekends we also use spanishlanguage television radio and outdoor advertising to reach our hispanic customers 

a final and key component of our advertising is our local marketing program highlighted by our title sponsorship of the advance auto parts monster jam a live familyoriented monster truck event tour and television show our brand is affixed to the show is present throughout each host arena and comes alive through the advance auto parts grinder monster trucks we are able to capitalize on the sponsorship at a store level through grinder and other monster truck appearances and through storebased customer events in conjunction with the show in addition aap also sponsors various other grassroot level events intended to positively impact the individual communities we serve including hispanic and other ethnic communities and to drive awareness and repeated store visits 

  

ai segment 

ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market with an emphasis on parts for imported cars from its store locations located throughout the northeastern and midatlantic regions of the united states and florida in addition its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ai’s product is sold under its own proprietary brand the ai stores offer approximately 24000 skus with access to an additional 100000 skus through its supply chain and local sourcing networks 

ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september 2005 at january 1 2011 we operated 194 stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 

 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

at february 26 2011 we employed approximately 29000 fulltime team members and approximately 22000 parttime team members our workforce consisted of 90 of our team members employed in storelevel operations 7 employed in distribution and 3 employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements we believe that our team member relations are good 

  

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” “western auto” “parts america” “autopart international” and “pdq ® ” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boys–manny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of automotive leadacid batteries and used automotive oil and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries and used oil at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations persons who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 

  




 item 1a  risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our 

  

  

  

revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 

 

 

for that portion of our inventory manufactured outside the united states geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

new store openings 

  

we have increased our store count significantly from 1729 stores at the end of fiscal 2000 to 3563 stores at january 1 2011 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

·   the availability of potential store locations 

·   the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

·   the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

·   our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

  

 

supply chain 

our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses and hub stores as we service our growing store base we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 

  

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 26 2011 we employed approximately 51000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs uncertain credit markets or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 

impact of credit market uncertainty 

 

significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on borrowed funds and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements additionally we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability andor willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other 

  

  

  

interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 

impact on operating expenses 

rising energy prices could directly impact our operating costs including our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment law matters payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 

 

war or acts of terrorism hurricanes tornados earthquakes or other natural disasters or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or team members or otherwise negatively impact our operations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 

terrorist attacks war in the middle east or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and energy costs such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

we rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results any such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to 

  

 

process transactions and manage inventory any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

management overview 

during fiscal 2010 we produced favorable financial results primarily due to strong comparable store sales growth an increase in our gross profit rate and the repurchase of shares of our common stock resulting in earnings per diluted share or diluted eps of 395 compared to 283 in fiscal 2009 our strong earnings and favorable management of working capital during fiscal 2010 have generated significant operating cash flow that allowed us to invest in business initiatives related to our key strategies and repurchase shares of our common stock 

although we have presented our financial results in this form 10k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our financial results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 include the impact of the following significant items our fiscal 2009 results were reduced by an eps impact of 017 resulting from the closure of 45 stores in connection with our store divestiture plan our fiscal 2008 financial results included an extra week of operations 53rd week as well as a noncash obsolete inventory writedown of 375 million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory or noncash inventory adjustment the impact of the fiscal 2008 items was a net reduction in eps of 015

business update 

our positive financial results in fiscal 2010 are a result of the investments we have made in each of our four key strategies over the past three years the successful execution of the initiatives supporting each of our strategies and favorable conditions in the automotive aftermarket our initial focus on our commercial acceleration and availability excellence strategies has resulted in consistent doubledigit increases in our commercial comparable store sales and strong overall gross profit improvement over this timeframe through our diy transformation and 

  

  

  

superior experience strategies our diy sales have also improved throughout fiscal 2010 as a result of a renewed focus on customer service in fiscal 2010 we narrowed our focus on fewer customer facing initiatives to ensure we consistently execute these initiatives in an effort to provide better customer service while decelerating our pace of incremental spending in fiscal 2011 we have begun to focus on differentiating advance from our competition through our commitment to exceptional service which is reflected in our new promise ‘service is our best part sm ’ and the convergence of our four key strategies into two strategies – service leadership and superior availability through these two strategies we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results 

our comparable store sales results for fiscal 2010 were comprised of favorable commercial and diy sales results our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased to 34 for fiscal 2010 as compared to 32 for fiscal 2009 over the past three years we have completed incremental investments in additional parts professionals delivery trucks and drivers in approximately half of our aap stores with commercial programs we decelerated our pace of completing these investments during the second half of fiscal 2010 and will continue to roll out these investments to the entire store chain at a more moderate rate over the next two years our growth in commercial is dependent on the previous investments we have made and plan on making in the future and maintaining successful relationships with our existing customers and attracting new customers if we succeed in these strategies we anticipate the pace of our growth in commercial to continue to exceed the pace of diy growth our ecommerce website is also expected to contribute to our commercial sales due to the completion of the roll out of our businesstobusiness platform during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the continued growth in our commercial sales emphasizes our focus on an integrated service model and our goal of achieving a 5050 mix of commercial and diy sales 

 

our diy initiatives include the ongoing improvement of our customer driven staffing model rollout of more effective training programs and a number of marketing strategies we are utilizing a more focused marketing approach to better target our highest potential customers and our underserved customers which has resulted in a more effective use of our advertising spending our relaunched ecommerce website has been operational for five complete fiscal quarters and is beginning to contribute favorably to our diy sales results on an ongoing basis we closely monitor independent customer satisfaction scores for both commercial and diy customers as a measure of customer service and product availability and have experienced improvement since the program’s inception 

both our commercial and diy sales have benefitted from our added parts availability and merchandising initiatives we added many new brands to our parts offering in fiscal 2009 and we continued to rollout custom assortments of product in our stores in fiscal 2010 we continue to complete additions to our supply chain network to increase our ability to get the right product to our customers as of january 1 2011 we were supporting multiple daily deliveries to a majority of our stores from our 176 hub stores and 31 parts delivered quickly or pdq ®    facilities our hub stores are larger stores that stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory in addition to driving sales we believe these initiatives are responsible for the continued improvement in our gross profit rate our gross profit rate for fiscal 2010 increased 113 basis points compared to fiscal 2009 we experienced gross profit rate improvements in both parts and nonparts categories resulting from the custom mix availability price optimization and other merchandising capabilities and the impact of our growing global sourcing operation we plan to continue increasing the amount of product we source globally which is expected to provide us significant gross profit improvement and allow us to more quickly source the products our customers need 

automotive aftermarket industry 

the automotive aftermarket industry benefitted in 2010 from the economic environment as people kept their vehicles longer other favorable industry dynamics which existed throughout most of 2010 included 

 

 

 

many of these favorable industry dynamics are continuing into 2011 we anticipate miles driven will continue to increase over the longterm future based on historical trends and the increasing number of vehicles on the road however there is the potential of market pressure from the recent increase in gas prices and the rebound of new car 

  

  

  

sales we believe that our focus on differentiating through our strategies of service leadership and superior availability will allow us to continue to increase our share of the total automotive aftermarket with a higher growth potential driven by the more fragmented commercial market

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

  

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening beginning in fiscal 2008 we began including in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly fiscal 2008 comparable store sales exclude the effect of the 53 rd week

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2010 was 269 million or 05 of net sales as compared to 233 million or 04 of net sales in fiscal 2009 the increase in interest expense as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of the amortization of previously recorded unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of interest rate swaps the swaps are associated with bank debt which we repaid near the beginning of the second quarter 

income taxes 

income tax expense for fiscal 2010 was 2110 million as compared to 1613 million for fiscal 2009 our effective income tax rate was 379 and 374 for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively

these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and occupancy expense leverage excluding store divestitures this increase in sga expenses is primarily linked to the targeted investments we are making to support each of our four key strategies which have already begun to yield benefits in our sales and gross profit results while our transformation will require continued investments in areas such as commercial ecommerce and global sourcing management plans to balance increases in fixed and variable sga expenses relative to our sales growth 

operating income

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations and capital expenditures as well as the payment of quarterly cash dividends and income tax payments in addition we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed we believe funds generated from our   expected   results of   operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

at january 1 2011 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 592 million a decrease of 408 million compared to january 2 2010 the end of fiscal 2009 this decrease in cash primarily resulted from the use of our available cash from operations and longterm borrowings to purchase property and equipment and repurchase shares of our common stock additional discussion of our cash flow results including the comparison of fiscal 2010 activity to fiscal 2009 is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 

at january 1 2011 our outstanding indebtedness was 3018 million or 976 million higher when compared to january 2 2010 and consisted of borrowings of 2988 million under our senior unsecured notes 26 million outstanding on an economic development note and 04 million outstanding under other financing arrangements additionally we had 926 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our total availability under our revolving credit facility to 6574 million the letters of credit serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies and our routine purchases of imported merchandise 

  

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings store relocations maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems our capital expenditures were 1996 million in fiscal 2010 or 67 million more than fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2010 we opened 110 aap stores and 38 ai stores remodeled 9 aap stores and relocated 9 aap and 3 ai stores 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and supply chain networks we anticipate adding approximately 110 to 120 aap and 10 to 20 ai stores and closing approximately 10 total stores during fiscal 2011 we expect to relocate and remodel existing stores only in the normal course of business 

we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and supply chain network and to invest in new information systems to support our key strategies in fiscal 2011 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2750 million to 3000 million the increase in capital expenditures over fiscal 2010 will be primarily driven by supply chain investments as part of our superior availability strategy these expenditures include a new warehouse management system and costs associated with the completion of our remington in distribution center scheduled to open in late 2011 

stock repurchase program 

our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec 

during fiscal 2010 we repurchased an aggregate of 130 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 6339 million or an average price of 4867 per share of these we repurchased 27 million shares at a cost of 1784 million under our 300 million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on august 10 2010 and 103 million shares at a cost of 4555 million under our 500 million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on february 16 2010 at january 1 2011 we had 1216 million remaining under the 300 million stock repurchase program 

at january 1 2011 02 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2010 at a cost of 150 million had not settled these shares settled subsequent to january 1 2011 

additionally we repurchased 01 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 35 million in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock 

subsequent to january 1 2011 we repurchased 19 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1216 million or an average price of 6272 per share which completed the availability under our 300 million stock repurchase program on february 8 2011 our board of directors authorized a new 500 million stock repurchase program 

dividend 

our board of directors has approved the payment of quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record since fiscal 2006 subsequent to january 1 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 8 2011 to all common stockholders of record as of march 25 2011 

other liquidity 

during the last two years we have transitioned certain of our merchandise vendors from a vendor financing program to a customermanaged services arrangement or vendor program under this vendor program a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates the participating suppliers’ ability to finance our payment obligations with designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior 

  

  

  

to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price our obligations to suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing payment terms or vendor funding created by facilitating our suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates while providing them with greater working capital flexibility 

any deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs which would reduce our anticipated savings including but not limited to causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility

critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm both cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold since these payments do not represent reimbursements for specific incremental and identifiable costs total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 720 million and 463 million at january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 respectively 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet 

date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net 

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales our inventory reserves for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were 182 million 285 million and 629 million respectively 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things 

we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories results from other targeted inventory counts and historical and current loss trends we perform cycle counts in the distribution facilities throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

  

we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions we also provide reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs at the end of fiscal 2008 we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory as a result we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by 341 

  

  

  

million and a related lifo and warehousing cost impact of 34 million this noncash expense was presented as an increase to cost of goods sold in our fiscal 2008 consolidated statement of operations following this change in inventory management approach we have been more effectively managing slow moving inventory and we intend to continue to utilize vendor return privileges when necessary 

our total inventory reserves decreased by 103 million in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the continued development of our physical inventory program combined with the increased emphasis on counting specific product categories to drive improved onhand accuracy the decrease in our inventory reserves in fiscal 2009 was primarily related to the entire utilization of our reserve for slow moving inventory established in fiscal 2008 in connection with the change in approach for slow moving inventory future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the lifecycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 1 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 11 million for the fiscal year ended january 1 2011 

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 1 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 23 million for the fiscal year ended january 1 2011 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance program started in 2001 our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were 973 million 937 million and 906 million respectively generally claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle the increase in our total selfinsurance reserves has remained consistent over the last two years and is reflective of our continued growth including an increase in total stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles 

our selfinsurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience specific factors include but are not limited to assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims 

effective january 1 2011 we classified 503 million of our selfinsurance liability as longterm because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 1 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 60 million for the fiscal year ended january 1 2011 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually during our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth 

it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as our future expectations we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material a 10 change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at january 1 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 37 million for the fiscal year ended january 1 2011 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 1 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 12 million for the fiscal year ended january 1 2011 

new accounting pronouncements

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

on april 29 2010 we issued 300 million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 575 due in 2020 and repaid 275 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan with the proceeds from the notes offering our revolving credit facility currently remains in place and matures in october 2011 therefore we may be exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in libor in the event we borrow under our revolving credit facility 

historically we have used interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact that movements in libor would have on the interest from our bank debt as we have paid off our bank debt these interest rate swaps now present their own exposure to movements in libor 

 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our interest rate swaps outstanding at january 1 2011 by expected maturity dates the table includes the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 1 2011 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

store support center 

merchandising   purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations 

 

 

 

our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories oil and chemicals our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 

in fiscal 2009 we purchased merchandise from approximately 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 9 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process the merchandising team continues to refine its category management process and has recently implemented the first phase of a category management system which consists of a multiphase implementation of an oracle system solution we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

our merchandising strategy which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch ®  castrol ®  sylvania ®  prestone ®  monroe ®  wagner ®  purolator ®  dayco ®  trico ® and federalmogul moog ®  or moog ®  in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and washandwax products to tools batteries parts and interior automotive accessories under various private label names such as wearever ® and autocraft ®  

supply chain   our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center pdq ® warehouse and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs our replenishment system utilizes the most uptodate information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by sku seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange with the remainder being sent by computer generated email or facsimile 

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our stores benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire 

 

 

supply chain iii a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs v decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store instock position we utilize two reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores 

  

we currently operate eight distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “picktolight” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives such as engineered standards in our distribution centers we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current supply chain network including a new distribution projected to open in indiana in 2011 provides ample capacity for our projected growth in the foreseeable future

ai segment 

ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market with an emphasis on parts for imported cars from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeast and midatlantic regions in addition its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ai’s product is sold under its own proprietary brand the ai stores offer approximately 18000 skus with access to an additional 17000 unique skus through its supply chain network 

ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september 2005 at january 2 2010 we operated 156 stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states 

 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 

 

 

 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

at february 26 2010 we employed approximately 29000 fulltime team members and approximately 20000 parttime team members our workforce consisted of 90 of our team members employed in storelevel operations 7 employed in distribution and 3 employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements we believe that our team member relations are good 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “western auto” “parts america” “autopart international” and “pdq ® ” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of 

 

trademarks for our proprietary products we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

  

competition 

we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep boys–manny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include store location product offerings availability quality price and customer service 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of automotive leadacid batteries and used automotive oil and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries and used oil at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations persons who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 




 item 1a  risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks both known and unknown our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs uncertain credit markets or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions impacts us through i higher operating costs from higher energy prices ii potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets and iii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers 

impact of credit market uncertainty 

 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets the interest rates on our credit facilities are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense we pay on borrowed funds additionally we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations it is possible that one or more of the banks that provides us with financing under our credit facilities may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facilities or be financially unable to provide the unused credit an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

impact on our suppliers 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions these events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

impact on our customers 

deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth financial resources and disposable income this impact could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at february 26 2010 we employed approximately 49000 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy including four key strategies introduced in 2008 to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the aforementioned risk factors adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 

 

 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the successful integration of any acquired businesses which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 

we have increased our store count significantly from 814 stores at the end of fiscal 1997 to 3420 stores at january 2 2010 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

·   the availability of potential store locations 

·   the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 

·   the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and 

·   our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

 

we may acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are unsure whether we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with any acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances then our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

 

the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact the availability and cost of merchandise and our customers and adversely impact our sales and profitability 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

furthermore terrorist attacks war in the middle east or war within or between any oil producing country 

 

would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and energy costs such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations

management overview 

during fiscal 2009 we produced favorable financial results primarily due to topline sales growth and strong gross profit improvement resulting in earnings per diluted share or eps of 283 compared to 249 in fiscal 2008 although we have presented our financial results in this form 10k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap our financial results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 include the impact of the following significant items our fiscal 2009 results were reduced by an eps impact of 017 resulting from the closure of 45 stores in connection with our store divestiture plan our fiscal 2008 financial results included an extra week of operations 53 rd week as well as a noncash obsolete inventory writedown of 375 million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory or noncash inventory adjustment the impact of the fiscal 2008 items was a net reduction in eps of 015 we generated significant operating cash flow in fiscal 2009 that allowed us to invest in business initiatives related to our four key strategies repay a significant portion of our bank debt and repurchase shares of our common stock

key strategies 

fiscal 2009 marked the end of the turnaround phase of our strategic plan we made significant investments in each of our four key strategies with the ultimate focus on the customer and growth in our business our principal focus during this turnaround phase has been on commercial acceleration and availability excellence to accelerate our growth and profitability we have made strategic choices to fund investments in each of these strategies and will continue to balance our investments between commercial and diy over the long term as we transition from our turnaround phase to a transformation phase we expect to increase our focus on customer facing capabilities to ensure our customers have a superior experience with us 

 

our commercial comparable store sales increase was 137 during fiscal 2009 our commercial sales as a percentage of total sales increased 25 basis points to 320 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 we believe our consistent growth in commercial sales and market share is being driven in part by the investments we have made over the last year and continue to make under our commercial acceleration strategy as of the end of fiscal 2009 we have made substantial investments in parts key brands and additional parts professionals delivery trucks and drivers in approximately onethird of our stores we have also increased our commercial sales force by approximately 45 from the beginning of fiscal 2009 we continue to make progress in redefining and realigning the roles and responsibilities of our operational teams in preparation for the continued growth in commercial at a faster pace than diy we plan to eventually generate closer to a 5050 mix of commercial and diy sales as a result of the highly fragmented commercial market our current market share is less than 5 of the 40 billion commercial market 

 

our fiscal 2009 diy comparable store sales increase of 17 marks our first positive increase for a full fiscal year since fiscal 2005 the overall growth in diy sales during fiscal 2009 was impacted by the acceleration of store closings the deceleration of new store openings reduced marketing spend in the second and third quarters and the absence of an ecommerce platform the industry continues to benefit from increased customer traffic as consumers are saving money by maintaining their existing vehicles rather than replacing them and miles driven have started to increase again although industry data reported by the npd group indicates the market grew slightly faster than we did during fiscal 2009 we believe we can maintain and eventually increase diy market share based on our recently revamped marketing programs and other initiatives underway in our diy transformation 

we have initiatives underway to address both the conversion rate of our existing customers as well as the consideration rate of potential customers conversion rate initiatives include the installation of traffic counters and updated phone systems to provide valuable information about the customer experience improved staffing and 

  

  

targeting certain stores with specific research and sales development efforts to help us better solve our customers’ problems and leverage the parts availability and merchandising improvements we are making in our stores regarding consideration rate we have made significant changes to our marketing program during the second half of the year which includes a more targeted approach to attract our highest potential customers we established a title sponsorship with monster jam a live family oriented motorsports event tour and television show highlighted by the racing and freestyle competition of monster trucks the monster jam tour destinations align closely with our store footprint 

 

our availability excellence strategy represents our commitment to enhance the breadth and depth of our parts availability in our stores   and improve the speed   of our parts delivery in order to help us better serve   both our   commercial   and diy customers in addition to our positive sales results we believe our ongoing investments and initiatives under this strategy are driving our strong gross profit results our gross profit for fiscal 2009 increased 149 basis points compared to fiscal 2008 excluding the noncash inventory adjustment and impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 we made significant progress in capabilities to help drive our sales and gross profit growth including the continued improvement in parts availability the strengthening and development of a price optimization capability and implementation of the first phase of our core merchandising system we also added six net pdq ® facilities and 80 larger stores which stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory or hub stores to our supply chain network and completed the implementation of engineered standards in all eight of our distribution centers to improve productivity increase efficiency and ultimately reduce distribution expenses 

we disposed of substantially all of the nonproductive inventory we identified in fiscal 2008 by the end of fiscal 2009 we continue to manage our inventory productivity by removing unproductive inventory from our store assortments through utilizing markdown strategies and our vendor return privileges we expect to manage more effectively the growth in our inventory as compared to our sales growth 

 

superior experience is centered around our store operations and providing superior customer service the successful rollout and completion of commercial and diy initiatives in our stores is greatly dependent on the superior experience strategy the feedback from our customer satisfaction surveys coupled with our team member engagement surveys provides the evidence of our continued focus and commitment to understand what our customers need and how to engage our team members to fulfill that goal we have a dedicated team of field operations leaders who are leading the rollout of initiatives over our entire store chain in a very disciplined and focused way these initiatives include improving staffing structuring operations to more effectively serve both commercial and diy customers providing sales development and coaching and driving gross profit improvements through new battery warranty procedures better pricing decisions and improved shrink control 

store divestiture plan 

for fiscal 2009 we divested a total of 45 stores that were delivering strategically or financially unacceptable results these closures were in addition to 10 stores that we closed as part of our routine review and closure of underperforming stores at or near the end of their respective lease terms during fiscal 2009 we recognized expenses of 261 million related to our store divestiture plan the majority of this expense was related to the estimated remaining lease obligations at the time of the closures as of january 2 2010 we had completed our store divestiture plan our total store closures for fiscal 2010 are estimated at 10 to 15 

change in accounting principle 

we have retrospectively adjusted all comparable periods related to cost of sales and sga as a result of a change in accounting principle effective january 4 2009 we changed our accounting for freight and other handling costs associated with transferring merchandise from our hub stores and pdq ® facilities to our retail stores from recording such costs as sga to recording such costs in cost of sales this change which had no impact to operating income or cash flows more accurately reflects the nature of the expense 

  

the net adjustment increasing cost of sales and decreasing sga was 639 million and 623 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively for additional information regarding this change see note 3 change in accounting principle  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

industry 

challenging macroeconomic conditions continue with the unemployment rate at 97 the highest in over 25 years and consumer confidence remaining low financial results from the leading automotive aftermarket companies suggest that the entire industry is benefiting from the economic downturn because consumers are keeping their vehicles longer which in turn increases the average age of vehicles and the need to repair and complete routine maintenance on those vehicles recent statistics indicate miles driven have increased three straight quarters reversing a negative trend throughout 2008 and early 2009 in addition gas prices remain well under the historic highs experienced throughout most of 2008 and the average vehicle age continues to rise and is slightly over 10 years 

in summary the economic environment continues to present mixed results to our industry with opportunities to serve customers in need of parts and other required maintenance but other elective maintenance and accessory purchases being deferred until disposable income returns to higher levels we believe we can maintain market share and eventually increase our market share in the less fragmented diy market we also believe we will continue to significantly increase our market share in the commercial market where our current market share is less than 5 of the 40 billion commercial market 

we are pleased with our fiscal 2009 financial results we remain committed to making the necessary investments to help ensure our longterm profitability and the success of our transformation as we strive to become the industry leader 

store development by segment 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 we lease approximately 81 of our stores 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we anticipate adding approximately 110 aap and 40 ai stores and closing 10 to 15 total stores 

  

critical accounting policies 

   

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations many of these incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less shortterm both cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold since these payments do not represent reimbursements for specific incremental and identifiable costs total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was 463 million at january 2 2010 

similarly we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales however these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any shortterm agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables net except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net 

inventory reserves 

our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales 

shrink may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise among other things we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories results from recent cycle counts and historical and current loss trends we perform cycle counts in the distribution facilities throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

  

we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions we also provide reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs at the end of fiscal 2008 we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory as a result we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by 341 million excluding a lifo and warehousing cost impact of 34 million this noncash expense was presented as an increase to cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations with this change in inventory management approach we intend to more effectively manage slow moving inventory and continue to utilize vendor 

 

 

return privileges when necessary 

  

our total inventory reserves decreased by 344 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily related to the entire utilization of our reserve for slow moving inventory established in fiscal 2008 in connection with the change in approach for slow moving inventory future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the lifecycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 3 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 18 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 

a 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 2 2010 would have affected net income by approximately 19 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance program started in 2001 our selfinsurance reserves for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were 937 million 906 million and 855 million respectively 

each year our reserve for selfinsurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved generally claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year we have experienced an increase in overall claims during the last three years which is generally reflective of our overall growth including an increase in total stores team members and commercial delivery vehicles while we have seen the severity and frequency of worker’s compensation and general liability claims moderate the severity and frequency of automobile liability claims have increased primarily due to the significant increase in the number of our commercial delivery vehicles 

our reserve for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported projected future claims using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding sga could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 2 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 59 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually during our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units considering other publicly available market information and using an 

 

 

independent valuation firm we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units including but not limited to size and projected growth 

  

it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as our future expectations we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material a 10 change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at january 2 2010 would have affected net income by approximately 38 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law codes regulations pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax law codes regulations and court cases along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 2 2010 would have affected net income by approximately 10 million for the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening beginning in fiscal 2008 we began including in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly fiscal 2008 comparable store sales exclude the effect of the 53 rd week 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of 

  

  

net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and v warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs and note 3 for additional discussion of a change in accounting principle for freight and other handling costs associated with transferring merchandise from hub stores and pdq ® facilities to our retail stores from recording such costs as sga to recording such costs in cost of sales 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga consists of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expense store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs closed store expense impairment charges if any and other related expenses see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs and note 3 for additional discussion of a change in accounting principle 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 

 

  

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2009 were 54126 million an increase of 2704 million or 53 over net sales for fiscal 2008 excluding the 888 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2008 our sales increase was 71 this growth was primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales of 53 and sales from the net addition of 52 new aap and ai stores opened within the last year 

 

aap produced sales of 52183 million an increase of 2417 million or 49 over fiscal 2008 excluding the 865 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2008 aap’s sales increase was 67 this growth was primarily due to a 51 comparable store sales increase and sales from the net addition of 21 new stores opened within the last year the aap comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and overall customer traffic ai produced sales of 2026 million an increase of 369 million or 223 over fiscal 2008 excluding the 23 million impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2008 ai’s sales increase was 240 this growth was primarily reflective of a 99 comparable store sales increase and sales from the net addition of 31 new stores opened within the last year

sga 

sga expenses for fiscal 2009 were 21898 million or 405 of net sales as compared to 19842 million or 386 of net sales for fiscal 2008 or an increase of 187 basis points store divestiture expenses comprised 48 basis points of the increase in sga as a percentage of net sales the remaining increase was primarily due to 

 

 

 

these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and occupancy expense leverage excluding store divestitures this increase in sga is primarily linked to the targeted investments we are making to support each of our four key strategies which have already begun to yield benefits in our sales and gross profit results while our transformation will require continued investments in areas such as commercial ecommerce and global sourcing management plans to balance increases in fixed and variable sga relative to our sales growth 

operating income 

operating income for fiscal 2009 was 4544 million or 84 of net sales as compared to 4149 million or 81 of net sales in fiscal 2008 or an increase of 33 basis points this increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales reflects an increase in gross profit partially offset by higher sga the increase in sga reflects many of the investments we are making in our business with shortterm benefits already being realized in net sales and gross profit resulting in an overall net increase in profitability the fiscal 2009 increase in our operating income also benefited from the 375 million noncash inventory adjustment partially offset by the approximately 158 million impact from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2008 

aap produced operating income of 4468 million or 86 of net sales for fiscal 2009 as compared to 4107 million or 83 of net sales in fiscal 2008 ai generated operating income for fiscal 2009 of 76 million as compared to 42 million in fiscal 2008 ai’s operating income increased primarily due to its positive sales results for the year and leverage of supply chain costs as a percentage of net sales 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2009 was 233 million or 04 of net sales as compared to 337 million or 07 of net sales in fiscal 2008 the decrease in interest expense as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of lower outstanding borrowings and increased sales during fiscal 2009 

income taxes

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2008 were 51423 million an increase of 2979 million or 61 over net sales for fiscal 2007 the net sales increase was due to contributions from the 107 net new aap and ai stores opened within fiscal 2008 888 million in sales from the 53 rd week and an increase in comparable store sales of 15 

aap produced sales of 49766 million an increase of 2672 million or 57 over fiscal 2007 aap’s sales increase was primarily driven by a 13 comparable store sales increase 865 million in sales from the 53 rd week and sales from the 90 net new stores opened within fiscal 2008 the aap comparable store sales increase was driven by i an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our commercial business and ii an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count ai produced sales of 1657 million an increase of 306 million or 227 over fiscal 2007 ai’s sales increase was primarily driven by a 92 comparable store sales increase 23 million in sales from the 53 rd week and sales from 17 net new stores opened within fiscal 2008 

gross profit 

gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 23991 million or 467 of net sales as compared to 22587 million or 466 of net sales in fiscal 2007 increasing slightly from an implemented change in accounting principle for costs included in inventory beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented herein related to gross profit gross profit for fiscal 2008 reflects a reduction of 375 million or 73 basis points resulting from a noncash inventory adjustment offsetting this reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales were improvements in gross profit from more effective pricing decreased inventory shrink and higher sales from ai which generated a higher gross profit rate the impact on gross profit from the 53 rd week was approximately 440 million and did not materially affect our gross profit rate 

sga 

sga expenses for fiscal 2008 were 19842 million or 386 of net sales as compared to 18423 million or 380 of net sales for fiscal 2007 or an increase of 56 basis points the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by investments in strategic initiatives increased incentive compensation and legal settlement costs partially offset by favorable medical costs our sga rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by approximately 14 basis points from the 53 rd week as a result of not including an additional week of fixed expenses that are typically expensed in a 52week year

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations and capital expenditures as well as the payment of quarterly cash dividends and estimated income taxes in addition we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed we believe funds generated from our   expected   results of   operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

  

at january 2 2010 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 1000 million an increase of 627 million compared to january 3 2009 the end of fiscal 2008 this increase resulted from additional cash flows from operating activities including higher net income slower growth in inventory net of our accounts payable ratio and increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase in the net repayment of debt additional discussion of our cash flow results is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 

at january 2 2010 our outstanding indebtedness was 2519 million lower when compared to january 3 2009 and consisted of borrowings of 2000 million under our term loan 33 million outstanding on an economic development note and 10 million outstanding under other financing arrangements additionally we had 998 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our total availability under the revolving credit facility to 6502 million the letters of credit serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies and routine purchases of imported merchandise 

 

we have 15 lenders participating in our revolving credit facility each with a commitment of not more than 15 of the total 750 million commitment all of these lenders have met their contractual funding commitments to us through january 2 2010 an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of proprietary information systems and purchased information systems our capital expenditures were 1929 million in fiscal 2009 or 79 million more than fiscal 2008 primarily due to routine spending on our existing stores and information technology investments partially offset by fewer stores opened and the timing of store development expenditures during fiscal 2009 we opened 75 aap and 32 ai stores remodeled 13 aap stores and relocated 6 aap and 4 ai stores 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and supply chain networks during fiscal 2010 we anticipate adding 110 new aap and 40 new ai stores we expect to relocate and remodel existing stores only in the normal course of business 

we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and supply chain network and to invest in new information systems to support our turnaround strategies including the multiyear implementation of a merchandising system in fiscal 2010 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2200 million to 2400 million 

stock repurchase program 

our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 

during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 25 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 996 million or an average price of 4036 per share leaving 894 million remaining under our 250 million stock repurchase program excluding related expenses 

subsequent to january 2 2010 our board of directors authorized a new 500 million stock repurchase program on february 16 2010 the new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of our previous 250 million stock repurchase program which was authorized on may 15 2008 as of february 26 2010 we have repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 562 million or an average price of 4040 per share under our 500 million stock repurchase program 

dividend 

our board of directors have paid quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record since fiscal 2006 subsequent to january 2 2010 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 9 2010 to all common stockholders of record as of march 26 2010 

other liquidity 

during the last two years we have transitioned certain of our merchandise vendors from a vendor financing program to a customermanaged services arrangement or vendor program under this vendor program a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates the participating suppliers’ ability to finance our payment obligations with designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price our obligations to suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing payment terms or vendor funding created by facilitating our suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates while providing them with greater working capital flexibility 

any deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs which would reduce our anticipated savings including but not limited to causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

analysis of cash flows 

a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 is reflected in the table and following discussion

investing activities

contractual obligations 

in addition to our revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations at january 2 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long term debt 

bank debt 

we have a 750 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with our whollyowned subsidiary advance stores company incorporated or stores serving as the borrower the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of 300 million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 50 million we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 250 million up to a total commitment of 1 billion during the term of the credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of   the   revolving balance   are   permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility matures on october 5 2011 

as of january 2 2010 we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding of 998 million which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to 6502 million the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less a commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the revolver payable in arrears the current commitment fee rate is 0150 per annum 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we had borrowed 200 million under our unsecured fouryear term loan as of january 2 2010 we entered into the term loan with stores serving as borrower the proceeds from the term loan were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during fiscal 2008 the term loan matures on october 5 2011 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 075 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively under the terms of the revolving credit facility the interest rate and commitment fee are based on our credit rating the interest rate on the term loan is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 10 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively under the terms of the term loan the interest rate is based on our credit rating we have elected to use the 90day adjusted libor rate and have the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings at january 2 2010 the 

 

entire portion of our bank debt was hedged through the use of interest rate swaps which effectively fixed our libor at rates ranging from 401 to 498

  

other

store support center 

merchandising   purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in our store support center in roanoke virginia and in our regional office in minneapolis minnesota in fiscal 2008 we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 9 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with certain vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

our merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process we believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category has been highly effective and is critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch ®  castrol ®  sylvania ®  prestone ®  monroe ®  wagner ®  purolator ®  dayco ®  trico ® and federalmogul moog ®  or moog ®  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and washandwax products to tools batteries parts and interior automotive accessories under various private label names

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and stores benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain iii a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs v decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store instock position we recently announced our plan to outsource our private fleet operations to two reputable dedicated carriers we believe outsourcing our private fleet operations will allow us to focus resources on achieving our key strategies improve our ability to manage transportation as we continue to grow and reduce costs 

 

we currently operate eight distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “pickto light” systems radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of 3400 aap stores we plan to open a new distribution center in indiana in 2010

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 

 

 

 

 

 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

 

team members 

at march 2 2009 we employed 27396 fulltime team members and 20186 parttime team members our 

 

 

workforce consisted of 89 of our team members employed in storelevel operations 8 employed in distribution and 3 employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements we believe that our team member relations are good

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of automotive leadacid batteries and used automotive oil and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries and used oil at all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations persons who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date

  risk factors 

tableend 

 

risks relating to our business 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

deterioration in general economic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels or unavailability of credit and high energy costs will likely have a negative impact on our customers’ ability to purchase our products and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

the deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 led many us companies to announce plant closings and employee layoffs which resulted in higher unemployment that may continue for a prolonged period of time unemployment of our customers or any decrease in the market value of their homes would have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth and financial resources and could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles although the price of gasoline decreased substantially in november and december of 2008 the price of fuel or other energy resources may increase substantially in the future higher fuel and energy costs may reduce the amount of customers’ disposable income available to purchase our products as well as reduce the number of miles driven rising energy prices may impact demand for the products we sell overall transaction count and our profitability in addition higher energy prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs and inflation or deflation could also result in a potentially material negative impact on our business financial condition profitability and cash flows 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional retail 

 

 

automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores store locations store layouts longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases lower prices and better product warranties our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or disruptions in or changes in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold andor affect the supply of automotive parts and supplies we sell 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 

 

deteriorating and uncertain credit markets could negatively impact our vendors as well as our liquidity and ability to secure additional capital at favorable costeffective terms in the future 

impact on the company’s suppliers 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company our suppliers also referred to as vendors and our customers were exposed to deteriorating and uncertain credit markets the general decline in the economy and economic conditions could negatively affect our suppliers by making it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm 

additionally if any of the major u s automobile manufacturers files a petition in bankruptcy or if other factors result in a substantial reduction in the number of new cars manufactured or in a companywide shutdown it would likely have a material negative shortterm as well as potentially longterm impact on the operations and cash flows of some of our suppliers any such negative impacts to our suppliers will likely result in the loss of certain suppliers andor in higher product costs 

impact on the company 

supplier bankruptcies would likely decrease the production output and supply of domestic and possibly foreign automobile parts and accessories thereby decreasing the availability and increasing the cost of our parts and accessories we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers any increased per unit costs of our suppliers would likely result in the company paying a higher per unit price for parts and accessories potentially resulting in higher cost of goods sold lower gross profit margins and reduced operating profits if such increased costs could not be passed onto our customers 

 

our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by the deteriorating and uncertain credit markets see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  credit ratings the interest rates on our credit facilities are linked directly to our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense we pay on borrowed funds additionally we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations in light of 

 

 

the uncertainty in the credit markets it is possible that one or more of the banks that provides us with financing under our credit facilities may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facilities or be financially unable to provide the unused credit an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members whom we may not be able to attract and retain 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members at march 2 2009 we employed 47582 team members we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy including four key turnaround strategies introduced in 2008 to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 

 

 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the successful integration of any acquired businesses which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new store openings 

 

we have increased our store count significantly from 814 stores at the end of fiscal 1997 to 3368 stores at january 3 2009 we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other 

 

 

things 

 

 

 

 

we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 

acquisitions investments or strategic alliances 

we may acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

we are unsure whether we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with any acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances then our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

 

 

 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact the availability and cost of merchandise and our customers and adversely impact our sales and profitability 

 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

furthermore terrorist attacks war in the middle east or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline diesel fuel and energy costs such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations 

risks relating to our financial condition 

the covenants governing our revolving and term loan facilities impose restrictions on us 

the terms of our revolving and term loan facilities include covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial ratios and conditions these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 

 

 

the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our credit facilities furthermore our credit facilities contain certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our credit facilities any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us

tableend 

 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under “forwardlooking statements” and risk factors elsewhere in this report 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31st of each year which results in an extra week every several years fiscal 2008 contained 53 weeks our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal 2008 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53week fiscal year in 2008 

introduction 

we operate primarily within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy and doitforme or commercial customers in the united states based on store count and sales at january 3 2009 we operated 3368 stores throughout 40 states 

we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” and “western auto” at january 3 2009 we operated 3243 stores in the aap segment of which 3215 stores operated under the trade names “advance auto parts” and “advance discount auto parts” throughout 40 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores offer automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items in addition we operated 28 stores under the “western auto” and “advance auto parts” trade names located in puerto rico and the virgin islands or offshore 

at january 3 2009 we operated 125 stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name we acquired ai in september 2005 ai operates as an independent whollyowned subsidiary ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 

management overview 

during fiscal 2008 in a challenging year of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions we accelerated topline sales growth by 61 and recorded earnings per diluted share of 250 compared to 228 in fiscal 2007 our fiscal 2008 financial results included an extra week of operations 53 rd week as well as a noncash obsolete inventory 

 

 

writedown of 375 million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory we continued to generate signi ficant operating cash flow that allowed us to invest in business initiatives and return capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases 

fiscal 2008 was a transitional year for advance which included several executive management changes and the introduction of key strategies and initiatives as we embarked on a concentrated effort to drive changes in response to diminished sales and earnings growth during fiscal 2006 and 2007 in january 2008 darren jackson was appointed to the position of president and chief executive officer mr jackson who had previously served on our board of directors audit committee and finance committee had already been involved with management on the completion of certain strategic business assessments during fiscal 2007 and the formulation of key initiatives discussed below in addition to our ceo other new management leaders joined advance in fiscal 2008 to work with existing leaders on developing and executing a turnaround plan

update on turnaround strategies 

our favorable results during fiscal 2008 were in part being driven by progress on our key turnaround strategies each of the four strategies is at a different stage of implementation 

 

 

the effectiveness of our commercial acceleration strategy is evident as we experienced double digit comparable sales increases over the last four quarters in commercial sales for fiscal 2008 we experienced a 121 commercial comparable store sales increase we continue to gain market share in a business that is very fragmented and still growing overall we have added more parts to our stores with commercial programs including key brands which are highly respected and preferred by our commercial customers we are developing a sales force to drive our commercial business another key component of the commercial acceleration strategy we are increasing the number of commercial account managers and equipping them with tools to acquire new customers and increase the volume of existing customers’ purchases we are also testing other initiatives to roll out on a larger scale that meet the needs of our commercial customers and drive shareholder value 

 

 

the initial focus of the diy transformation strategy is to turnaround our current diy sales trends utilizing targeted initiatives our diy comparable store sales decrease was 23 in fiscal 2008 with our fourth quarter improving to a decrease of 11 during fiscal 2008 we completed a 100day assessment of our diy business where a representative group of management and field team members worked together and concluded that we must continue to focus on initiatives such as parts availability attachment selling superior customer service and the proper scheduling of team members additionally we have identified certain operating areas where we are experiencing positive diy sales results which provide us with an opportunity to utilize those best practices across the entire diy business 

our ability to achieve successful results in our commercial acceleration and diy transformation strategies is dependent on our availability excellence and superior experience strategies 

 

 

the availability excellence strategy represents our commitment to enhance the breadth and depth of our parts availability in our stores   and   the speed   of our parts delivery   to better serve   both our   commercial   and diy customers this strategy incorporates our supply chain and logistics network capabilities space management and merchandising initiatives we are making progress on the parts availability initiative as the merchandising and inventory management teams partner with the commercial and diy teams to accelerate sales growth as discussed in commercial acceleration key brands of parts such as moog ® and wagner ® were added during fiscal 2008 we began the rollout of a custom mix inventory process chainwide in addition we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory we intend to increase our inventory productivity by reducing the amount of slow moving inventory and utilizing vendor return privileges earlier in the lifecycle of our inventory which will allow us to add faster moving custom mix inventory we believe this change in inventory management approach will accelerate sales improve margins and increase inventory turnover 

 

progress in other initiatives included the restructuring of our merchandising department into an integrated operating model the completion of an initial phase of a new category management process and the rollout of a new price optimization tool as previously announced we are also implementing an oracle merchandising system over a multiyear period which will serve as a key upgrade to our current merchandising systems we recently launched the company’s global sourcing capability and private brand strategy in february 2009 we announced the outsourcing of our private vehicle fleet which will allow more scheduling flexibility and reduce costs to help fund the expansion of our pdq ® network we will continue to measure progress in our availability excellence strategy using productivity metrics such as sales per square foot and gross margin return on inventory see item 6 selected consolidated financial data  for a presentation of these and other key metrics 

 

 

 

superior experience is centered around our store operations and providing superior customer service we have begun to evaluate our customer service through the measurement of team member engagement and customer satisfaction we believe we will gain valuable information from these results which will drive improvement in our results in future quarters in the fourth quarter we tested a new integrated operating model that demonstrated efficiencies in our commercial delivery business and related acceleration in commercial sales this new staffing model will begin a phasedin rollout in the first quarter of 2009 the leaders of superior experience will be reengineering the store experience and store operations as well as gaining a better understanding of what the customer ultimately wants 

industry 

the steep decline in consumer confidence rapidly rising unemployment the credit crisis and the single largest decline in annual miles driven presented challenges to retailers throughout fiscal 2008 more recently retail industry comparable store sales represented the worst retail environment in 40 years however the automotive aftermarket industry will likely have an opportunity to benefit from the economic downturn because consumers are keeping their vehicles longer which increases the average age of vehicles and the need to repair and complete routine maintenance on those vehicles 

although our fiscal 2008 results were positive our outlook is cautious for fiscal 2009 given the current economic environment we are still in the early stages of implementing our four key turnaround strategies we are committed to making the necessary investments to help ensure our longterm success 

store development by segment 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we lease approximately 81 of our stores 

 

 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 we anticipate adding approximately 75 aap and 30 ai stores and closing 10 to 15 stores excluding the stores that may be closed in connection wit h our s tore divestiture plan 

 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs including cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional incentives we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” many of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and are initially recorded as a reduction to inventory the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets net 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink for our distribution centers based on historical results from our cycle counting program and actual results from our most recent cycle counts for our store locations we establish reserves for estimated shrink based on historical results from our cycle counting program and results of physical inventories as adjusted for current economic conditions if necessary beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we began transitioning to a physical inventory process and had completed physical inventories in approximately onethird of our retail stores as of january 3 2009 

an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the results of the independent physical inventory counts and the accuracy of the cycle count program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of our cycle program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established inventory shrink reserves if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

 

we also have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels ii historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we have historically developed these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to be recorded 

 

 

if any required by market conditions at the end of fiscal 2008 we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory as a result we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by 341 million excluding a lifo and warehousing cost impact of 34 million 

our total inventory reserves increased by 273 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of the increase to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory or changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at january 3 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 39 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2009 

warranty reserves 

we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer’s warranty is borne by our vendors however we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims based on the historical return experience of the products sold and record any change as income or expense in the period the product is sold if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

our warranty reserves increased by 109 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 a portion of this obligation is funded by incentives from our vendors the overall increase in our warranty reserves was primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity and cost of batteries sold during fiscal 2008 as well as an increase in related warranty claims effective december 30 2007 the company also began including in its warranty reserves the warranty obligation on certain other products sold in addition to batteries a 10 change in the warranty reserves at january 3 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 18 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2009 

selfinsurance reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance program started in 2001 has not reached full maturity a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed claims incurred but not yet reported projected future claims using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience each year our reserve for selfinsurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved generally claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year our selfinsurance reserves increased by 50 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of workers’ compensation claims and automobile accident claims as well as an increase in the total cost to settle workers’ compensation claims as compared to the prior year although the increase in selfinsured reserves in fiscal 2008 is less than in fiscal 2007 the increase in the number of claims continues to be driven by overall growth including an increase in total number of stores employees and commercial delivery vehicles 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding selling general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at january 3 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 57 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2009 

 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax codes regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record reserves for potential exposures these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations the evolution of tax codes and regulations along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at january 3 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 14 million for the fiscal year ended january 3 2009 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods approximately one year we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening beginning in fiscal 2008 we also include in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly fiscal 2008 comparable store sales exclude the effect of the 53 rd week 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective merchandise and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs iii vendor programs iv inventory shrinkage v defective merchandise and warranty costs and v warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent and depreciation advertising expenses commercial delivery expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expense store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses selfinsurance costs and other related expenses see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 

 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2008 were 51423 million an increase of 2979 million or 61 over net sales for fiscal 2007 the net sales increase was due to contributions from the 107 net new aap and ai stores opened within the last year 888 million in sales from the 53 rd week and an increase in comparable store sales of 15 

aap produced sales of 49766 million an increase of 2672 million or 57 aap’s sales increase was primarily driven by a 13 comparable store sales increase 865 million in sales from the 53 rd week and sales from the 90 net new stores opened within the last year the aap comparable store sales increase was driven by i an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our commercial business and ii an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count ai produced sales of 1657 million an increase of 306 million or 227 ai’s sales increase was primarily driven by a 92 comparable store sales increase 23 million in sales from the 53 rd week and sales from 17 net new stores opened within the last year 

we expect to experience similar trends during fiscal 2009 as we continue to realize benefits from our turnaround strategies partially offset by the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment 

gross profit 

gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 24631 million or 479 of net sales as compared to 23210 million or 479 of net sales in fiscal 2007 remaining flat gross profit reflects a reduction of 375 million or 73 basis points or bps resulting from a noncash obsolete inventory writedown due to a change in our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory offsetting this reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales were improvements in gross profit from more effective pricing decreased inventory shrink and higher sales from ai which generated a higher gross profit rate the impact on gross profit from the 53 rd week was approximately 44 million and did not materially affect our gross profit rate 

sga 

sga expenses for fiscal 2008 were 20481 million or 398 of net sales as compared to 19045 million or 393 of net sales for fiscal 2007 or an increase of 52 basis points the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales was driven primarily by investments in strategic initiatives increased incentive compensation and legal settlement costs partially offset by favorable medical costs our sga rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably 

 

 

impacted by approximately 14 bps from the 53 rd week as a result of not including an additional week of fixed expenses that are typically expensed in a 52week year 

operating income 

operating income for fiscal 2008 was 4149 million or 81 of net sales as compared to 4164 million or 86 of net sales in fiscal 2007 or a decrease of 53 basis points aap produced operating income of 4107 million or 83 of net sales for fiscal 2008 as compared to 4172 million or 89 of net sales in fiscal 2007 ai generated operating income for fiscal 2008 of 42 million as compared to an operating loss of 08 million in fiscal 2007 operating income increased primarily due to ai’s positive sales results for the year and a decrease in payroll expense as a percentage of sales the companys overall operating income was reduced by a noncash obsolete inventory writedown of 375 million while results from the 53 rd week contributed approximately 158 million to our operating income 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2008 was 337 million or 07 of net sales as compared to 348 million or 07 of net sales in fiscal 2007 the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower average borrowing rates partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings as compared to fiscal 2007 

income taxes

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2007 were 48444 million an increase of 2279 million or 49 over net sales for fiscal 2006 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 08 and contributions from the 196 aap and ai stores opened within the prior year the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our commercial business and an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count ai produced sales of 1350 million in fiscal 2007 an increase 239 million or 216 compared to fiscal 2006 ai’s sales increase was driven primarily by our acceleration of newstore growth through fiscal 2006 and 2007

gross profit for fiscal 2007 was 23210 million or 479 of net sales as compared to 22012 million or 477 of net sales in fiscal 2006 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to improved procurement costs a positive shift in sales mix and lower logistics expense partially offset by strategic price changes associated with our focused effort on remaining competitive in the parts category

operating income 

operating income for fiscal 2007 was 4164 million or 86 of net sales as compared to 4034 million or 87 of net sales in fiscal 2006 this decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was reflective of higher selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by an increase in gross profit aap produced operating income of 4172 million or 89 of net sales for fiscal 2007 as compared to 4023 million or 89 of net sales in fiscal 2006 ai generated an operating loss for fiscal 2007 of 08 million as compared to operating income of 11 million in fiscal 2006 this decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower than anticipated sales additional expenses associated with the transition to ai’s new distribution center early in fiscal 2007 and the reinvestment of resources to accelerate ai’s store growth and roll out of certain ai branded product 

interest 

interest expense for fiscal 2007 was 348 million or 07 of net sales as compared to 360 million or 08 of net sales in fiscal 2006 the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2006

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

 

our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits the purchase of inventory contractual obligations capital expenditures as well as the payment of quarterly cash dividends in addition we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to repay borrowings under our credit facility we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed we believe funds generated from our   expected   results of   operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

 

at january 3 2009 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 374 million an increase of 227 million compared to fiscal yearend 2007 this increase resulted from additional cash flows from operating activities including higher comparable store sales and lower capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in expenditures for financing activities including the return of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 2008 additional discussion of our cash flow results is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 

at january 3 2009 our outstanding indebtedness was 495 million lower when compared to december 29 2007 and consisted of borrowings of 2515 million under our revolving credit facility 2000 million under our term loan 40 million outstanding on an economic development note and 07 outstanding under other financing arrangements additionally we had 1013 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our total availability under the revolving credit facility to 3972 million 

 

in light of the uncertainty in the credit markets it is possible that one or more of the banks in our revolving credit facility syndicate may be unable to provide our remaining available credit we have 15 lenders participating in our revolving credit facility each with a commitment of not more than 15 of the total 750 million commitment furthermore all of these lenders have met their contractual funding commitments to us through january 3 2009 an inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations store remodels prior to fiscal 2008 maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers and the development of proprietary information systems and purchased information systems our capital expenditures were 1850 million in fiscal 2008 or 256 million less than fiscal 2007 primarily due to a reduction in store development during fiscal 2008 we opened 109 aap and 18 ai stores remodeled five aap stores and relocated 10 aap stores 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and logistics networks during fiscal 2009 we anticipate adding 75 new aap and 30 new ai stores we will relocate and remodel only in the normal course of business we retired the 2010 store format and related remodel program during fiscal 2008 

we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and logistics network as well as investing in new information systems to support our turnaround strategies including the implementation of an oracle merchandising system over a multiyear timeframe in 2009 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 1800 million to 2000 million 

 

 

 

vendor financing program 

 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms we have a shortterm financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases in substance the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors this program allows us to further reduce our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth at january 3 2009 and december 29 2007 1364 million and 1535 million respectively was payable to the bank by us under this program 

 

we are anticipating the balance in financed vendor accounts payable to diminish as we transition our merchandise vendors to a customermanaged services arrangement or vendor program entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 under this vendor program a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to finance our payment obligations with designated thirdparty financial institutions participating suppliers may at their sole discretion make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price our obligations to suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment dates are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing payment terms or vendor funding created by facilitating our suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates while providing them with greater working capital flexibility

 

as of january 3 2009 we had 143 million in outstanding payables under our vendor program and had remaining availability of approximately 25 million it is possible any ongoing or worsening deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs which would reduce our anticipated savings including but not limited to causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

stock repurchase program 

on may 15 2008 our board of directors authorized a new 250 million stock repurchase program the new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of our previous 500 million stock repurchase program authorized on august 8 2007 this program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 

during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 61 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2165 million or an average price of 3528 per share of which 46 million shares of common stock were repurchased under the previous 500 million stock repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 after may 15 2008 we repurchased 15 million shares of common stock for 611 million leaving 1889 million remaining under our current 250 million stock repurchase program excluding related expenses additionally during fiscal 2008 we settled 30 million on shares repurchased prior to the end of fiscal 2007 

 

cash dividend 

 

on february 15 2006 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend the first in our history we have paid quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record for each of our subsequent quarters subsequent to january 3 2009 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 10 2009 to all common stockholders of record as of march 27 2009

contractual obligations 

in addition to our revolving credit facility we utilize operating leases as another source of financing the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations at january 3 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long term debt 

term loan 

we entered into a 200 million unsecured fouryear term loan on december 4 2007 with our whollyowned subsidiary advance stores company incorporated or stores serving as borrower as of january 3 2009 we had borrowed 200 million under this term loan as compared to borrowings of 50 million as of december 29 2007 the entire 200 million of proceeds from this term loan were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program the term loan terminates on october 5 2011 voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the term loan balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the term loan 

the interest rate on the term loan is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 100 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively we have elected to use the 90day adjusted libor rate and have the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings under the terms of the term loan the interest rate is based on our credit rating 

revolving credit facility 

in addition to the term loan we have a 750 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with stores serving as the borrower the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of 300 million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 50 million we may request subject to agreement by one or more lenders that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 250 million up to a total commitment of 1 billion during the term of the credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility terminates on october 5 2011 

as of january 3   2009   we   had   2515 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding of 1013 million which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to 3972 million the letters of credit serve as collateral for our selfinsurance policies and routine purchase of imported merchandise a commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the revolver payable in arrears the current commitment fee rate is 0150 per annum 

the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 075 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively we have elected to use   the   90  day   adjusted   libor 

 

 

rate and have the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings under the terms of the revolving credit facility the interest rate and commitment fee is based on our credit rating 

other 

 

as of january 3 2009 we had 40 million outstanding under an economic development note and 07 million outstanding under other financing arrangements at january 3 2009 we had interest rate swaps in place that effectively fixed our interest rate on approximately 60 of our longterm debt 

 

guarantees and covenants 

 

the term loan and revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by advance auto parts inc our debt agreements collectively contain covenants restricting our ability to among other things 1 create incur or assume additional debt including hedging arrangements 2 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 3 make loans and investments 4 guarantee obligations 5 engage in certain mergers acquisitions and asset sales 6 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and 7 change our status as a holding company we are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio we were in compliance with these covenants at january 3 2009 our term loan and revolving credit facilit y also provide for customary events of default covenant defaults and crossdefaults to our other material indebtedness

credit ratings 

at january 3 2009 we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bb and a credit rating of ba1 from moody’s investor service unchanged from december 29 2007 the current outlook of standard  poor’s and moody’s is negative and stable respectively but does not affect our current credit ratings the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our term loan and revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest expense may increase conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest expense may decrease if our credit ratings decline our access to financing may become more limited 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2008 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb staff position or fsp eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” fsp eitf 0361 addresses whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the twoclass method as described in statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 128 “earnings per share” under   the guidance of fsp eitf 0361 nonvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earningspershare pursuant to the twoclass method fsp eitf 0361 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and all priorperiod earnings per share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively early application is not permitted we do not anticipate the adoption of fsp eitf 0361 will have an impact on our earnings per share 

in june 2008 the fasb issued eitf no 083 “accounting by lessees for nonrefundable maintenance deposits” eitf 083 requires that nonrefundable maintenance deposits paid by a lessee under an arrangement accounted for as a lease be accounted for as a deposit asset until the underlying maintenance is performed when the underlying maintenance is performed the deposit may be expensed or capitalized in accordance with the lessee’s maintenance accounting policy upon adoption entities must recognize the effect of the change as a change in accounting principle eitf 083 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we do not expect the adoption of eitf 083 to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension 

 

 

assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the fsp requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement consistent with its expected use of the asset and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas 141 “business combinations” the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date the fsp is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 133” sfas no 161 is intended to improve financial standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys financial position financial performance and cash flows entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 161 will have on our consolidated financial statements

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” fsp no fas 1571 amends sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” to exclude sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under sfas no 13 however this scope exception does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that are required to be measured at fair value under sfas no 141 or sfas no 141r business combinations revised 2007 regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to leases the fsp will be effective upon the full adoption of sfas 157 during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and will not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” which replaces sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r among other things establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any controlling interests in the acquired entity recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination costs of the acquisition will be recognized separately from the business combination sfas no 141r applies to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we will consider this standard when evaluating potential future transactions to which it would apply 

effective december 30 2007 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” on our financial assets and liabilities subject to the deferral provisions of fsp1572 sfas no 157 clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for defining fair value as it relates to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and expands the disclosures of fair value measurements we did not apply the provisions of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis at least annually as allowed by the issuance of fsp no 1572 the deferral provided by fsp no 1572 applies to such items as i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods and ii nonfinancial longlived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment we are evaluating the impact fsp no 1572 will have on our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value and are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis the adoption of sfas 157 did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we will fully adopt sfas 157 effective during our first quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

 

effective december 30 2007 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value we elected not to apply fair value on our existing financial assets and liabilities upon adoption therefore this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm bank debt as a result of the movements in libor our longterm bank debt consists of borrowings under a revolving credit facility and a term loan while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our bank debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities 

 

our future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of our entering into an interest rate swap in fiscal 2007 on an aggregate of 50 million of debt under our term loan and four interest rate swap agreements in fiscal 2006 on an aggregate of 225 million of debt under our revolving credit facility the interest rate swaps entered into during 2006 replaced the previously outstanding swaps terminated as a result of our r efinancing in october 2006 

at january 3 2009 our outstanding swaps fixed the company’s libor rate on an aggregate of 275 million of hedged debt at interest rates ranging from 401 to 498 all of the swaps expire in october 2011 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm bank debt outstanding at january 3 2009 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes i the notional amounts of our hedged debt and ii the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 3 2009 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

our 3153 aap stores were located in the following states and territories at december 29 2007 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our aap stores during the past five years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

store technology   our storebased information systems which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of a proprietary pointofsale or pos system and electronic parts catalog or epc system information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system that enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year make model and engine type of their vehicles our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalog and deliver updated accurate product information 

our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and userfriendly navigation tools that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our stores the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our pdq Ò system available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store law pdq Ò or master pdq Ò with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time

store support center 

merchandising   purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our centralized corporate offices in roanoke virginia or store support center in 2007 we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 7 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with certain vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume 

our merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a category management process we believe this process which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category has been highly effective and is critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch ®  castrol ®  sylvania ®  prestone ®  monroe ®  bendix ®  purolator ®  dayco ® and trico ®  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and washandwax products to tools batteries parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of professional’s favorite tm  joe’s garage tm  mechanic’s choice tm  auto xpress tm  autocraft tm  endurance tm  wearever tm  jobmate tm and mirage tm  

supply chain   our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system or e3 to monitor the distribution center pdq ® warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that product e3 utilizes the most uptodate information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history sales trends by sku seasonality and demographic shifts in demand e3 

 

 

combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange with the remainder being sent by computer generated email or facsimile 

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times decreased third party freight and billing service costs decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store instock position 

we currently operate eight distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “pickto light” systems robotic picking radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of 3400 stores during 2007 we announced our plan to build a new distribution center in indiana now scheduled to open in early2010 

we currently offer approximately 58000 skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our 13 standalone pdq ® warehouses andor our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq ® items stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities or as an alternative through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq ® trucking fleet and third party carriers store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers in addition we operate a master pdq ® warehouse that stocks 45000 incremental skus of hardertofind automotive parts and accessories and utilizes our existing pdq ® distribution infrastructure andor third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 

advertising   we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings parts assortment and availability competitive prices free services and commitment to customer service the program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the resource for a customers automotive needs we use a mix of media that reinforces our brand image including television radio promotional signage outdoor media print and our internet site 

our advertising plan is a brandbuilding program built around television and radio advertising the plan is supported by instore signage online advertising and print our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming radio advertising generally airs during peak drive times we use spanishlanguage radio and television advertising to market to our hispanic customers our advertising program is also supported through sponsorships of sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots effort to positively impact individual communities including hispanic and other ethnic communities to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores since 2004 we have used an integrated consumer education program to build our image as not only the source for parts but also the best resource for vehicle information our goal with this initiative is to continue our longterm brand building success increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 

in february 2008 we launched a new branding campaign “keep the wheels turning” this campaign was developed based on a strategic review of our business as well as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members we believe this campaign which targets both diy and difm customers will differentiate advance auto parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand name parts and products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers keep their vehicles running the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance auto parts 

ai segment 

we acquired ai in september 2005 the acquisition which included 61 stores throughout new england and new york a distribution center and ai’s wholesale distribution business complements our growing presence in the difm market in the northeast 

ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ai’s product is sold under its proprietary brand the ai stores offer an average of 9500 skus with access to an additional 17000 unique skus through its logistics network 

at december 29 2007 we operated 108 stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states throughout the northeast 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 

 

 

 

 

 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

at february 22 2008 we employed 25499 fulltime team members and 18566 parttime team members our workforce consisted of 88 of our team members employed in storelevel operations 9 employed in distribution and 3 employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements we believe that our team member relations are good 

 

intellectual property 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “western auto” “parts america” “autopart international” and “pdq” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our proprietary products we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

competition 

we operate in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc csk auto corporation and the pep boys–manny moe  jack ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal methods of competition in our business include store location availability customer service and product offerings quality and price 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of leadacid batteries and used oil and ownership and operation of real property we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business in addition our customers may bring leadacid batteries or used oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive leadacid batteries and used oil at all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal the terms of our contracts with the third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations persons who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 




 item 1a  risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy 

 

 

 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have increased our store count significantly from 814 stores at the end of 1997 to 3261 stores at december 29 2007 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores we may not assure you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

 

 

 

we may not assure you that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances then our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for any number of reasons including 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members at february 25 2008 we employed 44065 team members we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including location price name recognition and customer service we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry and primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition or larger and more established customer bases our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal control or increase our promotional spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

 

 

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate matters and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection product quality standards and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

risks relating to our financial condition 

the covenants governing our revolving and term loan facilities impose restrictions on us 

the terms of our revolving and term loan facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our credit facilities furthermore our credit facilities contain certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our credit facilities any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us

introduction 

we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy and “doitforme” or difm customers in the united states based on store count and sales at december 29 2007 we operated 3261 stores throughout 40 states 

we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” and “western auto” at december 29 2007 we operated 3153 stores in the aap segment of which 3123 stores operated under the trade names “advance auto parts” and “advance discount auto parts” throughout 40 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores offer automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items in addition we operated 30 stores under the “western auto” and “advance auto parts” trade names located in puerto rico and the virgin islands or offshore 

at december 29 2007 we operated 108 stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name we acquired ai in september 2005 and ai operates as an independent whollyowned subsidiary ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we lease approximately 81 of our stores

key financial metrics 

the following table highlights certain consolidated operating results and key financial metrics for 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management overview 

we recorded earnings per diluted share of 228 in fiscal 2007 compared to 216 for fiscal 2006 we continue to generate significant operating cash flow to allow us to invest in business initiatives and return capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases we remain focused on increasing our sales operating margins and return on invested capital and believe certain strategic initiatives introduced during 2007 are beginning to propel us toward achieving these goals specific updates on these initiatives among other recent developments during 2007 are discussed below 

new ceo – we announced in november 2007 the appointment of a new ceo and president darren jackson which became effective in january 2008 mr jackson who previously served on our audit committee finance committee and board of directors had already been involved with management on the completion of certain strategic studies during 2007 and the formulation of certain initiatives discussed below 

sales initiatives – we believe our biggest opportunity is increasing our top line sales growth as we develop initiatives around a more customerfocused strategy and increased parts availability and related knowledge by the team members in our stores our sales per square foot and sales per employee are currently in the bottom half of the automotive aftermarket industry in 2007 we began implementing our plan to increase diy and difm sales through improving parts availability with an emphasis on late model and foreign vehicles our enhanced parts availability will be funded partially from available working capital as we transition from other less productive inventory 

we believe our difm business has started to improve as indicated by an 82 comparable store sales increase during the fourth quarter although we continue to face a challenging macroeconomic environment including higher fuel and credit costs faced by our customers higher unemployment and lower consumer confidence in order to structure our difm business for further growth we continue to examine store staffing and training compensation policies and truck utilization commercial sales represented approximately 27 of our total sales for fiscal 2007 as compared to approximately 25 for fiscal 2006 at december 29 2007 we operated commercial programs in 83 of our total aap stores compared to 81 for the prior fiscal year lastly we began improving the productivity and efficiency of our sales floor in our stores by aligning functions performed by our sales associates with our increased parts focus including the transition of less productive inventory 

sga structure – we took significant steps towards reducing and reallocating our selling general and administrative expense structure during the second half of 2007 we eliminated 250 positions at our store support center and other field support areas and terminated our advance tv network which together resulted in 63 million of expense recognized in our 2007 operating results additionally we reduced our real estate development by opening fewer new stores relocating fewer stores and halting the 2010 store remodel program during the fourth quarter of 2007 we introduced a 6000 square foot prototype store we believe this smaller model can support an adequate level of parts availability for both our diy and difm customers while reducing our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales 

lastly we completed the further reduction and reallocation of certain advertising expenditures into a more focused effort in electronic media we have recently introduced a new brand “keep the wheels turning” this campaign was developed as part of our overall strategic review of the business as well as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members we believe this campaign which targets both diy and difm customers differentiates advance auto parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand name parts and products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers keep their vehicles running the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance auto parts due to the reallocation of our advertising expenditures we expect 2008 advertising expense to remain generally consistent with 2007 levels 

return on invested capital improvements – we eliminated certain information technology logistics and other investments that did not demonstrate acceptable returns during the second half of 2007 we halted our store remodel program while we more closely examine the sales results and overall return from these remodels   additionally we have delayed the opening of our ninth distribution center to the beginning of 2010 as a result of fewer new store openings planned throughout 2008 

 

 

stock repurchase program –   during 2007 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to 500 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program which became effective august 8 2007 replaced the remaining portion of a 300 million stock repurchase program during 2007 we repurchased 83 million shares of common stock for 286 million refer to further discussion of this program in the liquidity section of this management’s discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs including cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional incentives we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” many of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink as an increase to our cost of sales for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves if estimates regarding our cycle counting program are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

 

we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and current market conditions the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded 

 

 

cost if any required by market conditions our total inventory reserves increased by 42 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as the result of an increase in our total shrinkage as a percentage of sales 

future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 29 2007 would have affected net income by approximately 22 million 

warranty reserves 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims we are responsible for merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations our warranty reserves increased by 47 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to an increase in our defective return rate as well as an increase in the sale of premium batteries a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 29 2007 would have affected net income by approximately 11 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 

selfinsured reserves 

 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure our selfinsurance program started in 2001 has not reached full maturity a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience each year our reserve for selfinsurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved generally claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year our selfinsurance reserves increased by 140 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of workers’ compensation claims and automobile accident claims as well as an increase in the total cost to settle workers’ compensation claims as compared to the prior year the increase in the number of claims is driven by overall growth including an increase in total number of stores employees and commercial delivery vehicles 

while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding selling general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 29 2007 would have affected net income by approximately 53 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

the accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” or fin 48 on december 31 2006 refer to note 12 for further discussion of the impact of adopting fin 48 and change in reserves during fiscal 2007 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record reserves for potential exposures these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations and the evolution of tax code and 

 

regulations along with varying application of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution a 10 change in the tax reserves at december 29 2007 would have affected net income by approximately 14 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening we exclude from comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores 

cost of sales 

 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs vendor programs inventory shrinkage defective and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution costs we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements without minimum purchase volume requirements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs see note 2 in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent advertising expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members sharebased compensation expense store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses and other related expenses 

 

 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 

  fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

 

net sales for 2007 were 48444 million an increase of 2279 million or 49 over net sales for 2006 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 08 and contributions from the 196 aap and ai stores opened within the last year the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our difm business and an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count we expect to experience similar trends into 2008 as we start to experience benefits from our sales and advertising initiatives combined with the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment ai produced sales of 1350 million in 2007 an increase 239 million or 216 compared to 2006 ai’s sales increase was driven primarily by our acceleration of newstore growth through 2006 and 2007 

gross profit for 2007 was 23210 million or 479 of net sales as compared to 22012 million or 477 of net sales in 2006 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved procurement costs and a positive shift in sales mix lower logistics expense partially offset by strategic price changes associated with our focused effort on remaining competitive in the parts category 

selling general and administrative expenses were 19045 million or 393 of net sales for 2007 as compared to 17978 million or 390 of net sales for 2006 selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of an increase in certain fixed occupancy costs as a result of lower than anticipated sales growth partially offset by reduced advertising expense 

operating income for 2007 was 4164 million or 86 of net sales as compared to 4034 million or 87 of net sales in 2006 this decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was reflective of higher selling general and administrative expenses as previously discussed partially offset by an increase in gross profit aap produced operating income of 4172 million or 89 of net sales for 2007 as compared to 4023 million or 89 of net sales in 2006 ai generated an operating loss for 2007 of 08 million as compared to operating income of 11 million in 2006 this decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower than anticipated sales additional expenses associated with the transition to ai’s new distribution center early in 2007 and the reinvestment of resources to accelerate ai’s store growth and roll out of certain ai branded product 

interest expense for 2007 was 348 million or 07 of net sales as compared to 360 million or 08 of net sales in 2006 the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

 

income tax expense for 2007 was 1443 million as compared to 1386 million for 2006 our effective income tax rate was 377 and 375 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we generated net income of 2383 million or 228 per diluted share for 2007 as compared to 2313 million or 216 per diluted share for 2006 as a percentage of sales net income for 2007 was 49 as compared to 50 for 2006 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

net sales for 2006 were 46165 million an increase of 3515 million or 82 over net sales for 2005 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 21 contributions from the 190 aap stores opened within the last year and sales from ai ai which was acquired in september 2005 produced sales of 1111 million in 2006 compared to 303 million for the partial period in 2005 the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our difm business and an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count 

gross profit for 2006 was 22012 million or 477 of net sales as compared to 20145 million or 472 of net sales in 2005 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects the positive impact of our ongoing category management initiatives including improved procurement costs and a positive shift in sales mix and logistics efficiencies 

 

selling general and administrative expenses were 17978 million or 390 of net sales for 2006 as compared to 16060 million or 376 of net sales for 2005 selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales as a result of 

 

 

 

additionally ai contributed approximately 02 of selling general and administrative expenses as a result of the reinvestment of working capital to accelerate their new store growth 

interest expense for 2006 was 360 million or 08 of net sales as compared to 324 million or 07 of net sales in 2005 the increase in interest expense is a result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2005 in addition other income for fiscal 2006 decreased as a result of less interest income associated with lower cash balances throughout the year 

income tax expense for 2006 was 1386 million as compared to 1442 million for 2005 our effective income tax rate was 375 and 381 for 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we generated net income of 2313 million or 216 per diluted share for 2006 as compared to 2347 million or 213 per diluted share for 2005 as a percentage of sales net income for 2006 was 50 as compared to 55 for 2005 our earnings per diluted share results reflect the impact on both earnings and the diluted share count of implementing fas 123r as further explained in this management’s discussion and analysis and in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands except per share data 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory capital expenditures payment of quarterly cash dividends and contractual obligations in addition we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to repay borrowings under our credit facility we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

 

at december 29 2007 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 147 million an increase of 35 million compared to fiscal yearend 2006 this increase resulted from an increase in cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the continued investment in property and equipment reduction in our revolving credit facility balance and return of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and repurchase of common stock during 2007 at december 29 2007 our outstanding indebtedness was 284 million higher when compared to 2006 and consisted of borrowings of 4510 million under our revolving credit facility 500 million under our term loan and 47 million outstanding on an economic development note additionally we had 747 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility to 2243 million 

on february 15 2006 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend the first in our history we have paid quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record for each of our quarters during 2006 and 2007 subsequent to december 29 2007 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 4 2008 to all common stockholders of record as of march 21 2008 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels maintenance of existing stores the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development of proprietary information systems implementation of proprietary and purchased information systems and our acquisitions our capital expenditures were 2106 million in 2007 during fiscal 2007 we opened 175 aap and 21 ai stores remodeled 77 aap stores and relocated 29 aap stores 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of stores we relocate or remodel during 2008 we anticipate adding 100 new aap and 15 ai stores and relocating 10 to 20 aap stores we do not plan to remodel any stores in 2008 we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and logistics network as well as investing in new information systems to support certain initiatives including our parts availability initiative in 2008 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 1700 million to 1900 million 

 

 

vendor financing program 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms we have a shortterm financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases in substance the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth our revolving and term loan facilities do not restrict availability under this program at december 29 2007 1535 million was payable to the bank by us under this program 

stock repurchase program 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to 500 million of our common stock plus related expenses the new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of the previous 300 million stock repurchase program the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 

during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 83 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2859 million or an average price of 3427 per share of which 13 million shares of common stock were repurchased under the previous 300 million stock repurchase program as of december 29 2007 30 million of shares have been repurchased and remained unsettled subsequent to december 29 2007 we repurchased 46 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1554 million or an average price of 3404 per share reflective of the subsequent repurchases we have remaining 1052 million under our current stock repurchase program

long term debt 

on december 4 2007 we entered into a new 2000 million unsecured fouryear term loan with our subsidiary advance stores company incorporated or stores serving as borrower proceeds from this term loan will be used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program as of december 29 2007 stores had borrowed 500 million under the term loan subsequent to december 29 2007 stores borrowed the remaining capacity under the term loan voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the term loan balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the new term loan 

in addition to the term loan we have in place a 7500 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with stores serving as the borrower this facility was entered into in october 2006 and replaced our term loans and revolver under the previous credit facility proceeds from this revolving loan facility were used to repay 4338 million of principal outstanding on our term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility in conjunction with this refinancing we wroteoff existing deferred financing costs related to our previous term loans and revolver the writeoff of these costs of 19 million was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of 29 million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 10 million during fiscal year 2006 

the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of 3000 million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 500 million we may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 2500 million during the term of the credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility 

as of december 29 2007 we had borrowed 4510 million under the revolver and had 747 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced availability under the revolver to 2243 million in addition we had outstanding 47 million under an economic development note we also maintain approximately 25 million in surety bonds issued by our insurance provider primarily to utility providers and the departments of revenue for certain states these letters of credit and surety bonds generally have a term of one year or less 

the interest rate on the term loan will be based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the initial margin is 100 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively we have elected to use the 90day adjusted libor rate and has the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on its hedged borrowings a commitment fee will be charged on the unused portion of the term loan payable in arrears the initial commitment fee rate is 0200 per annum under the terms of the term loan the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on our credit rating the term loan terminates on october 5 2011 

the interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the current margin is 075 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively we have elected to use the 90day adjusted libor rate and have the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings a commitment fee will be charged on the unused portion of the revolver payable in arrears the current commitment fee rate is 0150 per annum under the terms of the revolving credit facility the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on our credit rating the revolving facility terminates on october 5 2011 

the term loan and revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by advance auto parts inc our debt agreements collectively contain covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to among other things 1 create incur or assume additional debt including hedging arrangements 2 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 3 make loans and investments 4 guarantee obligations 5 engage in certain mergers acquisitions and asset sales 6 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and 7 change our holding company status we are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio the revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default including nonpayment defaults covenant defaults and crossdefaults to our other material indebtedness we were in compliance with these covenants at december 29 2007 

 

 

credit ratings 

at december 29 2007 we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bb and a credit rating of ba1 from moody’s investor service the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our revolving credit facility is based on such credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest expense may increase conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest expense may decrease 

recent accounting developments 

sharebased compensation 

we have sharebased compensation plans as allowed under our longterm incentive plan or ltip historically we have granted fixed stock options and deferred stock units or dsus to our employees under these plans beginning in fiscal 2007 we granted primarily stock appreciation rights or sars and restricted stock or unvested shares we continue to grant dsus to members of our board of directors and beginning in 2008 we will grant sars to our board members rather than stock options 

the terms of the sars authorized to be granted are essentially the same as our previously granted stock options the sars are nonqualified and terminate on the seventh anniversary of the grant date additionally they vest over a threeyear period in equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and contain no postvesting restrictions other than normal trading blackout periods prescribed by our corporate governance policies we continue to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to value all awards and the straightline method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 

the unvested shares vest at the end of a threeyear period during this period holders of the unvested shares are entitled to dividend and voting rights the unvested shares are restricted until they vest and cannot be sold by the recipient until the restriction has lapsed at the end of the threeyear period the fair value of unvested shares is determined based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

total sharebased compensation expense included in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 is 181 million and 191 million respectively we recognized a nominal amount of sharebased compensation during fiscal year 2005 since the adoption of sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas 123r was effective at the beginning of fiscal 2006 for a complete discussion of the adoption of sfas 123r see note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december 29 2007 we have 195 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested sharebased awards we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 18 years 

income taxes 

effective december 31 2006 we adopted the provisions of fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for income taxes recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as a result of the adoption of fin 48 on december 31 2006 we recorded an increase of 23 million to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding decrease in our balance of retained earnings for a complete discussion of the adoption of fin 48 see note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur sfas no 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a 

 

 

plan as of the date of the statement of financial position we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no 158 on december 30 2006 and recorded a reduction to the liability of 54 million and increase to other comprehensive income of 33 million net of tax see note 15 sfas no 158 is effective for the measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 sfas no 158 provides two approaches to transition to a fiscal yearend measurement date both of which are to be applied prospectively we have elected to apply the alternate transition method under which a 14month measurement will cover the period from november 1 2007 through december 29 2007 we do not expect the change in the measurement date to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt our longterm debt primarily consists of borrowings under a revolving and term loan credit facilities and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities 

our future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of entering into an interest rate swap in fiscal 2007 on an aggregate 50 million of debt under our term loan and four interest rate swap agreements in fiscal 2006 on an aggregate of 225 million of debt under our revolving credit facility the interest rate swaps entered into during 2006 replaced the previously outstanding swaps terminated as a result of our refinancing in october 2006 

at december 29 2007 our outstanding swaps fixed the company’s libor rate on an aggregate of 275 million of hedged debt at rates ranging from 401 to 498 all of the swaps expire in october 2011 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm debt outstanding at december 29 2007 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes the notional amounts of our hedged debt and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through

replacement parts sold at our stores include an extensive number of applications of those parts including

our retail stores are 100 company operated and are divided into geographic areas a senior vice president who is supported by five to six regional vice presidents manages each area of retail stores division managers report to the regional vice presidents and have direct responsibility for store operations in a specific division which typically consists of 10 to 14 stores depending on store size and sales volume each store is staffed by 10 to 20 team members under the leadership of a store manager our stores generally are open from 730 am to 900 pm six days a week and 900 am to 900 pm on sundays and most holidays to meet the needs of our diy and difm customers we continue to increase the number of our stores which remain open until midnight or in some cases 24 hours per day

our 2995 aap stores were located in the following states and territories at december 30 2006 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our aap stores during the past five years 

 

 

 

    

store systems 

our store based information systems which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of proprietary pointofsale or pos electronic parts catalog or epc storelevel inventory management and standard operating procedure or sop systems additionally we support our storelevel operations with a proprietary labor scheduling system known as management planning and training or mpt these systems are tightly integrated and together provide realtime comprehensive information to store and merchandising personnel resulting in improved customer service levels team member productivity and instock availability 

 

pointofsale  our pos system or apal is in all of our stores operating under the “advance auto parts” advance discount auto parts” and “western auto” trade names information maintained by apal is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly apal is designed to improve customer checkout time and decrease the time required to train newly hired team members in addition apal provides additional customer purchase history which may be used for customer demographic analysis 

electronic parts catalog  our enhanced epc system which is fully integrated with apal is a software system that enables our store team members to identify millions of application uses for automotive parts and accessories the epc system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year make model and engine type of their vehicles our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalog and deliver updated accurate product information if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our stores the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our pdq Ò system available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store law pdq Ò or master pdq Ò with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time 

our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and userfriendly navigation tools that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project while we believe this generally leads to an increase in average sales per transaction we believe these components will enhance our customers’ shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair job the first time saving them time and money additionally information about a customers automobile can be entered into a permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits or telephones one of our stores 

storelevel inventory management system  our storelevel inventory management system provides realtime inventory tracking at the store level with the storelevel system store team members can check the quantity of onhand inventory for any sku adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers our   stores use 

 

 

radio frequency handheld devices to help ensure the accuracy of our inventory 

 

standard operating procedures our sop system is a webbased electronic data management system that allows our team members instant and quick access to any of our standard operating procedures through a comprehensive online search function 

store support center 

merchandising 

 

virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by team members at our centralized store support center in roanoke virginia in 2006 we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 6 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating multiyear agreements with certain vendors which allows us to achieve more favorable terms and pricing 

 

our merchandising team is currently led by a group of seven senior professionals who have an average of 22 years of automotive purchasing experience and 27 years in retail the merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a highly effective category management process we believe this process which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category improves comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch ®  castrol ®  stp ®  prestone ®  monroe ®  bendix ®  purolator ®  dayco ® and trico ®  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and washandwax products to tools batteries parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of professional’s favorite tm  joe’s garage tm  mechanic’s choice tm  auto xpress tm  autocraft tm  endurance tm and wearever tm  

 

sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories we customize our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store the custom assortment is based on that stores historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific customer needs 

supply chain 

our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system or e3 to monitor the distribution center pdq ® warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that product e3 utilizes the most uptodate information from our pointofsale system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history sales trends by sku seasonality and demographic shifts in demand e3 combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange with the remainder being sent by computer generated email or facsimile 

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times decreased third party freight and billing service costs decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store instock position 

we currently operate eight distribution centers all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with 

 

 

technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “pickto light” systems robotic picking radio frequency technology voice technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of 3400 stores subsequent to december 30 2006 the company announced its plan to build a new distribution center in indiana scheduled to open in mid2008 

we currently offer over 58000 skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our 13 standalone pdq® warehouses andor our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq ® items stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities or as an alternative through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq ® trucking fleet and third party carriers store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers in addition we operate a pdq ® warehouse that stocks over 50000 incremental skus of hardertofind automotive parts and accessories this facility is known as the master pdq ®  warehouse and utilizes existing pdq ® distribution infrastructure andor third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 

advertising 

 

we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings product assortment competitive prices free services and commitment to customer service the program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the solution for a customers automotive needs we utilize a mix of media that reinforces our brand image including television radio print promotional signage and outdoor media plus our proprietary instore television network and internet site 

 

our advertising plan is a brandbuilding program built around television and radio advertising the plan is supported by print and instore signage our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming radio advertising which is used as a supplementary medium generally airs during peak drive times we also sponsor sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots effort to positively impact individual communities including hispanic and other ethnic communities to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 

since early 2003 we supported our new advertising campaign “we’re ready in advance” throughout all of our media we believe this advertising campaign differentiates advance auto parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for brand name auto parts and accessories at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance auto parts as a special place to shop 

since 2004 we have built upon the campaign through an integrated consumer education program this program is intended to build our image as not only the source for product but also the best resource for vehicle maintenance information our free brochure kiosk displaying were ready with answers and our free monthly video clinic broadcasts on advance tv our exclusive instore howto network are just two elements of this growing program we believe we will differentiate our stores from our competitors by providing our customers valuable information regarding whyto and howto perform regular maintenance on their vehicles in order to enhance their vehicles performance reliability safety and appearance our goal with this initiative is to continue our longterm brand building success increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 

ai segment 

we acquired ai in september 2005 the acquisition which included 61 stores throughout new england and new york a distribution center and ai’s wholesale distribution business complements our growing presence in the difm market in the northeast 

ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america we believe ai provides a 

 

high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery as a result of its extensive sourcing network ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts the vast majority of ai’s product is sold under it proprietary brand the ai stores offer an average of 9500 skus with access to an additional 14000 unique skus through its logistics network 

at december 30 2006 we operated 87 stores under the “autopart international” trade name in the following states throughout the northeast 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores 

 

 

 

 

 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

team members 

at february 26 2007 we employed 25489 fulltime team members and 18283 parttime team members our workforce consisted of 87  of our team members employed in storelevel operations 9  employed in distribution and 4  employed in our corporate offices we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements we believe that our team member relations are good 

we allocate substantial resources to the recruiting training and retention of team members our performance management process allows us to align each team member’s goals with our corporate strategic goals we believe this program provides us with a welltrained productive workforce that is committed to high levels of customer service and assures a qualified team to support future growth 

trade names service marks and trademarks 

we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including “advance auto parts” “western auto” “parts america” “autopart international” and “pdq” for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our proprietary products we believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 

 

competition 

our primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc csk auto corporation and the pep boysmanny moe  jack discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest independent operators and automobile dealers that supply parts we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal competitive factors that affect our business include store location availability customer service and product offerings quality and price 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants and regarding ownership and operation of real property we handle hazardous materials as part of our operations and our customers may also use hazardous materials on our properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive batteries and used lubricants at all of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors used batteries and lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal persons who arrange for the disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances 

we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances from time to time we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 

growth strategy 

our growth strategies consist of the following 

increase our average sales per store  in 2006 our average sales per aap store reached an industry leading level of 155 million per store we plan to continue increasing our average sales per store by among other things 1 improving store execution with a focus on customer service 2 execution of our category management program 3 continued maturation of our sales initiatives for our diy customers including local purchase ordering factory direct ordering salvage body parts and our custom mix store specific merchandise assortment 4 the implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program with now more than 65 of our chain remodeled and targeting a total of 150 aap stores to be remodeled annually 5 consistent growth and execution of our commercial program including optimization of delivery vehicles 6 enhanced merchandising and marketing programs and 7 focus on making our supply chain more responsive 

expand our operating margin   in addition to driving operating margin expansion through increased average sales per store and continued comparable store sales growth we will continue to focus on increasing margins by 1 improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors 2 utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity 3 controlling our operating 

 

expenses including an examination of both corporate and storelevel and 4 continuing to implement our category management and custom mix initiatives and increase direct importing including the expansion of our private label and proprietary brands in our aap stores 

increase free cash flow we have generated free cash flow over the last five years our strategy is to invest back into our business to drive further progress towards our four financial goals we look to deploy additional cash in the most optimal way to increase shareholder value which has included stock repurchases and selective acquisitions and more recently cash dividends 

 

increase return on invested capital we believe we can increase our return on invested capital by increasing our average sales per store and our margins we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth implementing a lower cost store remodel program and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets based on our experience such inmarket openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local management resources we intend to open 200 to 210 aap and ai stores primarily in existing markets in 2007 

 

industry 

the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm according to the automotive aftermarket industry association or aaia the diy category represents an approximate 35 billion market with sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves per the aaia the difm category represents an approximate 75 billion market with sales to professional installers such as independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their vehicles themselves the difm category includes an approximate 36 billion market which includes dealer purchases directly from the original equipment manufacturers 

we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will benefit from several favorable trends including the 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

risks relating to our business 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors 

 

 

could undermine our business strategy 

 

 

 

 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have increased our store count significantly from 1567 stores at the end of 1998 to 3082 stores at december 30 2006 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores there can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for any number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members at february 26  2007 we employed 43772 team members we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail to maintain such a package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including location price name recognition and customer service we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry and primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators and automobile dealers that supply parts these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition or larger and more established customer bases our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal control or increase our promotional spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

 

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination asbestos exposure real estate matters and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

 

 

 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

risks relating to our financial condition 

the covenants governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us 

the terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 

 

 

the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our revolving credit facility furthermore our revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our revolving credit facility any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us

our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants to date these products have included brake and clutch parts and roofing materials many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders we also believe that most of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and liquidity if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and liquidity in future periods

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under “forward looking statements” and risk factors elsewhere in this report 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31 of each year which results in an extra week every six years our next 53week fiscal year is 2009 our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks 

 

introduction 

we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy customers in the united states based on store count and sales at december 30 2006 we operated 3082 stores throughout 40 states 

we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts or aap and autopart international or ai the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names “advance auto parts” “discount advance auto parts” and “western auto” at december 30 2006 we operated 2995 stores in the aap segment of which 2958 stores operated under the trade names “advance auto parts” and “discount advance auto parts” throughout 40 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores offer automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items with no significant concentration in any specific product area in addition we operated 37 stores under the “western auto” and “advance auto parts” trade names located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands the western auto stores offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts accessories and maintenance items 

at december 30 2006 we operated 87 stores in the ai segment under the “autopart international” trade name we acquired ai in september 2005 and ai operates as an independent whollyowned subsidiary ai’s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations in addition its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 

the following table sets forth the total number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we lease approximately 80 of our stores 

 

 

 

 

 

   

w e anticipate adding approximately 200 to 210 aap and ai stores during 2007 

management overview 

 

w e recorded earnings per diluted share of 216 in fiscal 2006 compared to 213 for fiscal 2005 these results were primarily driven by increased sales and higher gross margin dollars offset by an increase in certain fixed operating expenses although sales did not meet our expectation for 2006 our average sales per store did reach the industry leading level of 155 million per store additionally our operating results for fiscal 2006 include the recognition of 011 of sharebased compensation expense per diluted share required by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard or sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 

 

we believe the macroeconomic environment negatively impacted our business throughout much of 2006 and resulted in weakening trends in our 2006 results compared to 2005 we believe our customers have been adversely impacted by rising energy prices higher insurance and interest rates and larger required minimum payments on their credit card balances which limit their current ability to spend 

 

we have established a high priority of examining our operating expenses including both corporate and storelevel in light of our sales trends we believe we can continue to be more efficient in our corporatelevel expenses by optimizing a number of job functions examining discretionary expenses and reevaluating all third party service providers second we continue to examine our nonsales activities in our stores and the impact of those activities on our operating expenses due to the exponential impact that small changes can have on a large chain of stores such as rolling out energymanagement systems to a significant number of our stores in addition we are evaluating a number of administrative procedures performed by our store team members in an effort to better optimize their time 

we believe our 2006 results do reflect the progress made on the following key initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per store 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally we believe the factors that favorably impact our industry continue to remain strong customers can only defer necessary maintenance on their automobiles for so long and we continue to educate customers about the value of performing certain types of maintenance and enhancements government data recently revealed that consumers are driving their automobiles more which leads to a greater need for maintenance the growing population of light trucks and sport utility vehicles are also beginning to hit the average age where we believe they will need certain repairs including overall more expensive replacement parts 

we believe the combination of these favorable industry dynamics along with the continued execution of our key business initiatives along with our more recent effort to examine operating expenses will allow us to achieve each of the following g oals 

 

 

 

the following table highlights certain consolidated operating results and key metrics for 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

key 2006 milestones 

the following key milestones occurred during 2006 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refinancing 

on october 5 2006 we entered into a new 750 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility this new facility replaced the term loans and revolver under our previous secured credit facility initial proceeds from this revolving loan were used to repay 434 million of principal outstanding on the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility as a result of the improved borrowing costs under the new facility we anticipate pretax interest expense savings of more than 25 million annually in conjunction with this refinancing we wroteoff existing deferred financing costs related to our previous term loans and revolver the writeoff of these costs of 19 million was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of 29 million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 10 million 

stock repurchase program 

during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 37 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1366 million or an average price of 3712 per share excluding related expenses our stock repurchase program as authorized by our board of directors in fiscal 2005 authorizes us to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission as of december 30 2006 we had 1040 million excluding related expenses remaining for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 

commercial program 

as indicated in the preceding operating results table our commercial program produced solid revenues in our aap stores during fiscal 2006 we attribute this performance to the execution of our commercial plan which consists of 

 

 

 

commercial sales represented approximately 25 of our consolidated total sales for the fiscal year compared to almost 22 in fiscal 2005 including ai at december 30 2006 we operated commercial programs in 82 of our stores including the 87 ai stores up from approximately 78 at the end of the prior fiscal year we continued to approach our goal of operating commercial programs in approximately 85 of our aap store base due to ai’s sole focus on the commercial business virtually all of their sales are to commercial customers 

we believe we have the opportunity to grow our commercial business for the foreseeable future through the continued execution of our commercial plan and growth in our commercial programs we believe the acquisition of ai supplements our commercial growth due to ai’s established delivery programs and knowledge of the commercial industry particularly for foreign makes and models of vehicles 

sharebased payments 

on january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 and subsequently issued stock option related guidance we elected to use the modifiedprospective method of implementation under this transition method sharebased compensation expense 

 

 

 

for fiscal year ended 2006 included compensation expense for all sharebased awards granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r and compensation expense for all sharebased awards granted prior to but unvested as of january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with original provisions of sfas no 123 

we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to value all options and straightline method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period total sharebased compensation expense included in selling general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations for the fiscal years ended 2006 was 191 million the related income tax benefit was 71 million we recognized 04 and 05 million of sharebased compensation expense in accordance with apb no 25 for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and january 1 2005 on a pro forma basis sharebased compensation was 009 and 005 per diluted share for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and january 1 2005 respectively in accordance with the modifiedprospective transition method of sfas no 123r we have not restated prior periods 

as a result of adopting sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 our earnings before income tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 were 188 million and 117 million lower respectively than if we had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb no 25 the related impact in 2006 to basic and diluted earnings per share is 011 for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 

as of december 30 2006 we have 263 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested fixed stock options we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 18 years 

ai acquisition 

the company finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of autopart international during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we acquired ai in september 2005 the acquisition which included 61 stores throughout new england and new york a distribution center and ai’s wholesale distribution business complements our growing presence in the northeast ai serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting accordingly ai’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date the total purchase price of 876 million primarily consisted of 749 million paid upon closing and an additional 125 million of contingent consideration paid in march 2006 based upon ai satisfying certain earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization targets met through december 31 2005 the completion of the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of 176 million in goodwill and 290 million of identifiable intangible assets furthermore an additional 125 million is contingently payable based upon the achievement of certain synergies through fiscal 2008 which will be reflected in the statement of operations as earned we recognized additional cost of sales of 31 million in fiscal 2006 due to such synergies 

hurricane and fire impact 

 

during the second half of fiscal 2005 hurricanes katrina rita and wilma impacted our operations throughout the states of alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas at the time these storms hit we operated approximately 750 stores throughout these states over 70 of these locations experienced some kind of physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions additionally we believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic impact of increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets immediately following these hurricanes we also incurred and recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members for scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided to our team members and their families while these sales disruptions and related incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier the insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at cost damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement cost additionally during fiscal 2005 we lost two store locations due to fire 

for fiscal 2005 we estimated and reflected in earnings 01 million of insurance recoveries net of deductibles for the fixed costs of all damage a portion of these recoveries included the settlement with our insurance carrier for the retail value of certain damaged inventory in fiscal 2006 we lost one store location due to fire and received additional recoveries as we settled additional hurricane claims for 

 

 

damaged inventory at retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement value accordingly earnings for fiscal 2006 reflected 14 million of insurance recoveries net of deductibles 

critical accounting policies 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs including cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional incentives we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” many of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink as an increase to our cost of sales for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves if estimates regarding our cycle counting program are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

 

we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and current market conditions the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost if any required by market conditions future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 difference in actual inventory reserves at december 30 2006 would have affected net income by approximately 19 million 

 

warranty reserves 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims we are responsible for merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations a 10 change in the warranty reserves at december 30 2006 would have affected net income by approximately 08 million for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 

selfinsured reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding selling general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions a 10 change in our selfinsurance liabilities at december 30 2006 would have affected net income by approximately 44 million for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 

leases and leasehold improvements 

we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes certain leases contain rent escalation clauses which are recorded on a straightline basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straightline rent recorded as a deferred rent liability lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent in addition leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 

impairment of longlived assets 

we primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware we periodically review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets recording an impairment charge if necessary when we decide to close the store or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value this determination is based on a number of factors including the store’s historical operating results and cash flows estimated future sales growth real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change in addition we regularly evaluate our computerrelated and other longlived assets and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced or has limited future value when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions these examinations include among other things auditing our filing positions the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions at any particular time multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 

in evaluating our income tax positions we record reserves for potential exposures these contingency reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change those developments could be but are not limited to settlement of tax audits expiration of the statute of limitations and the evolution of tax code and regulations along with varying application of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 

these contingency reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 

sharebased payments 

we have a sharebased compensation plan which includes fixed stock options and deferred stock units or dsus we account for our sharebased compensation plans as prescribed by the fair value provisions of sfas no 123r we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model the dsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant the optionpricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options expected stock price volatility future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of stock option forfeitures we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stockbased compensation expense however if actual results are different from these assumptions the sharebased compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the sharebased compensation in addition significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our sharebased compensation expense on future awards a 10 change in our sharebased compensation expense for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 would have affected net income by approximately 12 million for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening we exclude net sales from the 37 western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings we also exclude the net sales from the ai stores from our comparable store sales 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and consists of 52 or 53 weeks our 2004 fiscal year began on january 4 2004 and consisted of 52 weeks while our 2003 fiscal year began on december 29 2002 and consisted of 53 weeks the extra week of operations in fiscal 2003 resulted in our fiscal 2004 consisting of noncomparable calendar weeks to fiscal 2003 to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal 2004 we have compared the calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal 2003 accordingly our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal 2004 excludes week one of operations from fiscal 2003 

 

 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent advertising expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses and other related expenses 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

net sales for 2006 were 46165 million an increase of 3515 million or 82 over net sales for 2005 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 21 contributions from the 190 aap stores opened within the last year and sales from ai ai which was acquired in september 2005 produced sales of 1111 million in 2006 compared to 303 million for the partial period in 2005 the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our difm business and an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count in addition we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial plan as discussed previously in the commercial program 

gross profit for 2006 was 22012 million or 477 of net sales as compared to 20145 million or 472 of net sales in 2005 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects the positive impact of our ongoing category management initiatives including improved procurement costs and a positive shift in sales mix and logistics efficiencies 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses were 17978 million or 390 of net sales for 2006 as compared to 16060 million or 376 of net sales for 2005 selling general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales as a result of 

 

 

 

additionally ai contributed approximately 02 of selling general and administrative expenses as a result of the reinvestment of working capital to accelerate their new store growth 

interest expense for 2006 was 360 million or 08 of net sales as compared to 324 million or 07 of net sales in 2005 the increase in interest expense is a result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2005 in addition other income for fiscal 2006 decreased as a result of less interest income associated with lower cash balances throughout the year 

income tax expense for 2006 was 1386 million as compared to 1442 million for 2005 our effective income tax rate was 375 and 381 for 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we generated net income of 2313 million or 216 per diluted share for 2006 as compared to 2347 million or 213 per diluted share for 2005 as a percentage of sales net income for 2006 was 50 as compared to 55 for 2005 our earnings per diluted share results reflect the impact on both earnings and the diluted share count of implementing fas 123r as further explained in this management’s discussion and analysis and in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

net sales for 2005 were 42650 million an increase of 4947 million or 131 over net sales for 2004 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 87 contributions from the 151 new stores opened within the last year and sales from acquired operations the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and a slight increase in customer traffic 

gross profit for 2005 was 20145 million or 472 of net sales as compared to 17534 million or 465 of net sales in 2004 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management program in the form of better margins on key product categories and increased incentives under our vendor programs and supply chain efficiencies 

selling general and administrative expenses were 16060 million or 376 of net sales for 2005 as compared to 14246 million or 378 of net sales for 2004 for fiscal 2005 we experienced a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales resulting from our ability to leverage our strong comparable store sales and lower selfinsurance expense partially offset by higher fuel and energy costs 

interest expense for 2005 was 324 million or 07 of net sales as compared to 201 million or 05 of net sales in 2004 the increase in interest expense is a result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2004 

income tax expense for 2005 was 1442 million as compared to 1177 million for 2004 this increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings our effective income tax rate was 381 and 385 for 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we generated net income of 2347 million or 213 per diluted share for 2005 as compared to 1880 million or 166 per diluted share for 2004 as a percentage of sales net income for 2005 was 55 as compared to 50 for 2004

 liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory capital expenditures payment of cash dividends and contractual obligations in addition we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay quarterly cash dividends beginning in 2006 we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

at december 30 2006 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 111 million a decrease of 296 million compared to fiscal yearend 2005 our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased primarily due to the repurchase of common stock dividends paid to our shareholders and an overall net increase in working capital during 2006 as compared to 2005 at december 30 2006 we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of 4772 million under our revolving credit facility an increase of 384 million from 2005 additionally we had 668 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility to 2064 million 

on february 15 2006 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend the first in our history we paid quarterly dividends of 006 per share to stockholders of record for each of our quarters during 2006 subsequent to december 30 2006 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 006 per share to be paid on april 6 2007 to all common stockholders of record as of march 23 2007 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels inventory requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our acquisitions 

 

our capital expenditures were 2586 million in 2006 these amounts included costs related to new store openings the upgrade of our information systems and remodels and relocations of existing stores during fiscal 2006 we opened 215 aap and ai stores remodeled 189 aap stores and relocated 47 aap stores in addition we also made a 125 million contingent payment in 2006 related to the acquisition of autopart international 

 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of stores we relocate or remodel during 2007 we anticipate adding 200 to 210 new aap and ai stores remodeling 150 aap stores and relocating 35 aap stores our new aap stores if 

 

 

leased require capital expenditures of approximately 02 million per store our remodeled stores generally require capital expenditures of approximately 01 million per store which reflects a forty percent reduction from 2006 levels we believe that we can spend less in certain areas of our remodel program while continuing to benefit from an increase in sales from the remodeled stores in 2007 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2500 million to 2700 million inclusive of approximately 300 million for the construction of our new midwest distribution center scheduled to open in mid2008 

 

additionally our new aap stores require an inventory investment of approximately 02 million per store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store setup costs and training of new store team members average approximately 002 million per store and are expensed when incurred 

 

vendor financing program 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms in fiscal 2004 we entered into a shortterm financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases in substance the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth our new revolving credit facility does not restrict availability under this program at december 30 2006 1275 million was payable to the bank by us under this program 

stock repurchase program 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program replaced the remaining portion of a previous repurchase program the program allows us to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission as of december 30 2006 we had repurchased a total of 52 million shares of common stock under the program at an aggregate cost of 1960 million or an average price of 3763 per share excluding related expenses at december 30 2006 we had 1040 million excluding related expenses available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 

during fiscal 2006 we retired 51 million shares of common stock which were previously repurchased under the 300 million stock repurchase program 

during fiscal 2005 we retired 71 million shares of common stock of which 01 million shares were repurchased under the current stock repurchase plan and 70 million shares were repurchased under our previous program at an aggregate cost of 1892 million or an average price of 2691 per share excluding related expenses 

deferred compensation and postretirement plans 

we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members this plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus as determined by our retirement plan committee we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members’ deferrals to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in certain life insurance contracts accordingly the cash surrender value on these contracts is held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability at december 30 2006 the liability related to this plan was 34 million all of which is current 

we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan at december 30 2006 our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was 105 million the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paidincurred the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined the discount rate utilized at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 was 55 and 55 respectively we reserve the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these 

 

 

benefits and control costs any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense effective second quarter of 2004 we amended the postretirement plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees effective january 1 2006 due to this negative plan amendment our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by 76 million resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount the unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the 13year estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants

contractual obligations 

our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt operating leases and other contractual obligations at december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

   

long term debt 

on october 5 2006 we entered into a new 7500 million unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with our subsidiary advance stores company incorporated serving as the borrower this new facility replaced the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility proceeds from this revolving loan were used to repay 4338 million of principal outstanding on the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility in conjunction with this refinancing we wroteoff existing deferred financing costs related to our previous term loans and revolver the 19 million writeoff of these costs was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of 29 million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of 10 million 

additionally the new facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of 300 million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed 50 million we may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding 250 million during the term of the credit agreement voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part at our option in minimum principal amounts as specified in the new revolving credit facility 

as of december 30  2006 we had borrowed 4768 million under the revolver and had 668 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced availability under the revolver to 2064 million at december 30 2006 we also have interest rate swaps in place that effectively fix our interest rate exposure on approximately 50 of our debt these interest rate swaps are further discussed in our market risk analysis 

 

 

the interest rates on the borrowings under the new revolving credit facility will be based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin after an initial interest period we may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type the initial margin is 075 and 00 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively a commitment fee will be charged on the unused portion of the revolver payable in arrears the initial commitment fee rate is 0150 per annum under the terms of the new revolving credit facility the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on our credit rating the revolving credit facility terminates on october 5 2011 

the revolving credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by advance auto parts inc the facility contains covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to among other things 1 create incur or assume additional debt including hedging arrangements 2 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 3 make loans and investments 4 guarantee obligations 5 engage in certain mergers acquisitions and asset sales 6 engage in transactions with affiliates 7 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and 8 change our holding company status we are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio the new revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default including nonpayment defaults covenant defaults and crossdefaults to our other material indebtedness 

 

in 2004 we wroteoff existing deferred financing costs as a result of refinancing our outstanding term loans the writeoff of these costs combined with the related refinancing costs incurred to set up the new revolving credit facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 28 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january 1 2005 during fiscal 2004 prior to the refinancing of our credit facility we repaid 1050 million in debt prior to its scheduled maturity in conjunction with these partial repayments we wroteoff deferred financing costs in the amount of 04 million which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january 1 2005 

we are required to comply with financial covenants in the revolving credit facility with respect to a a maximum leverage ratio and b a minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with the above covenants under the revolving credit facility at december 30 2006 

credit ratings 

at december 30 2006 we had a credit rating from standard  poor’s of bb and a credit rating of ba1 from moody’s investor service the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our revolving credit facility is based on such credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest expense may increase conversely if these credit ratings improve our interest expense may decrease

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt our longterm debt currently consists of borrowings under a revolving credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities at december 30 2006 approximately 225 million of our bank debt was fixed in accordance with the interest rate swaps described below 

our future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of entering into four new interest rate swap agreements in october 2006 on an aggregate of 225 million of debt under our revolving credit facility these interest rate swaps replaced the previously outstanding swaps settled as a result of our refinancing in october 2006 

 

the first swap fixed our libor rate at 49675 on 75 million of debt for a term of 60 months expiring in october 2011 the second swap fixed our libor rate at 49680 on 50 million of debt for a term of 60 months expiring in october 2011 the third swap fixed our libor rate at 49800 on 50 million of debt for a term of 60 months expiring in october 2011 the fourth swap fixed our libor rate at 49650 on 50 million of debt for a term of 60 months expiring in october 2011 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm debt outstanding at december 30 2006 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes the notional amounts of our hedged debt and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december 30 2006 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

generate strong free cash flow we have generated strong free cash flow over the last five years our strategy is to invest back into our business through our key initiatives for increasing sales per store and operating margins we look to deploy additional cash in the most optimal way to increase shareholder value which has included stock repurchases and acquisitions and as recently announced the opportunity for cash dividends 

increase return on invested capital we believe we can successfully continue to increase our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth and increasing our margins we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets based on our experience such inmarket openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local management resources we intend to open at least 170 to 180 aap stores primarily in existing markets in 2006 

industry 

the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm according to the automotive aftermarket industry association or aaia ®  aftermarket factbook from 2000 to 2004 the diy category grew at a 45 compound annual growth rate from 289 billion to 345 billion this category represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves we believe this category is characterized by stable more recessionresistant demand than most retailers because of the needbased characteristics of the diy category additionally in difficult economic times we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less we also believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer which moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed alternatively in an improving economy we believe the needbased characteristics of our diy customers still exist and they are more inclined to complete preventative maintenance than to defer these activities from 2000 to 2004 the difm category grew at a 5 compound annual growth rate from 622 billion to 755 billion according to the aaia aftermarket factbook this category represents sales to professional installers such as independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their own vehicles 

we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from several favorable trends including the 

 

 

we believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the industry

merchandising 

virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel at our corporate offices or store support center in roanoke virginia in 2005 we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 6 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating multiyear agreements with certain vendors which allows us to achieve more favorable terms and pricing 

our merchandising team is currently led by a group of seven senior professionals who have an average of 17 years of automotive purchasing experience and over 24 years in retail the merchandising team is skilled in sourcing products globally and maintaining high quality levels the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a highly effective category management process we believe this process which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category improves comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as castrol ®  stp ®  monroe ®  bendix ®  purolator ® and trico ®  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories we customize our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store the custom assortment is based on that stores historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific customer needs 

supply chain 

our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers pdq ® warehouses and stores our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system e3 trim to monitor the distribution center pdq ® warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that product the system provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history sales trends by sku seasonality and demographic shifts in demand e3 trim combines these factors with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange with the remainder being sent by computer generated email or facsimile 

table of contents 

our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times decreased third party freight and billing service costs decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store instock position 

we currently operate eight distribution centers our most recently opened pennsylvania facility began servicing our expanding store base in the northeast in april 2005 all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “pickto light” systems robotic picking radio frequency technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of 3800 stores 

we currently offer over 40000 skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our 16 standalone pdq® warehouses andor our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq ® items stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities or as an alternative through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq ® trucking fleet and partner carriers in addition we operate a pdq ® warehouse that stocks approximately 60000 skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories this facility is known as the master pdq ®  warehouse and utilizes existing pdq ® distribution infrastructure andor third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores

our advertising plan is a brandbuilding program built around television and radio advertising the plan is supported by print and instore signage our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming radio advertising which is used as a supplementary medium generally airs during peak drive times we also sponsor sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots effort to positively impact individual communities including hispanic and other ethnic communities to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 

since early 2003 we supported our new advertising campaign “we’re ready in advance” throughout all of our media we believe this advertising campaign differentiates advance auto parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance auto parts as a special place to shop

competition 

our primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc csk auto corporation and the pep boysmanny moe  jack wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations such as napa and carquest independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal competitive factors that affect our business include availability store location customer service and product offerings quality and price 

environmental matters 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants and regarding ownership and operation of real property we handle hazardous materials as part of our operations and our customers may also use hazardous materials on our properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive batteries and used lubricants at all of our stores as a service to our customers under agreements with third party vendors pursuant to these agreements used batteries and lubricants are collected by our team members deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal persons who arrange for the disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy 

 

 

 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 

we have increased our store count significantly from 1567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2872 stores at december 31 2005 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores there can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 

 

 

 

table of contents 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts 

 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons including 

 

 

 

if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members   

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members at march 6 2006 we employed 42427 team members we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail to maintain such an adequate compensation and benefits package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including price name recognition customer service and location we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry and primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition or larger and more established customer bases our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of 

 

table of contents 

our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions in particular we are currently involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination asbestos exposure and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

risks relating to our financial condition 

the covenants governing our senior credit facility impose significant restrictions on us 

the terms of our senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 

 

the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior credit facility furthermore our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us 

our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 

 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability to generate cash depends on our 

 

table of contents 

successful financial and operating performance we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations our financial and operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 

 

 

if we are unable to service our debt we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital however we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate also some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies including foreclosing on our assets under those circumstances our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments

management overview 

in 2005 we produced solid earnings primarily reflective of our continued sales momentum and gross margin improvements these results helped us generate strong cash flow and drive a higher return on our invested capital our strong sales were primarily driven by an 87 increase in comparable store net sales for the year our highest comparative sales increase as a public company additionally our average net sales per store rose to more than 15 million which is one of the highest among our major competitors 

we remain focused on the following four goals 

1 rasing average sales per store 

2 expancing operating margins 

3 generating strong free cash flow and 

4 increasing return on invested capital 

we believe our 2005 results also reflect the progress made on the following key initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per store and leveraging our fixed expenses

beyond the implementation of our key business initiatives various conditions that impact our industry continue to remain strong the number of registered vehicles on the road is at an all time high and continues to increase the average age of vehicles also continues to increase and is now over nine years old additionally technological changes in newer models and the shift from cars to light trucks and sport utility vehicles have resulted in more expensive replacement parts for these vehicles we believe the combination of our execution on key business initiatives and favorable industry dynamics will continue to drive our earnings per share growth into the foreseeable future

stock repurchase program 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to 300 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program which became effective august 15 2005 replaced the remaining portion of a 200 million stock repurchase program that had been authorized by our board of directors during third quarter of fiscal 2004 the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission

hurricane and fire impact 

 

during the second half of fiscal 2005 hurricanes katrina rita and wilma impacted our operations throughout the states of alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas at the time these storms hit we operated approximately 750 stores throughout these states over 70 of these locations experienced some kind of physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions additionally we believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic impact of increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets immediately following these hurricanes we also incurred and recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members for scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided to our team members and their families while these sales disruptions and related incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier the insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at cost damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement cost additionally during fiscal 2005 we lost two store locations due to fire 

for the year ended december 31 2005 we estimated and reflected in earnings the fixed costs of all damage offset by the realizable insurance recoveries net of deductibles accordingly earnings for 2005 reflect the recovery of substantially all of these fixed costs a portion of these recoveries includes the settlement with our insurance carrier for the retail value of certain damaged inventory moreover we may receive additional recoveries beyond our recorded receivable as we settle additional claims for damaged inventory at retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement value

commercial program 

as indicated in the operating results table above our commercial program produced strong revenues during fiscal 2005 we attribute this performance to the execution of our commercial plan which consists of 

 

 

 

commercial sales represented approximately 22 of our consolidated total sales for the fiscal year compared to almost 18 in fiscal 2004 at december 31 2005 we operated commercial programs in 78 of our stores including the 62 ai stores up from approximately 73 at the end of the prior fiscal year we anticipate growing our number of commercial programs to approximately 85 of our total store base over time we believe we have the potential to grow profitably our share of the commercial business in each of our markets 

we believe the continued execution of our commercial plan and growth in our commercial programs will result in doubledigit comparable store net sales growth in our commercial business for the foreseeable future we believe the acquisition of ai will supplement our commercial growth due to ai’s established delivery programs and knowledge of the commercial industry particularly for foreign makes and models of vehicles 

discontinued operations 

prior to 2004 we operated a wholesale distribution segment under the trade name “western auto” on december 19 2003 we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network the wholesale distribution network or wholesale consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of 24 million for fiscal year 2003 represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january 3 2004 to reflect this decision for the fiscal year ended january 1 2005 the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal 2003 

critical accounting policies 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional considerations we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” many of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis certain vendors require us to use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising we define these allowances as 

 

table of contents 

 

restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

we recognize other promotional incentives earned under longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same shortterm incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink as an increase to our cost of sales for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 

 

we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost if any required by market conditions future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

warranty reserves 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims we are responsible for merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

selfinsured reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which we calculate using analyses of historical data demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by thirdparty actuaries management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding selling general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions

leases and leasehold improvements 

we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes certain leases contain rent escalation clauses which are recorded on a straightline basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straightline rent recorded as a deferred rent liability lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent in addition leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 

closed store liabilities 

we recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased store location the reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs for common area maintenance and taxes offset by the present value of management’s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts these estimates are based on current market conditions and our experience of obtaining subleases or buyouts on similar properties however our inability to enter into subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling general and administrative expenses as well as our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows 

impairment of longlived assets 

we primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware we periodically review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets recording an impairment charge if necessary when we decide to close the store or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value this determination is based on a number of factors including the store’s historical operating results and cash flows estimated future sales growth real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change in addition we regularly evaluate our computerrelated and other longlived assets and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced or has limited future value when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period 

tax reserves 

the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the code regulations pronouncements and applicable case law of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business applying these complex rules requires significant judgment we believe our tax positions are fully supportable but we establish reserves for certain positions which may be successfully challenged these reserves are adjusted on a facts and circumstances basis as challenges are resolved or the relevant tax guidance evolves 

 

 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods we 

 

table of contents 

 

include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening we exclude net sales from the 36 western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings we also plan to exclude the net sales from the ai stores from our comparable store sales 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and consists of 52 or 53 weeks our 2004 fiscal year began on january 4 2004 and consisted of 52 weeks while our 2003 fiscal year began on december 29 2002 and consisted of 53 weeks the extra week of operations in fiscal 2003 resulted in our fiscal 2004 consisting of noncomparable calendar weeks to fiscal 2003 to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal 2004 we have compared the calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal 2003 accordingly our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal 2004 excludes week one of operations from fiscal 2003 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent advertising expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members store support center administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses and other related expenses 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 

 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

net sales for 2005 were 42650 million an increase of 4947 million or 131 over net sales for 2004 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 87 contributions from the 151 new stores opened within the last year and sales from acquired operations the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and a slight increase in customer traffic we believe these results reflect the 

 

table of contents 

 

execution of the key business initiatives discussed previously in the management overview in addition we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial plan as discussed previously in the commercial program 

gross profit for 2005 was 20145 million or 472 of net sales as compared to 17534 million or 465 of net sales in 2004 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management program in the form of better margins on key product categories and increased incentives under our vendor programs and supply chain efficiencies 

selling general and administrative expenses were 16060 million or 376 of net sales for 2005 as compared to 14246 million or 378 of net sales for 2004 for fiscal 2005 we experienced a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales resulting from our ability to leverage our strong comparable store sales and lower selfinsurance expense partially offset by higher fuel and energy costs 

interest expense for 2005 was 324 million or 07 of net sales as compared to 201 million or 05 of net sales in 2004 the increase in interest expense is a result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates as compared to fiscal 2004 

income tax expense for 2005 was 1442 million as compared to 1177 million for 2004 this increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings our effective income tax rate was 381 and 385 for 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we recorded net income of 2347 million or 213 per diluted share for 2005 as compared to 1880 million or 166 per diluted share for 2004 as a percentage of sales net income for 2005 was 55 as compared to 50 for 2004 the earnings per share results reflect the effect of a threefortwo stock split of our common stock distributed on september 23 2005 

 

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

net sales for 2004 were 37703 million an increase of 2766 million or 79 over net sales for 2003 excluding the effect of the 53 rd week for 2003 our net sales increased 3396 million or 99 over net sales for 2003 the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of 61 and contributions from our 125 new stores opened during fiscal 2004 the comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales overall we believe our 2010 store format category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program drove our growth in net sales in addition we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs in our existing markets and our continued focus on a high level of service to our difm customers 

gross profit for 2004 was 17534 million or 465 of net sales as compared to 16045 million or 459 of net sales in 2003 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflect continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and reduced inventory shrinkage 

selling general and administrative expenses increased to 14246 million or 378 of net sales for 2004 from 13163 million or 376 of net sales for 2003 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2004 was primarily a result of increased expenses associated with our selfinsurance programs including the increased costs required to close claims below our stoploss limits and increased medical costs for covered team members due to inflation in the health care sector selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 included 104 million in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount these integration expenses were related to among other things overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses excluding the merger and integration expenses from 2003 selling general and administrative expenses were 373 of net sales 

interest expense for 2004 was 201 million or 05 of net sales as compared to 376 million or 11 of net sales in 2003 the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates due primarily to our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 additionally the decrease resulted from lower average outstanding debt levels on our senior credit facility

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory capital expenditures and contractual obligations in addition we have used available funds to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our senior credit facility as needed 

at december 31 2005 our cash balance was 408 million a decrease of 155 million compared to fiscal yearend 2004 our cash balance decreased primarily due to cash invested in business acquisitions during 2005 partially offset by cash generated from our increased earnings during 2005 as compared to 2004 at december 31 2005 we had outstanding indebtedness consisting primarily of borrowings of 4383 million under our senior credit facility a decrease of 312 million from 2004 additionally we had 546 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility to 1454 million 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels inventory requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our acquisitions 

our capital expenditures were 2162 million in 2005 these amounts included costs related to new store openings the upgrade of our information systems remodels and relocations of existing stores including the completion of our physical conversion of stores acquired in the discount acquisition to our advance auto parts store format in 2006 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 2600 million to 2800 million 

 

table of contents 

our new stores if leased require capital expenditures of approximately 170000 per store and an inventory investment of approximately 170000 per store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store setup costs and training of new store team members average approximately 20000 per store and are expensed when incurred 

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of stores we relocate or remodel during fiscal 2005 we opened 231 stores including 80 stores acquired as part of the acquisitions of ai and lappen auto supply we anticipate adding at least 170 to 180 new stores during fiscal 2006  excluding any acquisitions 

vendor financing program 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms in fiscal 2004 we entered into a shortterm financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases in substance the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth our capacity under this program increased 50 million to 150 million during fiscal 2005 at december 31 2005 1194 million was payable to the bank by us under this program 

stock repurchase program 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 300 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program which became effective august 15 2005 replaced the remaining portion of a 200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in fiscal 2004 the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions form time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission as of december 31 2005 we had repurchased a total of 15 million shares of common stock under the new program at an aggregate cost of 595 million or an average price of 3884 per share excluding related expenses under our previous stock repurchase program we repurchased 70 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1892 million or an average price 2691 per share excluding related expenses at december 31 2005 09 million of stock repurchases remained unsettled 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we also retired 71 million shares of common stock of which 01 million shares were repurchased under the 300 million stock repurchase plan and 70 million shares were repurchased under our previous 200 million stock repurchase program 

at december 31 2005 we had 2405 million excluding related expenses available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program as of march 13 2006 we had repurchased an additional 04 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 187 million 

deferred compensation and postretirement plans 

we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members this plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus as determined by our retirement plan committee we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members’ deferrals to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in certain life insurance contracts accordingly the cash surrender value on these contracts is held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability at december 31 2005 the liability related to this plan was 27 million all of which is current 

we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan at december 31 2005 our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was 163 million the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paidincurred the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined the discount rate utilized at december 31 2005 and january 1 2005 was 55 and 575 respectively we reserve the right to change or terminate the

benefits or contributions at any time we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense effective second quarter of 2004 we amended the plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees effective january 1 2006 due to this negative plan amendment our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by 76 million resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount the unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the 13year estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material this statement requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment or sfas no 123r sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 and subsequently issued stock option related guidance sfas no 123r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period the grantdate fair value of employee

share options and similar instruments will be estimated using optionpricing models if an equity award is modified after the grant date incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 

we are required to apply sfas no 123r to all stock or stockbased awards outstanding and subsequently granted modified or settled as of january 1 2006 sfas no 123r requires us to use either the modifiedprospective method or modifiedretrospective method under the modifiedprospective method we must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption under the modifiedretrospective method we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis as if the prior standard had been adopted under both methods sfas no 123r permits the use of either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 

we have completed our analysis of the impact of sfas no 123r we have decided to use the modifiedprospective method of implementation as of january 1 2006 we plan to use the blackscholes option pricing model to value all options and straightline method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the required service period we expect the implementation of sfas no 123r will decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately 012 for fiscal 2006 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” this statement replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and fasb statement no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” or fin 47 fin 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation used in fasb no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value of the obligation fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation fin 47 was effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 we adopted fin 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 with no impact to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” this statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments currently governed by sfas no 133  “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” or sfas no 133 by allowing fair value remeasurement of hybrid instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation this statement also eliminates the guidance in sfas no 133 implementation issue no d1 “application of statement 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets” which provides such beneficial interests are not subject to sfas no 133 this statement amends sfas no 140 “ accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 125” by eliminating the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a qualifying specialpurpose entity may hold this statement is effective for financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal year 2007 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt our longterm debt currently consists of borrowings under a senior credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities at december 31 2005 approximately 200 million of our bank debt was fixed in accordance with the interest rate swaps described below 

our future exposure to interest rate risk decreased during fiscal 2005 as a result of entering into three new interest rate swap agreements in march 2005 on an aggregate of 175 million of debt under our senior credit facility the first swap fixed our libor rate at 4153 on 50 million of debt for a term of 48 months expiring in march 2009 the second swap fixed our libor rate at 4255 on 75 million of debt for a term of 60 months expiring february 2010 beginning in march 2006 the third swap will fix our libor rate at 46125 on 50 million of debt for a term of 54 months expiring september 2010 

in march 2003 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 125 million of our debt under our credit facility the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 2269 on 750 million of variable rate debt for a term of 36 months expiring in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the second swap which fixed our libor rate at 179 on 500 million of variable rate debt expired in march 2005 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2005 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december 31 2005 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

 item 1 business 

unless the context otherwise requires “advance” “we” “us” “our” and similar terms refer to advance auto parts inc its predecessor its subsidiaries and their respective operations our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the saturday closest to december 31 of each year fiscal 2003 included 53 weeks of operations all other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of operations 

overview we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy customers in the united states based on store count and sales our combined operations are conducted in one operating segment subsequent to the discontinuation of our wholesale distribution network in 2003 

we were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s during the 1980s we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive parts and accessories to diy customers from the 1980s to the present we have grown significantly as a result of strong comparable store sales growth new store openings and strategic acquisitions including our 1998 western auto supply company acquisition and our 2001 acquisition of discount auto parts or discount additionally in 1996 we began to aggressively expand our sales to “doitforme” or difm customers by implementing a commercial delivery program 

at january 1 2005 we operated 2652 stores within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands we operated 2617 stores throughout 39 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores operated under the “advance auto parts” trade name except for certain stores in the state of florida which operated under “advance discount auto parts” or “discount auto parts” trade names our stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks with no significant concentration in any specific area in addition we operated 35 stores under the “western auto” trade name located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands which offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts accessories and maintenance items 

in addition to our diy business we serve difm customers via sales to commercial accounts sales to difm customers represented approximately 18 of our retail sales in 2004 and consisted of sales to both walkin commercial customers and sales delivered to our commercial customers’ places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers at january 1 2005 we had 1945 stores with commercial delivery programs 

we also provide our customers online shopping and access to over 1 million stock keeping units or skus our online site allows our customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchase shipped directly to their home or business 

our internet address is wwwadvanceautopartscom  we make available free of charge through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec 

discontinued operations prior to 2004 we operated a wholesale distribution network that we reported as a separate segment on december 19 2003 we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network the wholesale distribution network consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations for which we 

supplied merchandise inventory and certain services due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively this component of our business operated in the previously reported wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of 24 million and 33 million for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january 1 2005 january 3 2004 and december 28 2002 our operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal for the fiscal year ended january 1 2005 as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal 2003 

competitive strengths we believe our competitive strengths include the following 

  leading market position we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors include national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products although the number of competitors and level of competition vary by market both the diy and difm categories are highly fragmented and generally very competitive we believe we enjoy significant advantages over most of our competitors we believe we have strong brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores based on our significant marketing activities in addition we have purchasing distribution marketing and advertising efficiencies due to our economies of scale 

  industry leading selection of quality products as the number of automotive replacement parts has proliferated we believe our broad inventory selection allows us to meet our diy customers’ demand we believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty automotive parts retailers like us that have the distribution capacity sophisticated information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer a broad inventory selection to diy customers we offer one of the largest selections of brand name and proprietary automotive parts accessories and maintenance items in the automotive aftermarket industry our stores carry between 16000 and 26000 instore skus we also offer approximately 100000 additional skus that are available on a sameday or overnight basis through our pdq ® and our master pdq ® distribution systems including hardertofind replacement parts 

  superior customer service  we believe our customers place significant value on our welltrained store teams who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and installation and this differentiates us from mass merchandisers we invest substantial resources in the recruiting and training of our employees who we refer to as team members and provide formal classroom workshops online seminars and automotive service excellencetm certification to build technical managerial and customer service skills in addition we have a performance management process which aligns each team member’s goals with our strategic corporate goals this process has enabled us to improve our retention of highly qualified team members which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction and higher sales additionally we strive to reach our customers’ needs through our consumer education program designed to improve the customers’ knowledge on performing diy projects and by providing programs viewed over our proprietary instore television network 

  experienced management team with proven track record the 17 members of our senior management team have an average of 10 years of experience with us and 14 years in the industry and have successfully grown our company to become the second largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the united states our management team has accomplished this using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable store sales opening new stores increasing the penetration of our commercial delivery program and making selective acquisitions 

growth strategy our growth strategies consist of the following 

  increase our comparable store sales  we have been among the industry leaders in comparable store sales growth over the last five years averaging 51 annually we plan to increase our comparable store sales in both the 

diy and difm categories by among other things 1 implementing merchandising and marketing initiatives 2 investing in storelevel systems to enhance our ability to recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per customer 3 refining our store selection and instock availability through customized assortments and other supply chain initiatives 4 continuing to increase customer service through store staffing and retention initiatives 5 increasing our commercial delivery sales by focusing on key customers to grow average sales per program and adding programs to markets with commercial opportunities using our database of potential customers and 6 ongoing implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program 

  continue to enhance our margins   in addition to driving operating margin expansion via continued strong comparable store sales growth we will continue to focus on increasing margins by 1 improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors 2 utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity 3 leveraging our overall scale to reduce other operating expenses as a percentage of sales and 4 continuing to implement our category management and custom mix initiatives including the expansion of our private label and proprietary brands 

  increase return on invested capital we believe we can continue to successfully increase our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth and increasing our margins we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets based on our experience such inmarket openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local management resources we intend to open approximately 150 to 175 stores primarily in existing markets in 2005 

industry the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm according to the automotive aftermarket industry association or aaia aftermarket factbook from 1999 to 2003 the diy category grew at a 44 compound annual growth rate from approximately 29 billion to 34 billion this category represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves we believe this category is characterized by stable more recessionresistant demand than most retailers because of the needbased characteristics of the diy category additionally in difficult economic times we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less we also believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer which moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed alternatively in an improving economy we believe the needbased characteristics of our diy customers still exist and they are more inclined to complete preventative maintenance than to defer these activities from 1999 to 2003 the difm category grew at a 46 compound annual growth rate from approximately 60 billion to 72 billion according to the aaia aftermarket factbook this category represents sales to professional installers such as independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their own vehicles 

we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from several favorable trends including the 

 we believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the industry 

store operations our wellmerchandised retail stores are where our customers judge and value our service while completing over 210 million customer interactions per year our focus is to execute our promise “with low prices on quality parts our dedicated team will serve you better”  one customer at a time 

our stores generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle traffic counts good visibility and easy access to major roadways our stores typically range in size from 5000 to 10000 square feet with an average of approximately 7500 square feet and offer approximately 16000 itemssku’s in our standard store in addition we provide a customized product assortment in our hub and undercar stores which provide an additional 600 to 2000 sku’s of merchandise specifically identified based on the demand within an individual market our hub and undercar stores provide a centralized market location for this assortment which benefits all our diy and difm customers within the market our local area warehouse concept utilizes existing space in selected stores to ensure the availability of an additional customized assortment of 8000 to 10000 skus on a same day basis in addition to our hub and undercar store product assortments at january 1 2005 we operated 49 local area warehouses

  total stores  our 2652 retail stores were located in the following states and territories at january 1 2005 

 the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the number of our stores during the past five years 

  merchandising and replenishment virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel at our corporate offices in roanoke virginia in 2004 we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 7 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating multiyear agreements with certain vendors which allows us to achieve more favorable terms and pricing 

our merchandising and replenishment teams are currently led by a group of seven senior professionals who have an average of 16 years of automotive purchasing experience and over 23 years in retail the replenishment team is skilled in sourcing products globally and maintaining high quality levels while streamlining costs associated with the handling of merchandise through the supply chain the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilizes a highly effective category management process we believe this process which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category improves comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as monroe bendix purolator and trico which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories we are currently in the process of customizing our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store the custom assortment is based on that store’s historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific customer needs 

supply chain our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers or dcs and pdq warehouses our inventory management team utilizes replenishment systems to monitor the distribution center and pdq warehouse inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate in addition the replenishment system tracks sales trends by sku allowing us to adjust future orders to support seasonal and demographic shifts in demand our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain a reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times and decreased third party freight and billing service costs 

we currently operate eight distribution centers including our new lehigh facility which will begin servicing our expanding store base in the northeast in april 2005 all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution management system or dcms our dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency this equipment includes carousels “pickto light” systems robotic picking radio frequency technology and automated sorting systems through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity which will provide us the capacity to service over 3800 stores including the benefit we expect to realize from our northeast dc 

we currently offer over 40000 skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our 16 standalone pdq® warehouses andor our distribution centers which also stock pdq® items stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities or as an alternative through an online ordering system ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq® trucking fleet in addition we operate a pdq® warehouse that stocks approximately 61000 skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories this facility is known as the “master pdq®” warehouse and utilizes existing pdq® distribution infrastructure to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 

advertising we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings product assortment competitive prices free services battery testing and installation electrical system testing wiper replacement and oil recycling and commitment to customer service the program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the solution for a customer’s automotive needs we utilize a mix of media that reinforces our brand image including television radio print promotional signage and outdoor media plus our proprietary instore television network and internet site 

our advertising plan is a brandbuilding program built around television and radio advertising the plan is supported by print and instore signage our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming radio advertising which is used as a supplementary medium generally airs during peak drive times we also sponsor sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots effort to positively impact individual communities including hispanic and other ethnic communities to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 

since early 2003 we’ve supported our new advertising campaign “we’re ready in advance” throughout all of our media we believe this advertising campaign differentiates advance auto parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance auto parts as a special place to shop 

in 2004 we built upon the campaign by initiating a consumer education program this program is intended to build our image as not only the source for product but also the best resource for vehicle maintenance information our free brochure kiosk displaying “we’re ready with answers” and our free monthly video clinic broadcasts on advance tv our exclusive instore howto network are just two elements of this growing program we believe we will differentiate our stores from our competitors’ by providing our customers valuable information regarding “whyto” and “howto” perform regular maintenance on their vehicles in order to enhance their vehicles’ performance reliability safety and appearance our goal with this initiative is to continue our longterm brand building success increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base

enterprise information system our management team has online access to certain financial information via hyperion analyzer a webenabled frontend tool which retrieves information from a centralized database this system which is tightly integrated to our “best in class” peoplesoft financial and human resource systems helps ensure that accurate consistent and timely financial information including our sales margin payroll and other key metrics is available to all levels of management this system assists the management team in planning and responding to our business and industry trends quickly and costeffectively this system contains analysis tools that provide our management the ability to rank and rate their operations and identify “best practices” opportunities for business improvement 

store based information systems our store based information systems which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of pointofsale or pos electronic parts catalog or epc storelevel inventory management and store intranet or storenet systems additionally we support store level operations with our management planning and training and customer contact systems these systems are integrated tightly and together provide real time comprehensive information to store and merchandising personnel resulting in improved customer service levels team member productivity and instock availability 

  pointofsale  our pos system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly we completed the implementation of our new pos system or apal in all of our stores operating under the “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” and “discount auto parts” trade names during 2004 apal is designed to improve customer checkout time and decrease the time required to train newly hired team members in addition apal provides additional customer purchase history which may be used for customer demographic analysis 

  electronic parts catalog  our epc system is a software system that enables our store team members to identify over 40 million application uses for automotive parts and accessories the epc system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year make model and engine type of their vehicle if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our stores the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our pdq® system the epc system also enables our store team 

members to identify additional parts that are required by our customers to complete their automotive repair projects this generally leads to an increase in average sales per transaction the integration of this system with our pos system improves customer service by reducing time spent at the cash register and fully automating the sales process between the parts counter and our pos register this system enables store team members to order parts and accessories electronically through our pdq® system with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time additionally information about a customer’s automobile can be entered into a permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits or telephones one of our stores 

in conjunction with the rollout of apal we also enhanced our epc system in our stores the enhanced epc system which is fully integrated with apal provides the capability of cataloging nonapplication specific parts and additional product information such as technical service bulletins installation instructions images of parts and related diagrams of automotive systems the enhanced epc system contains enhanced search engines and more userfriendly navigation tools that enhance our store team members’ ability to lookup any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project we believe these components will enhance our customers’ shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair job the first time saving them time and money 

to ensure ongoing improvement of epc information in all stores we have developed a centrally based epc data management system that enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalogue and deliver updated accurate product information to our stores additionally we are enhancing the epc system to provide additional methods of parts lookup while reducing keystrokes and allowing our store team members to more efficiently serve our customers

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under “forward looking statements” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

  our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31 of each year our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal 2003 which consisted of 13 weeks due to our 53 week fiscal year in 2003 

introduction we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy customers in united states based on store count and sales our operations are conducted in one operating segment 

at january 1 2005 we operated 2617 stores throughout 39 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores operated under the “advance auto parts” trade name except 

for certain stores in the state of florida which operated under “advance discount auto parts” or “discount auto parts” trade names these stores offered automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items with no significant concentration in any specific product area in addition we operated 35 stores under the “western auto” trade name located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands which offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts accessories and maintenance items 

the following table sets forth the number of new closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 we lease approximately 80 of our stores 

 we anticipate adding approximately 150 to 175 new stores during 2005 primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions 

management overview in 2004 we produced solid growth in our sales and earnings and ended the year with strong sales momentum during the fourth quarter we believe this momentum confirms that our initiatives are working and further makes us believe we are very well positioned for 2005 and beyond in addition our industry dynamics continue to become more positive each year the average age of vehicles continues to increase and is now over nine years old currently over 60 of actively driven vehicles are at least six years old and are beginning to enter the period when parts begin to fail the replacement parts for these vehicles are higher due to the technological changes in recent models and the shift from cars to light trucks and sport utility vehicles beyond the positive fundamentals of our industry the implementation of our initiatives remains on schedule our specific focus is to drive higher sales per store and thereby leverage our fixed expenses the initiatives for driving this sales growth include 

 in addition we are focused on optimizing our overall expenses at all levels of the organization as well as continuing to execute our supply chain initiatives to better optimize our distribution costs and make our logistics network operate more efficiently and more productively 

the following table highlights certain operating results and key metrics for 2004 2003 and 2002 

   key 2004 events the following key events occurred during 2004 and reflect opportunities that will support our strategic initiatives discussed above 

 discontinued operations prior to 2004 we operated a second segment for our wholesale business on december 19 2003 we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network the wholesale distribution network or wholesale consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of 24 million and 33 million for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 represented the 

entire results of operations previously reported in that segment we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january 3 2004 and december 28 2002 to reflect this decision for the fiscal year ended january 1 2005 the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal 2003 

critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed andor payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other promotional consideration we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” many of the incentives are provided under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis certain vendors require us to use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising we define these allowances as restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

we recognize certain other promotional incentives earned under longterm supply agreements as a reduction to cost of sales these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the agreement the estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for that product and could positively or negatively impact our cost of sales if actual purchases or results from any year differ from our estimates however incentives earned over the life of the agreement would be the same incentives associated with shortterm agreements are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreements 

amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in accounts receivable except for that portion expected to be received after one year which is included in other assets 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink as an increase to our cost of sales for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 

reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we develop these estimates 

based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost if any required by market conditions future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

warranty reserves 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims we are responsible for merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries and roadside assistance we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

selfinsured reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members although we maintain stoploss coverage with thirdparty insurers to limit our total liability exposure a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost which we calculate using analyses of historical data demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by thirdparty actuaries management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves on a periodic basis we also review our assumptions with our thirdparty actuaries while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates our selfinsurance reserves and corresponding selling general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 

leases and leasehold improvements 

we lease certain store locations distribution centers office space equipment and vehicles we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes certain leases contain rent escalation clauses which are recorded on a straightline basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straightline rent recorded as a deferred rent liability lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straightline basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent in addition leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 

closed store liabilities 

we recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased store location the reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs for common area maintenance and taxes offset by the present value of management’s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts these estimates are based on current market conditions and our experience of obtaining subleases or buyouts on similar properties however our inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling general and administrative expenses as well as our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows 

components of statement of operations net sales 

net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales new store net sales service sales offered only in the western auto retail locations and finance charges on installment sales we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening we exclude net sales from the 35 western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings including automotive service and tires 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and consists of 52 or 53 weeks our 2004 fiscal year began on january 4 2004 and consisted of 52 weeks while our 2003 fiscal year began on december 29 2002 and consisted of 53 weeks the extra week of operations in fiscal 2003 results in our fiscal 2004 consisting of noncomparable calendar weeks to fiscal 2003 to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal 2004 we have compared the calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal 2003 accordingly our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal 2004 excludes week one of operations from fiscal 2003 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent net advertising expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses and other related expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration 

results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

net sales for 2004 were 37703 million an increase of 2766 million or 79 over net sales for 2003 excluding the effect of the 53 rd week for 2003 our net sales increased 3396 million or 99 over net sales for 2003 the net sales increase was due to an increase in the comparable store sales of 61 and contributions from our 125 new stores opened within the last year the comparable store sales increase was driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales overall we believe our 2010 store format category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program drove our growth in net sales in addition we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs in our existing markets and our continued focus on a high level of service to our difm customers 

gross profit for 2004 was 17534 million or 465 of net sales as compared to 16045 million or 459 of net sales in 2003 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and reduced inventory shrinkage in 2005 we anticipate our gross profit to continue to improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management initiatives including the expansion of our private label brand and proprietary brands and the continued execution of our supply chain initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increased to 14246 million or 378 of net sales for 2004 from 13163 million or 376 of net sales for 2003 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2004 was primarily a result of increased expenses associated with our selfinsurance programs including the increased costs required to close claims below our stoploss limits and increased medical costs for covered team members due to inflation in the health care sector selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 included 104 million in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount these integration expenses were related to among other things overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses excluding the merger and integration expenses from 2003 selling general and administrative expenses were 373 of net sales 

interest expense for 2004 was 201 million or 05 of net sales as compared to 376 million or 11 of net sales in 2003 the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 additionally the decrease is a result of lower average outstanding debt levels on our senior credit facility 

throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 

income tax expense for 2004 was 1177 million as compared to 784 million for 2003 this increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings our effective income tax rate was 385 for both 2004 and 2003 

we recorded net income of 1880 million 249 per diluted share for 2004 as compared to 1249 million or 167 per diluted share for 2003 as a percentage of sales net income for 2004 was 50 as compared to 36 for 2003 our net income for 2003 included the effect of expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt of 355 million or 047 per diluted share 

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

net sales for 2003 were 34937 million an increase of 2896 million or 90 over net sales for 2002 excluding the effect of the 53 rd week our net sales increased 2266 million or 71 over net sales for 2002 the net sales increase was due to an increase in the comparable store sales of 31 driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales and contributions from the 125 new stores opened within the last year increases in both our diy and difm business contributed to the comparable store sales increase 

gross profit for 2003 was 16045 million or 459 of net sales as compared to 14344 million or 448 of net sales in 2002 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and improved efficiencies in our logistics network 

selling general and administrative expenses including merger and integration costs of 104 million in 2003 increased to 13163 million or 376 of net sales for 2003 from 12381 million or 387 of net sales for 2002 in 2002 merger and integration costs were 355 million the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a decrease in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount these integration expenses are related to among other things overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses the decline in merger and integration costs was anticipated as we approached the completion of the discount integration excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs the decline in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs as a result of the impact of the 53 rd week of operations in the fourth quarter of 2003 

interest expense for 2003 was 376 million or 11 of net sales as compared to 771 million or 24 of net sales in 2002 the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter 2003 additionally the decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in 2003 as compared to 2002 

income tax expense for 2003 was 784 million as compared to 395 million for 2002 our effective income tax rate decreased to 385 for 2003 as compared to 388 for 2002 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pretax income which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 

during 2003 we recorded 473 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt this loss reflects the writeoff of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and also includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility to finance this redemption additionally this loss includes the ratable portion of deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal 2003 

we recorded net income of 1249 million 167 per diluted share for 2003 as compared to 650 million or 090 per diluted share for 2002 as a percentage of sales net income for 2003 was 36 as compared to 20 for 2002 the effect of the expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was 355 million or 047 per diluted share for 2003 and 320 million or 044 per diluted share for 2002 these per share amounts reflect the twoforone stock split declared in 2003 

quarterly financial results unaudited in thousands except per share data  liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity 

our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory capital expenditures repurchasing shares under our stock repurchase program and contractual obligations we have financed these requirements primarily through a combination of cash generated from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 

at january 1 2005 our cash balance was 563 million an increase of 448 million compared to 2003 our cash balance increased primarily due to our increased earnings in 2004 as well as a decrease in cash used to repay or redeem indebtedness compared to 2003 in 2003 we used available funds combined with borrowings under our senior credit facility to redeem our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes at january 1 2005 we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of 4700 million under our senior credit facility an increase of 250 million from 2003 additionally we had 388 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to 1612 million our availability under our revolving credit facility increased by 388 million from 1224 at the end of fiscal 2003 due to the increase in our revolving credit facility from 1600 million to 2000 million this increase resulted from the refinancing of our senior credit facility which gives us additional funds for our primary cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels inventory requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions 

our capital expenditures were 1798 million in 2004 these amounts included costs of 500 million for the construction and preparation of our northeastern distribution center and additional amounts related to new store openings the upgrade of our information systems remodels and relocations of existing stores including our continued physical conversion of stores acquired in the discount acquisition to our advance auto parts store format in 2005 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 1800 million to 2000 million 

our new stores if leased require capital expenditures of approximately 160000 per store and an inventory investment of approximately 170000 per store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store setup costs and training of new store team members average approximately 20000 per store and are expensed when incurred 

our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year we opened 125 new stores each year during 2004 and 2003 we anticipate adding approximately 150 to 175 new stores during 2005 primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions 

vendor financing program 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we entered into a shortterm financing program with a bank allowing us to extend our payment terms on certain merchandise purchases under this program we issue negotiable instruments to our vendors in lieu of a cash payment each vendor is able to present the instrument to the bank for payment at an agreed upon discount rate at january 1 2005 569 million was payable to the bank by us under this program this program will allow us to further reduce our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth additionally our new senior credit facility allows us to increase our capacity under this program from 100 million to 150 million during 2005 

stock repurchase program 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 2000 million of our common stock plus related expenses the program will allow us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions form time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission as of january 1 2005 we had repurchased a total of 37 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1462 million or 3952 per share at january 1 2005 we had 538 million excluding related expenses available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program as of march 9 2005 we had repurchased an additional 10 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 430 million 

deferred compensation and postretirement plans 

we maintain two deferred compensation plans our ongoing plan was established in 2003 as an unqualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members this plan provides for a mimimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus as determined by our retirement plan committee we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members’ deferral to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in trading securities accordingly all gains and losses on these underlying investments are held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability at january 1 2005 the liability related to this plan was 18 million all of which is current we also maintain an unfunded deferred compensation plan established prior to the 1998 western merger for certain key team members of western the plan was frozen at the date of the western merger at january 1 2005 the total liability for the western plan was 16 million of which 03 million is recorded as a current liability the classification for the western deferred compensation plan is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants which can be changed upon 12 months’ notice 

we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan at january 1 2005 our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was 174 million the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paidincurred the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined the discount rate utilized at january 1 2005 and january 4 2004 was 575 and 625 respectively we reserve the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense effective second quarter of 2004 we amended the plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees effective january 1 2006 due to this negative plan amendment our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by 76 million resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount the unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants of 13 years

 contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to longterm debt and operating leases at january 1 2005 were as follows 

   long term debt   senior credit facility on november 3 2004 we entered into a new amended and restated 670 million senior credit facility the new senior facility provides for a 2000 million tranche a term loan and a 1700 million tranche b term loan proceeds from these term loans were used to refinance our tranche d and e term loans and revolver under our previous facility additionally the new senior credit facility provides for a 1000 million delayed draw term loan which is available exclusively for stock buybacks under our stock repurchase program and a 2000 million revolving facility or the revolver which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of 700 million in conjunction with this refinancing we wroteoff deferred financing costs related to the previous term loans in accordance with eitf issue no 9619 “debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments” the writeoff of these costs combined with additional costs required to establish the new facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 28 million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january 1 2005 earlier during fiscal 2004 we made 1050 million of repayments on our previous senior credit facility prior to their scheduled maturity in conjunction with these partial repayments we wroteoff 04 million which is also classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january 1 2005 

at january 1 2005 our senior credit facility consisted of 1 a tranche a term loan facility with a balance of 2000 million a tranche b term loan facility with a balance of 1700 million a delayed draw term loan with a balance of 1000 million and 2 a 2000 million revolving credit facility including a letter of credit sub facility of which 1612 million was available as a result of 388 million in letters of credit outstanding the senior credit 

facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries and is secured by all of our assets and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries 

the tranche a term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of 75 million on march 31 2005 and quarterly thereafter through december 31 2006 100 million on march 31 2007 and quarterly thereafter through december 31 2007 125 million on march 31 2008 and quarterly thereafter through june 30 2009 and 250 million due at maturity on september 30 2009 the tranche b term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of 04 million on march 31 2005 and quarterly thereafter with a final payment of 1607 million due at maturity on september 30 2010 the delayed draw term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of 025 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on march 31 2006 and quarterly thereafter with a final payment due at maturity on september 30 2010 the revolver expires on september 30 2009 

the interest rates on the tranche a and b term loans the delayed draw term loan and the revolver are based at our option on an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the initial margin for the tranche a term loan and revolver is 150 and 050 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively the initial margin for the tranche b term loan and the delayed draw term loan is 175 and 075 per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings respectively additionally a commitment fee of 0375 per annum is charged on the unused portion of the tranche a term loan and revolver payable in arrears a commitment fee of 175 per annum is charged on the unused portion of the delayed draw term loan payable in arrears 

as of january 1 2005 we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding on an aggregate of 125 million of debt under our credit facility the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 2269 on 750 million of variable rate debt the first swap has a term of 36 months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 179 on 500 million of variable rate debt the second swap has a term of 24 months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 

subsequent to january 1 2005 and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk we entered into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 175 million of debt under our senior credit facility 

 the senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all subject to certain exceptions of our assets and the assets of our existing domestic subsidiaries and will be secured by the properties and assets of our future domestic subsidiaries the senior credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to among other things 1 declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock 2 prepay redeem or purchase debt 3 incur liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions 4 make loans and investments 5 incur additional debt including hedging arrangements 6 engage in certain mergers acquisitions and asset sales 7 engage in transactions with affiliates 8 change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and 9 change our passive holding company status we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio a minimum interest coverage ratio a minimum current assets to funded senior debt ratio a maximum senior leverage ratio and limits on capital expenditures we were in compliance with the above covenants at january 1 2005 

credit ratings at january 1 2005 we had a credit rating on our senior credit facility from standard  poor’s of bb and a credit rating of ba2 from moody’s investor service the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our senior credit facility is based on such credit ratings if these credit ratings decline our interest expense may increase conversely if these credit ratings increase our interest expense may decrease 

seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail 

recent accounting pronouncements in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” as a result of rescinding fasb statement no 4 “reporting gains losses from extinguishment of debt” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” this statement also amends fasb statement no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we adopted sfas no 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for the fiscal years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of 3230 47288 and 16822 

in july 2003 as subsequently updated in november 2003 the fasb released emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 by resellers to sales incentives offered to customers by manufacturers” this eitf addresses whether a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance with the guidance in eitf issue no 0216 for purposes of this issue the “vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is limited to a vendor’s incentive i that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept manufacturer’s incentives in partial or full of the price charged by the reseller for the vendor’s product ii for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement from the vendor or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor based on the face amount of the incentive iii for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the reseller but rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to consumers and iv whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the vendor whether expressed or implied in the sales incentive transaction between the vendor and the consumer the consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such criteria are not subject to the guidance in issue no 0216 the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after november 25 2003 we adopted this release during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 with no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in may 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position or fsp 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” fsp 1062 addresses the appropriate accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription drug benefits the new guidance was deemed necessary as a result of the 2003 medicare prescription law which includes a federal subsidy for qualifying companies the effective date of fsp 1062 is the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2004 we completed a negative plan amendment to eliminate outpatient prescription drug benefits from our postretirement plan effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 therefore the adoption of fsp 1062 had no impact on our financial position results of operations or related footnote disclosure 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material this statement requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” or sfas no 123r sfas no 123r replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and subsequently issued stock option related guidance this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using optionpricing models if an equity award is modified after the grant date incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 

we are required to apply sfas no 123r to all awards granted modified or settled as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 we are also required to use either the modifiedprospective method or modifiedretrospective method under the modifiedprospective method we must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption under the modifiedretrospective method we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis as if the prior standard had been adopted under both methods we are permitted to use either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting the standard permits and encourages early adoption 

we have commenced our analysis of the impact of sfas no 123r but have not yet decided 1 whether we elect to early adopt 2 if we elect to early adopt what date we would do so 3 whether we will use the modifiedprospective or modifiedretrospective method and 4 whether we will elect to use straight line or an accelerated method accordingly we have not determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r will have on our financial position or results of operations 

risk factors risks relating to our business we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy 

 we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 

we have increased our store count significantly from 1567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2652 stores at january 1 2005 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores there can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things 

 there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts 

if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons including 

 if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members at march 9 2005 we employed 37795 team members we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members as needed in the future our ability to maintain an adequate level of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package if we fail to maintain such an adequate compensation and benefits package our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including price name recognition customer service and location we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry and primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products these competitors and the level of competition vary by market some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including a greater amount of marketing activities a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors’ operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and on other terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions in particular we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment discrimination asbestos exposure and product defects the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 

risks relating to our financial condition the covenants governing our senior credit facility impose significant restrictions on us 

the terms of our senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior credit facility furthermore our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 

our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations our financial and operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 if we are unable to service our debt we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital however we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate also some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies including foreclosing on our assets under those circumstances our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt our longterm debt currently consists of borrowings under a senior credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities our future exposure to interest rate risk increased during 

2004 due to the expiration of our 1500 million zerocost collar during november 2004 

in march 2003 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 125 million of our debt under our credit facility the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 2269 on 750 million of variable rate debt for a term of 36 months expiring in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 179 on 500 million of variable rate debt for a term of 24 months expiring in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 

subsequent to january 1 2005 and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk we entered into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 175 million of debt under our senior credit facility the detail for the individual swaps is as follows 

 the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm debt outstanding at january 1 2005 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 1 2005 as adjusted by the limitations of the swap agreement the impact of our three interest rate swap agreements entered into in march 2005 are not reflected in the table below implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

unless the context otherwise requires “advance” “we” “us” “our” and similar terms refer to advance auto parts inc its predecessor its subsidiaries and their respective operations our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the saturday closest to december 31 of each year fiscal 2003 included 53 weeks of operations all other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of operations 

overview 

we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to “doityourself” or diy customers in the united states 

based on store count and sales our combined operations are now conducted in our retail operating segment subsequent to the discontinuation of the wholesale distribution network in 2003 

we were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s during the 1980s we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive parts and accessories to diy customers from the 1980s to the present we have grown significantly as a result of strong comparable store sales growth new store openings and strategic acquisitions including our 1998 western auto supply company acquisition and our 2001 acquisition of discount auto parts or discount additionally in 1996 we began to aggressively expand our sales to “doitforme” or difm customers by implementing a commercial delivery program 

at january 3 2004 we operated 2539 stores within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands we operated 2503 stores throughout 39 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores operated primarily under the “advance auto parts” trade name except for the state of florida which operated under “advance discount auto parts” or “discount auto parts” trade names our stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks with no significant concentration in any specific area in addition we operated 36 stores under the “western auto” trade name located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands which offer certain home and garden merchandise in addition to automotive parts accessories and service 

in addition to our diy business we serve difm customers via sales to commercial accounts sales to difm customers represented approximately 16 of our retail sales in 2003 and consisted of sales to both walkin commercial customers and sales delivered to our commercial customers’ places of business including independent garages service stations and auto dealers at january 3 2004 we had 1625 stores with commercial delivery programs 

we also provide our customers online shopping and access to over 1 million stock keeping units or skus our online site allows our customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchase shipped directly to their home or business 

our internet address is wwwadvanceautopartscom  we make available free of charge through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the securities act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec 

discontinued operations 

on december 19 2003 we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network the wholesale distribution network consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively this component of our business operated in the previously reported wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of 24 million 33 million and 55 million for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january 3 2004 december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 

competitive strengths 

we believe our competitive strengths include the following 

  leading market position we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors include national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers 

that carry automotive products although the number of competitors and level of competition vary by market both the diy and difm categories are highly fragmented and generally very competitive we enjoy significant advantages over most of our competitors we believe we have strong brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores based on our significant marketing activities in addition we have purchasing distribution marketing and advertising efficiencies due to our economies of scale in particular our acquisition of discount auto parts in november 2001 has provided us with the leading market position in florida which is especially attractive due to that state’s strong diy customer demographics 

  industry leading selection of quality products as the number of automotive replacement parts has proliferated we believe discount stores and mass merchandisers have had increasing difficulties in maintaining a broad inventory selection that diy customers demand we believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty automotive parts retailers like us that have the distribution capacity sophisticated information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer a broad inventory selection to diy customers we offer one of the largest selections of brand name and proprietary automotive parts accessories and maintenance items in the automotive aftermarket industry our stores carry between 16500 and 26500 instore skus we also offer approximately 100000 additional skus that are available on a sameday or overnight basis through our pdq® and our master pdq® distribution systems including hardertofind replacement parts 

  superior customer service we believe that our customers place significant value on our welltrained sales associates who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and installation and that this differentiates us from mass merchandisers we invest substantial resources in the recruiting and training of our employees who we refer to as team members and provide formal classroom workshops seminars and automotive service excellencetm certification to build technical managerial and customer service skills in addition we have a performance management process that allows us to align each team member’s goals with our strategic corporate goals this process has resulted in increased team member retention which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction and higher sales and differentiates us from mass merchandisers 

  experienced management team with proven track record the 18 members of our senior management team have an average of 10 years of experience with us and 14 years in the industry and have successfully grown our company to the second largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the united states our management team has accomplished this using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable store sales opening new stores increasing the penetration of our commercial delivery program and making selective acquisitions 

growth strategy 

our growth strategies consist of the following 

  increase our comparable store sales   we have been among the industry leaders in comparable store sales growth over the last five years averaging 59 annually we plan to increase our comparable store sales in both the diy and difm categories by among other things 1 implementing merchandising and marketing initiatives 2 investing in storelevel systems to enhance our ability to recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per customer 3 refining our store selection and instock availability through customized assortments and other supply chain initiatives 4 continuing to increase customer service through store staffing and retention initiatives and 5 increasing our commercial delivery sales by focusing on key customers to grow average sales per program and adding programs to markets with commercial opportunities using our database of potential customers in particular we intend to continue to make the necessary investments in several applications that are critical to improving our customer service and instock availability we have established strong inventory management systems at the store and distribution center level and have implemented advance parts accessories lookup or apal our new fully integrated pointofsale system and electronic parts catalog in approximately 85 of our stores 

  continue to enhance our margins   in addition to driving operating margin expansion via continued strong comparable store sales growth we will continue to focus on increasing margins by 1 improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors 2 utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity 3 leveraging our overall scale to reduce other operating expenses as a percentage of sales and 4 continuing to implement our category management initiatives and custom 

mix initiatives 

  increase return on invested capital we believe we can continue to successfully increase our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth and increasing our margins we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets based on our experience such inmarket openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local management resources we intend to open approximately 125 to 135 stores in existing markets in 2004 primarily through new store openings

the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm according to the automotive aftermarket industry association or aaia aftermarket factbook from 1997 to 2002 the diy category grew at a 39 compound annual growth rate from approximately 27 billion to 35 billion this category represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves we believe this category is characterized by stable more recessionresistant demand than most retailers because of the needbased characteristics of the diy category additionally in difficult economic times we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less we also believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer which moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed alternatively in an improving economy we believe the needbased characteristics of our diy customers still exist and they are more inclined to complete preventative maintenance than to defer these activities from 1997 to 2002 the difm category grew at a 50 compound annual growth rate from approximately 57 billion to 73 billion according to the aaia aftermarket factbook this category represents sales to professional installers such as independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less price sensitive or who are less inclined to repair their own vehicles 

we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from several favorable trends including the 

 we believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the industry

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in february 2000 the coalition for a level playing field and over 100 independent automotive parts and accessories aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers filed a lawsuit styled coalition for a level playing field et al v autozone inc et al case no 000953 in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york against various automotive parts and accessories retailers in march 2000 we were notified that we had been named defendants in the lawsuit the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants knowingly induced and received volume discounts rebates slotting and other allowances fees free inventory sham advertising and promotional payments a share in the manufacturers’ profits and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation of the robinsonpatman act in january 2003 a trial was held and the jury found that we did not violate the robinsonpatman act the plantiffs subsequently appealed this decision however in november 2003 the court of appeals upheld the verdict 

our western auto subsidiary together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products we discount and parts america also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants to date these products have included brake and clutch parts and roofing materials the number of cases in which we or one of our subsidiaries has been named as a defendant has increased in the past year many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial additionally some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants we believe that we have valid defenses against these claims we also believe that most of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us however if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and liquidity if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and liquidity in future periods

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report our discussion contains forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of factors including those set forth under “forward looking statements” and “risk factors” elsewhere in this report 

  our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december 31 of each year our first quarter consists of 16 weeks and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal 2003 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53 week fiscal year in 2003 

introduction 

in 2003 we produced strong operating results and built momentum to carry us into what we believe will be another successful year in 2004 our 2003 performance and our positive outlook for 2004 is primarily a result of our management team’s focus to drive topline sales growth and increase our operating margins through our category management initiatives our national advertising campaign and leveraging our logistics and operating expenses the category management initiative not only drives topline sales by developing improved product assortments by category but also focusing on maximizing gross profit within each product category offered for 2003 we grew our total sales by 90 over last year to 35 billion including the 53rd week we also improved our operating margins to 83 of total sales including the 53rd week an increase of 468 over 2002 in addition to the above initiatives our operating margins benefited from leveraging our selling general and administrative expenses 

additionally we evaluate the quality of our results based on growth in certain key financial metrics these key indicators consist primarily of 

   general 

we operated stores within the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands at january 3 2004 we operated 2503 stores throughout 39 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states these stores operated primarily under the “advance auto parts” trade name except for the state of florida which operated under “advance discount auto parts” or “discount auto parts” trade names these stores offered automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items with no significant concentration in any specific area in addition we operated 36 stores under the “western auto” trade name located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands which offer certain home and garden merchandise in addition to automotive parts accessories and service 

 stock split 

on october 29 2003 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split of our common stock effected as a 100 stock dividend the dividend was distributed on january 2 2004 to holders of record as of december 11 2003 and began trading on a postsplit basis on january 5 2004 all references to share and per share amounts in this discussion and analysis reflect the effect of the stock split 

discontinued operations 

on december 19 2003 we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network the wholesale distribution network or wholesale consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area it had become difficult to 

serve these dealers effectively this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of 24 million 33 million and 55 million for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january 3 2004 december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 to reflect this decision 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 

vendor incentives 

as discussed further elsewhere in this report we recognize certain vendor incentives earned related to longterm supply agreements as a reduction to cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing of purchases not as reductions to inventory the functional amounts earned under longterm arrangements are based on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned the incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract the estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for certain product and could positively or negatively impact our gross margins if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates however incentives earned over the life of the contract would be the same 

inventory reserves 

we establish reserves for inventory shrink for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves if the effectiveness of the program declines management estimates will be required to ensure the accuracy of the overall shrink reserves 

reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost if any required by market conditions future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 

warranty reserves 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendors’ warranties include batteries tires roadside assistance and craftsman products we record accruals for future warranty claims based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required we have seen positive trends in the defective rates of our batteries sold which have offset historically higher trends used to 

develop our battery warranty accrual resulting in overall lower warranty expense on our consolidated statement of operations we believe these positive trends are a result of quality enhancements of our currently offered battery line and better policies and procedures surrounding the testing and defecting of batteries by our store personnel while we expect these positive trends to continue an increase in defective rates would have a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 

selfinsured reserves 

we are selfinsured for general and automobile liability workers’ compensation and the health care claims of our team members therefore we record estimated reserve amounts for the settlement of such claims below our stoploss limits these estimates are developed based on information obtained through our claims management procedures from actual claims reported to us and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported this information is obtained through a collaboration of both our internal and external claims professionals and third party administrators the estimated claim cost is actively reviewed for changes in claim facts or action plans and negative trends related to claims incurred but not reported accordingly our estimated reserves may require an adjustment to previously recorded amounts 

restructuring and closed store liabilities 

we recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a store location closes the provision includes future minimum lease payments and common area maintenance and taxes all reduced by management’s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts these estimates are based on current market and our experience of executing subleases or buyouts on similar properties however our inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could negatively impact our result of operations and cash flows 

components of statement of operations 

net sales 

net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales new store net sales and finance charges on installment sales comparable store sales is calculated based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods each accounting period represents four weeks relocations are included in comparable store sales from the original date of opening our 2003 comparable store sales results include the 53rd week of operation compared to our first week of operation in 2003 the comparable calendar week stores acquired in the discount acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in december 2002 which was 13 complete accounting periods after the acquisition date of november 28 2001 we do not include net sales from the 36 western auto retail stores in our comparable store sales calculation as a result of their unique product offerings including specialty merchandise 

cost of sales 

our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs net of incentives under vendor programs and warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll store occupancy including rent net advertising expenses other store expenses and general and administrative expenses including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members administrative office expenses data processing professional expenses and other related expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration we lease a significant portion of our stores 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

net sales for 2003 were 34937 million an increase of 2896 million or 90 over net sales for 2002 excluding the effect of the 53rd week our net sales increased 2266 million or 71 over net sales for 2002 the net sales increase was due to an increase in the comparable store sales of 31 driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales and contributions from new stores opened within the last year as previously mentioned increases in both our diy and difm business contributed to the comparable store sales increase 

gross profit for 2003 was 16045 million or 459 of net sales as compared to 14344 million or 448 of net sales in 2002 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and improved efficiencies in our logistics network in 2004 we anticipate our gross profit to continue to improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management initiatives and leveraging our logistics expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses including merger and integration costs of 104 million in 2003 and 355 million in 2002 increased to 13163 million or 376 of net sales for 2003 from 12381 million or 387 of net sales for 2002 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a decrease in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount these integration expenses are related to among other things overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses the decline in merger and integration costs was anticipated as we near the completion of the discount integration excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs the decline as a percentage of net sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs with the impact of the 53rd week of operations in the fourth quarter of 2003 

interest expense for 2003 was 376 million or 11 of net sales as compared to 771 million or 24 of net sales in 2002 the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter 2003 additionally the decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to our use of free cash flow to pay down debt 

income tax expense for 2003 was 784 million as compared to 395 million for 2002 our effective income tax rate decreased to 385 for 2003 as compared to 388 for 2002 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pretax income which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 

during 2003 we recorded 473 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt this loss reflects the writeoff of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and also includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility to finance this redemption additionally this loss includes the ratable portion of deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal 2003 

we recorded net income of 1249 million 167 per diluted share for 2003 as compared to 650 million or 090 per diluted share for 2002 as a percentage of sales net income for 2003 was 36 as compared to 20 for 2002 the effect of the expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was 355 million or 047 per diluted share for 2003 and 320 million or 044 per diluted share for 2002 as previously mentioned these per share amounts reflect the twoforone stock split declared in 2003 

fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 

net sales for 2002 were 32041 million an increase of 7844 million or 324 over net sales for 2001 the net sales increase was due to an increase a full year’s contribution of sales from stores acquired in the discount acquisition in the comparable store sales of 55 and contributions from new stores opened within the last year the comparable store sales increase was a result of growth in both the diy and difm market segments indicated by an increase in both comparative customers and average customer sales as well as the continued maturation of new stores 

gross profit for 2002 was 14344 million or 448 of net sales as compared to 10531 million or 435 of net sales in 2001 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects more favorable merchandise costs realized in fiscal 2002 as a result of renegotiating merchandise contracts after the discount acquisition additionally this increase represents our ability to leverage logistics costs primarily driven by a review of our logistics operations which occurred in connection with our supply chain initiatives we began these initiatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 in which we recorded a 91 million charge for restocking and handling fees associated with the return of inventory under these initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses increased to 12381 million or 387 of net sales for 2002 from 9686 million or 400 of net sales for 2001 selling general and administrative expenses include merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount of 355 million or 11 of sales and 49 million or 02 of sales for 2002 and 2001 respectively these integration expenses are related to among other things merger related restructuring overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses the merger related restructuring charges primarily relate to lease costs associated with closed advance auto parts stores in overlapping markets as a result of the discount acquisition additionally selling general and administrative expenses include charges of 254 million or 10 of sales in 2001 as detailed below 

 23 

excluding the effects of the above merger and integration and other expenses above the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales reflects an approximate 43 basis point reduction related to our ability to leverage our store payroll expenses against a higher sales base and an approximate 66 basis point reduction from lower rent expense as a result of owning a higher percentage of stores after the discount acquisition 

interest expense for 2002 was 771 million or 24 of net sales as compared to 610 million or 25 of net sales in 2001 interest expense reflects the overall increase in average borrowings offset by more favorable interest rates during 2002 as compared to 2001 this increase in borrowings is a result of the additional debt incurred in conjunction with the discount acquisition 

income tax expense for 2002 was 395 million as compared to 73 million for 2001 our effective income tax rate decreased to 388 for 2002 as compared to 397 for 2001 the decrease was primarily due to increases in pretax income which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 

during 2002 we recorded 168 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt this loss reflects the writeoff of the ratable portion of the deferred loan costs associated with our partial repayment of our tranche a and tranche b term loans and expenses associated with the refinancing of the remaining portion of our tranche b term loans additionally this loss includes the writeoff of the ratable portion of deferred loan costs and premiums paid associated with the partial repurchase and retirement of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures 

we recorded net income of 650 million 090 per diluted share for 2002 as compared to 114 million or 020 per diluted share for 2001 as a percentage of sales net income for 2002 was 20 as compared to 05 for 2001 the effect of the above merger and integration items and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income is 320 million or 044 per diluted share for 2002 the effect of the 2001 merger and integration expenses loss on extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy and other charges as detailed above were 295 million or 051 per diluted share for 2001 as previously mentioned these per share amounts reflect the twoforone stock split declared in 2003 

quarterly financial results unaudited in thousands except per share data 

 liquidity and capital resources 

at january 3 2004 we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of 4400 million under our senior credit facility additionally we had outstanding borrowings of 50 million under our revolving credit facility and had 326 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to 1224 million 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels inventory requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions we have financed our growth through a combination of cash generated from operations borrowings under the credit facility and issuances of equity 

our new stores if leased require capital expenditures of approximately 150000 per store and an inventory 

investment of approximately 150000 per store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store setup costs and training of new store team members average approximately 25000 per store and are expensed when incurred 

our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year we opened 125 and 110 new stores during 2003 and 2002 respectively including stores acquired in the trak and carport acquisitions but excluding stores acquired in the discount acquisition in addition we anticipate adding approximately 125 to 135 new stores during 2004 primarily through new store openings 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms we anticipate that inventory levels will continue to increase but at a rate lower than anticipated sales growth as recently announced we have launched a vendor factoring program in 2004 that will allow us to extend the terms on a portion of our accounts payable with our suppliers therefore positively impacting cash flow 

our capital expenditures were 1012 million in 2003 these amounts related to the new store openings the upgrade of our information systems remodels and relocations of existing stores including our physical conversion of discount stores and capitalizable store improvements in 2004 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 1300 million up from 2003 reflecting our intent to own rather than lease a portion of our new store openings 

our recent acquisitions have resulted in restructuring reserves recorded in purchase accounting for the closure of certain stores severance and relocation costs and other facility exit costs in addition we assumed certain restructuring and deferred compensation liabilities previously recorded by western and discount at january 3 2004 the restructuring reserves had a remaining balance of 75 million of which 28 million is recorded as a current liability additionally at january 3 2004 the total liability for the deferred compensation plans was 24 million of which 06 million is recorded as a current liability the classification for deferred compensation is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants primarily former western team members which can be changed upon 12 months’ notice these reserves are utilized through the settlement of the corresponding liabilities with cash provided by operations and therefore do not affect our consolidated statement of operations 

we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan at january 3 2004 our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was 174 million the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paidincurred the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarilly determined the discount rate utilized at january 3 2004 and december 28 2002 was 625 and 675 respectively we reserve the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense effective december 2002 we amended the plan to only provide benefits for team members who are eligible at january 1 2005 this negative plan amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of 29 million in 2002 which is being amortized over 12 years to offset corresponding increases in health care cost trends 

we expect that funds provided from operations and available borrowings of approximately 1224 million under our revolving credit facility at january 3 2004 will provide sufficient funds to operate our business make expected capital expenditures of approximately 1300 million in 2004 finance our restructuring activities and fund future debt service on our senior credit facility through the next three years 

for 2003 net cash provided by operating activities was 3559 million of this amount 1249 million was provided by net income and 242 million was provided as a result of a net decrease in working capital other longterm assets and liabilities and other operating activities significant noncash items added back for operating cash purposes include depreciation and amortization of 1007 million amortization of bond discounts and deferred debt issuance costs of 51 million loss on extinguishment of debt of 473 and provision for deferred income taxes of 537 million net cash used in investing activities was 855 million and was comprised primarily of capital expenditures net cash used in financing activities was 2728 million and was comprised primarily of a 2942

in 2001 net cash provided by operating activities was 1035 million this amount consisted of an 114 million in net income depreciation and amortization of 712 million amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount of 146 million impairment of assets held for sale of 123 million amortization of stock option compensation of 117 million and an increase of 177 million of net working capital and other operating activities net cash used in investing activities was 4510 million and was comprised primarily of capital expenditures of 637 million and cash consideration of 3900 million paid in the discount and carport mergers net cash provided by financing activities was 3476 million and was comprised primarily of net borrowings

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” as a result of rescinding fasb statement no 4 “reporting gains losses from extinguishment of debt” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” this statement also amends fasb statement no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we adopted sfas no 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for the fiscal years ended 2003 2002 and 2001 we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of 473 million 168 million and 61 million respectively and appropriately reclassified such amounts 

in september 2002 as subsequently updated in november 2003 the fasb released eitf issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor” this eitf addresses how a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor since eitf issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor’s perspective the consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the vendor’s products or services and should therefore be characterized as a reduction in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer’s income statement unless a reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the vendor’s products in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer’s income statement additionally any rebate or refund should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2002 our current accounting policy for vendor incentives meets the requirements of this eitf and therefore the adoption of this release during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation or fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor’s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued it also clarifies that under certain circumstances a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee certain types of guarantees such as product warranties guarantees accounted for as derivatives and guarantees related to parentsubsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of fin no 45 however they are subject to the disclosure requirements the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 45 are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we have no guarantees of third party indebtedness and therefore the adoption of fin no 45 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations additionally we have complied with the disclosure aspect of fin no 45 as it relates to warranties 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” interpretation no 46 prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved interpretation no 46 is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 we do not have interests in variable interest entities therefore the adoption of interpretation no 46 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” this statement amends sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to allow for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock issued to employees who we refer to as team members this statement also amends fasb no 123 to require disclosure of the accounting method used for valuation in both annual and interim financial statements this statement permits an entity to recognize compensation expense under the prospective method modified prospective method or the retroactive restatement method if an entity elects to adopt this statement fiscal years beginning after december 15 2003 must include this change in accounting for team member stockbased compensation we have adopted the enhanced disclosure requirements of sfas no 148 and accordingly included the related disclosures in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k we have concluded that we will continue to account for team member stockbased compensation in accordance with accounting principles board no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” 

in july 2003 as subsequently updated in november 2003 the fasb released eitf issue no 0310 “application of issue no 0216 by resellers to sales incentives offered to customers by manufacturers” this eitf addresses whether a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement 

by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance with the guidance in eitf issue no 0216 for purposes of this issue the “vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is limited to a vendor’s incentive i that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept manufacturer’s incentives in partial or full of the price charged by the reseller for the vendor’s product ii for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement from the vendor or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor based on the face amount of the incentive iii for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the reseller but rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to consumers and iv whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the vendor whether expressed or implied in the sales incentive transaction between the vendor and the consumer the consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such criteria are not subject to the guidance in issue no 0216 the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after november 25 2003 the company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 

we have increased our store count significantly from 1567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2539 stores at january 3 2004 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates the availability of potential store locations in highly visible welltrafficked areas and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control these include adverse changes in 

  disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors’ operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and other terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

if demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons including 

 if any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

we depend on the services of our existing management team and may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executive officers and senior management team if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management our business could suffer we have entered into employment agreements with some of our executive officers and senior management however these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us additionally we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior executives as needed in the 

future which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including price name recognition customer service and location we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items some of our competitors possess advantages over us including substantially greater financial and marketing resources a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases and more established vendor relationships our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the 

resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions in particular we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to among other things breach of contract anticompetitive behavior tortious conduct employment discrimination asbestos exposure and product defect the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 

risks relating to our financial condition 

our level of debt and restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to take certain actions including obtaining additional financing in the future that we would otherwise consider in our best interest 

at january 3 2004 we had total debt of approximately 4450 million our debt levels could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 31 

our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations our financial and operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 if we are unable to service our debt we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital however we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate also some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies including foreclosing on our assets under those circumstances our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 

the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 

the terms of our amended senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior credit facility furthermore our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable rate debt and hedging activities our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate our future exposure to interest rate risk increased during 2003 due to the addition of variable rate debt and redemption of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures all offset by decreased interest rates a reduction in overall debt levels and the addition of two interest rate swaps 

in march 2003 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 125 million of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 2269 on 75 million of variable rate debt for a term of 36 months the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 179 on 50 million of variable rate debt for a term of 24 months 

in september 2002 we entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zerocost collar which protects us against interest rate fluctuations in the libor rate on 150 million of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility the collar consists of an interest rate ceiling of 45 and an interest floor of 156 for a term of 24 months under this hedge we will continue to pay interest at prevailing rates plus any spread as defined by our credit facility but will be reimbursed for any amounts paid on the libor rate in excess of the ceiling conversely we will be required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the libor rate is less than the 156 floor 

the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our longterm debt outstanding at january 3 2004 by expected maturity dates additionally the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our hedges through their maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january 3 2004 as adjusted by the limitations of the hedge agreement implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

competitive strengths 

we believe our competitive strengths include the following 

leading market position we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry our primary competitors include national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products although the number of competitors and level of competition vary by market both the diy and difm categories are highly fragmented and generally very competitive we enjoy significant advantages over most of our competitors we believe we have strong brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores as a result of our number one position in the majority of our markets based on store count and our significant marketing activities in addition we have purchasing distribution marketing and advertising efficiencies due to our economies of scale in particular our acquisition of discount auto parts in november 2001 has provided us with the leading market position in florida which is especially attractive due to that state’s strong diy customer demographics 

industry leading selection of quality products as the number of automotive replacement parts has proliferated we believe discount stores and mass merchandisers have had increasing difficulties in maintaining a broad inventory selection that diy customers demand we believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty automotive parts retailers like us that have the distribution capacity sophisticated information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer a broad inventory selection to diy customers we offer one of the largest selections of brand name and proprietary automotive parts accessories and maintenance items in the automotive aftermarket industry our stores carry between 16000 and 21000 instore stock keeping units or skus we also offer approximately 105000 additional skus that are available on a sameday or overnight basis through our pdq ® distribution systems including hardertofind replacement parts which typically carry a higher gross margin 

superior customer service  we believe that our customers place significant value on our welltrained sales associates who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and installation and that this differentiates us from mass merchandisers we invest substantial resources in the recruiting and training of our employees who we refer to as team members and provide formal classroom workshops seminars and automotive service excellencetm certification to build technical managerial and customer service skills in addition we recently implemented a new performance management process that will allow us to align each team member’s goals with our strategic corporate goals this process will result in increased team member retention which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction and higher sales and differentiates us from mass merchandisers 

experienced management team with proven track record the 15 members of our senior management team have an average of 11 years experience with us and 14 years in the industry and have successfully grown our company to the second largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the united states our management team has accomplished this using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable store sales opening new stores increasing the penetration of our commercial delivery program and making selective acquisitions 

growth strategy 

our growth strategies consist of the following 

increase our comparable store sales  we have been an industry leader in comparable store sales growth over the last five years averaging 68 annually we plan to increase our comparable store sales in both the diy and difm categories by among other things 1 implementing merchandising and marketing initiatives 2 investing in storelevel systems to enhance our ability to recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per customer 3 refining our store selection and instock availability through customized assortments and other supply chain initiatives 4 continuing to increase customer service through store staffing and retention initiatives and 5 increasing our commercial delivery sales primarily by focusing on key customers to grow average sales per program in particular we intend to continue to make the necessary investments in several applications that are critical to improving our customer service and instock availability we have established strong inventory management systems at the store and distribution center level and have implemented advance parts accessories lookup or apal our new fullyintegrated pointofsale system and electronic parts catalog in approximately onehalf of our stores 

continue to enhance our margins   in addition to driving operating margin expansion via continued strong comparable store sales growth we will continue to focus on increasing margins by 1 improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors 2 utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity 3 leveraging our overall scale to reduce other operating expenses as a percentage of sales and 4 continuing to implement our category management processes and custom mix initiatives 

increase return on invested capital we believe we can continue to successfully increase our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth and increasing our margins we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase inventory turns and selectively expanding our store base in existing markets based on our experience such inmarket openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local management resources we intend to add approximately 125 stores in existing markets in 2003 primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions 

industry 

the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm according to the automotive aftermarket industry association or aaia aftermarket factbook from 1991 to 2001 the diy category grew at a 50 compound annual growth rate from approximately 22 billion to 35 billion this category represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves we believe this category is characterized by stable more recessionresistant demand than most retailers because of the needbased characteristics of the diy category additionally in difficult economic times we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less we also believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer which moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed from 1991 to 2001 the difm category grew at a 64 compound annual growth rate from approximately 36 billion to 68 billion according to the aaia aftermarket factbook this category represents sales to professional installers such as independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less price sensitive or who are less inclined to repair their own vehicles 

we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from several favorable trends including the 

 we believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the industry 

history 

we were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s during the 1980s we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive parts and accessories to diy customers from the 1980s to the present we have grown significantly as a result of strong comparable store sales growth new store openings and strategic acquisitions including our 1998 western auto supply company acquisition and our 2001 acquisition of discount auto parts or discount additionally in 1996 we began to aggressively expand our sales to difm customers by implementing a commercial delivery program 

discount acquisition in november 2001 we acquired discount which was the fifth largest specialty retailer of automotive products to both diy and difm customers in the united states based on store count at november 28 2001 discount had 671 stores operating under the “discount auto parts” trade name in six southern states with 437 of them located in the state of florida during 2002 we completed the conversion of all 164 acquired discount stores located outside the state of florida and in the florida panhandle we also completed the alignment of merchandise offerings in all discount stores in the state of florida to our product offerings physically converted 51 of the florida stores to the new “advance discount auto parts” format and converted approximately half of the florida stores to our store systems during the integration process we closed 109 of the acquired discount locations in overlapping markets with our existing locations 

trak auto parts acquisition during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we entered into and closed on an arrangement to acquire certain assets of trak auto corporation or trak including the leases on 57 stores in virginia washington dc and maryland at december 28 2002 we had converted all 57 stores to the advance auto parts store format and assumed the respective lease obligations 

store operations 

the retail store is the focal point of our operations our stores generally are located in freestanding buildings in high vehicle traffic areas with good visibility and easy access to major roadways our stores typically range in size from 5000 to 10000 square feet with an average of approximately 7500 square feet and offer between 16000 and 21000 skus we also offer approximately 105000 additional skus that are available on a same day or overnight basis through our pdq® and master pdq® systems including hardertofind replacement parts which typically carry a higher gross margin additionally our local area warehouse concept utilizes existing space in selected stores to ensure the availability of certain pdq® items on a sameday basis at december 28 2002 we operated 22 local area warehouses that carried a customized assortment of between 7500 and 12000 skus in addition our proprietary electronic parts catalog enables our sales team to identify an extensive number of applications for the skus that we carry as well as parts that are required by our customers to complete their automotive repair projects replacement parts sold at our stores include radiators brake pads fan belts radiator hoses starters alternators batteries shock absorbers struts cv shafts spark plugs transmission parts clutches electronic ignition components suspension parts engines and transmissions 

our retail stores are company operated and divided into five areas a senior vice president who is supported by regional vice presidents manages each area division managers report to the regional vice presidents and have direct responsibility for store operations in a specific division which typically consists of 10 to 15 stores depending on store size and sales volume each store is staffed by 8 to 30 team members under the leadership of a store manager stores generally are open from 800 am to 900 pm six days a week and 900 am to 600 pm on sundays 

total stores  our 2435 retail stores were located in the following states and territories at december 28 2002 

 the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the number of our stores during the past five years 

 purchasing and merchandising 

virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel at our corporate offices in roanoke virginia in addition specialty merchandise for our wholesale segment and our western auto retail stores is purchased in our kansas city missouri office in 2002 we purchased merchandise from over 200 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 8 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating multiyear agreements with certain vendors which allows us to achieve more favorable terms and pricing accordingly in connection with the discount acquisition and our resulting increased volume we were able to renegotiate several longterm agreements that provided more favorable terms and pricing 

our purchasing team is currently led by a group of six senior professionals who have an average of over 16 

years of automotive purchasing experience and over 20 years in retail this team is skilled in sourcing products globally and maintaining high quality levels while streamlining costs associated with the handling of merchandise through the supply chain the purchasing team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and is involved currently in implementing a “bestinclass” category management process to improve comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns 

our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as monroe bendix purolator and ac delco which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial delivery customers in addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories we are currently in the process of customizing our product mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store based on that store’s historical and projected sales mix and regionally specific customer needs 

advertising 

we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings product assortment competitive prices free services battery installation and wiper replacements and commitment to customer service the program is focused on establishing us as the solution for a customer’s automotive needs we utilize a media blend that reinforces our brand image including print promotional signage television radio and outdoor media plus our proprietary instore television network and internet site 

our advertising plan is based on a monthly program built around a promotional theme and a seasonally relevant product campaign the plan is supported by print and instore signage our television advertising is a combination of regional and national media focused to sports programming radio advertising which is used as a supplementary medium generally airs during peak drive times we also sponsor sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots effort to positively impact individual communities including hispanic and other ethnic communities to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 

in february 2003 we launched our new advertising campaign “we’re ready in advance” we believe this advertising campaign differentiates advance in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring positive image of advance as a special place to shop 

management information systems 

we have developed a flexible technology infrastructure that supports our growth strategy our information technology infrastructure is comprised of software and hardware designed to integrate store distribution and vendor services into a seamless network all stores corporate and regional offices and distribution centers are linked via a communications network which is based on frame relay technology our stores in puerto rico are linked to the communications network via satellite electronic documents transferred between us and our vendors expedite the ordering receiving and merchandise payment processes we expect to complete the implementation of our technology platform into the discount auto parts stores and the lakeland distribution center including the administrative offices in 2003 

enterprise information system 

our management team has online access to certain financial information via hyperion analyzer a webenabled frontend tool which retrieves information from our hyperion essbase database this system which is tightly integrated to our “best in class” peoplesoft financial and human resource systems helps ensure that accurate consistent and timely financial information is available to all levels of management including our sales margin payroll and other key metrics this system assists the management team in planning and responding to our business 

and industry trends quickly and costeffectively this system contains analysis tools that provide our management the ability to rank and rate their operations and identify “best practices” opportunities for business improvement 

store based information systems 

our store based information systems which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of pointofsale or pos electronic parts catalog or epc storelevel inventory management and store intranet or storenet systems additionally we support store level operations with our management planning and training and customer contact systems these systems are integrated tightly and together provide real time comprehensive information to store and merchandising personnel resulting in improved customer service levels team member utilization and instock availability we have completely implemented our store based information systems into all of the discount stores located outside of the florida market including the florida panhandle and plan to complete the implementation of the discount stores located in the florida market in 2003 

pointofsale  our pos system is used to formulate pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly we have fully implemented our new pos system or apal in one half of our stores and are in the process of implementing apal in the remaining half of our stores apal is designed to improve customer checkout time and decrease the time required to train newlyhired team members in addition apal will provide additional customer purchase history which may be used for customer demographic analysis 

electronic parts catalog  our epc system is a software system that enables our store team members to identify over 40 million application uses for automotive parts and accessories the epc system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year make model and engine type of their vehicle if a hardtofind part or accessory is not available at one of our stores the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our pdq® express system the epc system also enables our store team members to identify additional parts that are required by our customers to complete their automotive repair projects this generally leads to an increase in average sales per transaction the integration of this system with our pos system improves customer service by reducing time spent at the cash register and fully automating the sales process between the parts counter and our pos register this system enables store team members to order parts and accessories electronically through our pdq® express system with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time additionally information about a customer’s automobile can be entered into a permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits or telephones one of our stores 

in conjunction with the rollout of apal we are also enhancing our epc system in our stores the enhanced epc system which is fully integrated with apal will provide the capability of cataloging nonapplication specific parts and additional product information such as technical service bulletins installation instructions images of parts and related diagrams of automotive systems the enhanced epc system contains enhanced search engines and more userfriendly navigation tools that enhance our store team members’ ability to lookup any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project we believe these components will enhance our customers’ shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair job the first time saving them time and money 

to ensure ongoing improvement of epc information in all stores we have developed a centrally based epc data management system that enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalogue and deliver updated accurate product information to our stores additionally we are enhancing the epc system to provide additional methods of parts lookup while reducing keystrokes and allowing our store team members to more efficiently serve our customers 

store level inventory management system  our storelevel inventory management system provides realtime inventory tracking at the store level with the storelevel system store team members can check the quantity of onhand inventory for any sku adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate sku’s for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers in conjunction with the rollout of apal we are also implementing radio frequency hand held devices in all of our stores which will help ensure the accuracy of inventory 

store intranet  installed in june of 1998 our storenet system delivers product information electronic manuals forms store operating results instore training opportunities and internal communications to all store team members in addition storenet provides online tools that enhance the productivity of our team members as follows 

 management planning and training   mpt is our proprietary system designed to streamline our store labor management and training processes mpt gives our store managers the tools to plan for peak customer traffic to ensure we have knowledgeable and friendly sales people in our stores and wellstocked shelves to meet our customers’ needs after a thorough review of all our store processes we believe mpt improves our results of operations through industryleading labor utilization on all store labor events including sales training and unloading of weekly product deliveries 

customer contact center  in 2001 we installed new call routing software and customer service software established a customer contact center in roanoke virginia and consolidated all support centers implementation of the customer contact center has resulted in a substantial improvement in the average speed in which in a call is answered a reduction in calls to voice mail and a reduction in the number of outbound calls required to respond to voice mail we believe these improvements have allowed us to better support each of our stores therefore increasing customer service 

logistics and purchasing information systems 

distribution center management system  our distribution management system or dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the dcms integrated with material handling equipment significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency seven of our eight distribution facilities currently use this technology and we anticipate that the eighth distribution facility which we acquired as part of the discount acquisition will be converted to this technology in 2003 additionally fourteen of our nineteen pdq® express facilities currently use this technology and we expect the remaining five pdq® express facilities will be converted to this technology in 2003 

replenishment systems  our e3 replenishment system monitors the distribution center and pdq® express warehouse inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate in addition the system tracks sales trends by sku allowing us to adjust future orders to support seasonal and demographic shifts in demand during 2001 we completed the implementation of a storelevel replenishment version of e3 for our advance auto parts stores and as discount stores are converted to our new pos system e3 replenishment is being implemented in those stores 

transportation management system  our transportation management system is an effective planning tool that allows for the efficient management of incoming shipments benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain the reduction in distribution center inventory or safety stock due to consistent transit times and decreased third party freight and 

billing service costs

general 

at december 28 2002 we had 2000 stores operating under the “advance auto parts” trade name in 37 states in the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states additionally we operated 51 stores under the “advance discount auto parts” trade name and 347 stores operating under the “discount auto parts” trade name in florida we also had 37 stores operating under the “western auto” trade name primarily located in puerto rico and the virgin islands we operate in the united states automotive aftermarket industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickups vans minivans and sport utility vehicles we are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items to diy customers in the united states based on store count and sales we currently are the largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the majority of the states in which we operate based on store count 

our combined operations are conducted in two operating segments retail and wholesale the retail segment consists of our retail operations operating under the trade names “advance auto parts” “advance discount auto parts” and “discount auto parts” in the united states and “western auto” primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands our wholesale segment includes a wholesale distribution network which provides distribution services of automotive parts accessories and specialty items to approximately 415 independently owned dealer stores in 42 states primarily operating under the “western auto” trade name our wholesale operations accounted for 

approximately 25 of our net sales for the year ended december 28 2002 

acquisitions 

trak auto parts acquisition in july 2002 we announced we had received bankruptcy court approval to acquire certain assets of trak including the leases on 55 stores in virginia washington dc and maryland in september 2002 we agreed to acquire two additional trak stores we believe the trak acquisition gave us the number one market position based on store count in the washington dcbaltimore area with 57 stores the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly each store’s results of operations has been included in our financial statements from the date each store was transferred to us negative goodwill of 17 million resulting from excess fair value over the purchase price was allocated proportionately as a reduction to certain noncurrent assets as of december 28 2002 we had taken ownership and converted all 57 stores to the advance auto parts store format assumed the respective lease obligations and had paid 125 million for inventory and fixtures 

discount acquisition  on november 28 2001 we acquired discount in a transaction in which discount’s shareholders received 750 per share in cash or approximately 1285 million in the aggregate plus 02577 shares of our common stock for each share of discount common stock we issued approximately 43 million shares of our common stock to the former discount shareholders which represented 132 of our total shares outstanding immediately following the acquisition at november 28 2001 discount had 671 stores in six states including the leading market position in florida based on store count with 437 stores the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting accordingly the results of operations for discount for the periods from december 2 2001 are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values negative goodwill of 757 million resulting from total excess fair value over the purchase price was allocated proportionately as a reduction to noncurrent assets primarily property and equipment during 2002 we reduced negative goodwill by 170 million due to purchase accounting adjustments primarily made to adjust the fair market value of certain inventory equipment the related deferred income tax effects and to reduce certain severance and relocation liabilities 

during 2002 we integrated all of the 164 acquired discount stores located outside the state of florida and in the florida panhandle this conversion included both a system conversion to our store system and a physical conversion to the “advance auto parts” store format and merchandise offerings we also completed the alignment of merchandise offerings in all discount stores in the state of florida to our product offerings physically converted 51 of the florida stores and converted approximately half of the florida stores to our store systems the physically converted stores have undergone the complete conversion to the new “advance discount auto parts” format we anticipate completing the store system conversions by the end of 2003 the physical conversion will continue through fiscal 2005 during the integration we closed 109 discount stores in overlapping markets with our existing stores 

critical accounting policies 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of these accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of the financial statements as discussed above 

vendor incentives 

we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates and other functional discounts many of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while others are negotiated on an annual basis our vendors require us to use certain cooperative advertising allowances 

exclusively for advertising we define these allowances as restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses as advertising expenditures are incurred the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors or unrestricted rebates and other functional incentives are earned based on purchases andor the sale of the product amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets included in the financial statements in part iv item 15 of this report we record unrestricted cooperative advertising and volume rebates earned as a reduction of inventory and recognize the incentives as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold shortterm incentives are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreement term and are not recorded as reductions to inventory 

we recognize the other functional discounts earned related to longterm agreements as a reduction to cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing of purchases these incentives are not recorded as reductions to inventory the functional amounts earned under longterm arrangements are based on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned the incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates but over the life of the contract would be the same 

inventory 

inventory shrink reserves are recorded related to our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our estimates related to these shrink reserves depend on the effectiveness of the cycle counting programs we evaluate the effectiveness of these programs on an ongoing basis and believe they provide reasonable assurance for the recorded reserves 

reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal in addition we have historically been able to return excess items to the vendor for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 

warranties 

our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendors’ warranties include batteries tires roadside assistance and craftsman products we record accruals for future warranty claims based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in our estimates may be required we have recently seen positive trends in the defective rates of our batteries sold which have offset historically higher trends used to develop our battery warranty accrual we believe these positive trends are a result of quality enhancements of our currently offered battery line and better policies and procedures surrounding the testing and defecting of batteries by our store personnel 

restructuring and closed store liabilities 

we recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a decision is made to close a store location and includes future minimum lease payments common area maintenance and taxes additionally we make certain assumptions related to potential subleases and lease buyouts that reduce the recorded amount of the accrual these assumptions are based on our knowledge of the market and the relevant experience however the inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves 

contingencies 

we accrue for obligations including estimated legal costs when it is probable and the amount is reasonably 

estimable as facts concerning contingencies become known we reassess our position both with respect to gain contingencies and accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates that are particularly sensitive to future change include tax environmental and legal matters which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 

components of statement of operations

cost of sales 

our cost of sales includes merchandise costs and warehouse and distribution expenses as well as service labor costs of our western auto stores gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous

during 2002 we opened 110 new stores including the 57 stores from the trak acquisition relocated 39 stores and closed 159 stores 133 of which were related to the discount acquisition bringing the total number of retail stores to 2435 as of december 28 2002 we had 1411 stores participating in our commercial delivery program as a result of adding 41 net programs during 2002 additionally as of december 28 2002 we supplied approximately

interest expense for 2002 was 782 million or 24 of net sales as compared to 619 million or 25 of net sales in 2001 interest expense reflects the overall increase in average borrowings offset by more favorable interest rates during 2002 as compared to 2001 this increase in borrowings is a result of the additional debt incurred in conjunction with the discount acquisition 

income tax expense for 2002 was 480 million as compared to 113 million for 2001 our effective income tax rate decreased to 388 for 2002 as compared to 397 for 2001 the decrease was primarily due to increases in pretax income which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 

during 2002 we recorded 104 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt net of tax this loss reflects the writeoff of the ratable portion of the deferred loan costs associated with our partial repayment of our tranche a and tranche b term loans and expenses associated with the refinancing of the remaining portion of our tranche b term loans additionally this loss includes the writeoff of the ratable portion of deferred loan costs and premiums paid associated with the partial repurchase and retirement of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures

wholesale segment decreased 228 million due to a decline in the number of dealer stores we serviced and lower average sales to each dealer 

during 2001 we opened 110 new stores including the 30 net stores from the carport acquisition in april 2001 relocated 18 stores and closed 24 stores additionally we acquired 671 stores in the discount acquisition in november 2001 and closed two of these stores in december 2001 bringing the total number of stores to 2484 we increased the number of our stores participating in our commercial delivery program to 1370 primarily as a result of adding 167 discount stores with existing commercial delivery programs additionally as of december 29 2001 we supplied approximately 470 independent dealers through the wholesale dealer network 

gross profit for 2001 was 10669 million or 424 of net sales as compared to 8959 million or 392 of net sales in 2000 the change in accounting principle accounted for approximately 220 basis points of the increase with the remaining increase attributable to positive shifts in product mix the fiscal 2001 83 million net gain recorded as a reduction to cost of sales during the first quarter of 2001 as a result of a vendor contract settlement was equally offset by higher cost of sales during the last three quarters of 2001 as a result of the new supplier contract additionally 2001 gross profit included a nonrecurring charge of 91 million or 04 of sales related to restocking and handling fees associated with the return of inventory as a result of supply chain initiatives the gross profit for the retail segment was 10529 million or 435 of net sales for 2001 as compared to 8810 million or 407 of net sales in 2000

 excluding the effects of the above merger and integration and nonrecurring expenses the remaining increase consisted of 220 basis points related to the change in accounting principle 55 basis points related to our increased investment in store staffing and retention initiatives which were put in place in the third quarter of 2000 and 20 basis points related to higher insurance costs due to adverse changes in the insurance market 

interest expense for 2001 was 619 million or 25 of net sales as compared to 666 million or 29 of net sales in 2000 the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in average interest rates over 2000

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 28 2002 we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of 878 million of senior discount debentures 3149 million of senior subordinated notes and borrowings of 3311 million under our senior credit facility additionally we had borrowed 17 million under our revolving credit facility and had 171 million in letters of credit outstanding which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to 1412 million 

our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program including new store openings and store acquisitions store relocations and remodels inventory requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions we have financed our growth through a combination of cash generated from operations borrowings under the credit facility and issuances of equity 

our new stores if leased require capital expenditures of approximately 120000 per store and an inventory investment of approximately 150000 per store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store setup costs and training of new store team members average approximately 25000 per store and are expensed when incurred 

our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year we opened 110 new stores during each of 2002 and 2001 including stores acquired in the trak and carport acquisitions but excluding stores acquired in the discount acquisition in addition we anticipate adding approximately 125 new stores during 2003 through new store openings and selective acquisitions 

historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms we anticipate that inventory levels will continue to increase primarily as a result of new store openings 

our capital expenditures were 982 million in 2002 excluding consideration paid in the trak acquisition these amounts related to the new store openings the upgrade of our information systems including our new pointofsale and electronic parts catalog system and remodels and relocations of existing stores including our conversion of discount stores in 2003 we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately 950 million of which approximately 120 million will involve the continued conversion of stores associated with the discount acquisition 

as part of normal operations we continually monitor store performance which results in our closing or relocating certain store locations that do not meet profitability objectives during 2002 we closed or relocated 11 of the 12 stores identified in 2001 as not meeting profitability objectives and decided to close or relocate 57 additional stores that did not meet profitability objectives 36 of which were closed or relocated at december 28 2002 in addition as part of our integration of discount we have closed 133 advance auto parts and discount stores that were in overlapping markets 

our recent acquisitions have resulted in restructuring reserves recorded in purchase accounting for the closure of certain stores severance and relocation costs and other facility exit costs in addition we assumed certain restructuring and deferred compensation liabilities previously recorded by western and discount at december 28 2002 the restructuring reserves had a remaining balance of 132 million of which 60 million is recorded as a current liability additionally at december 28 2002 the total liability for the deferred compensation plans was 39 million of which 16 million is recorded as a current liability the classification for deferred compensation is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants primarily former western team members which can be changed upon 12 months’ notice these reserves are utilized through the settlement of the corresponding liabilities with cash provided by operations and therefore do not affect our consolidated statement of operations 

we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan at december 28 2002 our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was 191 million the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paidincurred the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarily determined the discount rate utilized at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 was 675 and 750 respectively we reserve the right to change or terminate the 

benefits or contributions at any time we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense effective december 2002 we amended our plan to only include benefits for team members who are eligible at january 1 2005 this negative plan amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of 29 million which will be amortized over 12 years to offset corresponding increases in health care cost trends 

we expect that funds provided from operations and available borrowings of approximately 1412 million under our revolving credit facility at december 28 2002 will provide sufficient funds to operate our business make expected capital expenditures of approximately 950 million in 2003 finance our restructuring activities and fund future debt service on our senior subordinated notes our senior discount debentures and our credit facility over the next 12 months we recently announced our intention to redeem all our currently outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures on april 15 2003 the capital requirements to complete this retirement will be funded by incremental borrowings of 350 million under our amended senior credit facility and cash flow from operations during our first quarter of fiscal 2003 in connection with the redemption and incremental borrowings we expect to pay cash call premiums and refinancing expenses of approximately 27 million and unamortized discounts of approximately 10 million 

for 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was 2430 million of this amount 650 million was provided by net income and 94 million was provided as a result of a net decrease in working capital and other longterm assets and liabilities significant noncash items added back for operating cash purposes include depreciation and amortization of 941 million amortization of bond discounts and deferred debt issuance costs of 166 million and provision for deferred income taxes of 579 million net cash used for investing activities was 780 million and was comprised primarily of capital expenditures net cash used in financing activities was 1692 million and was comprised primarily of 2233 million in net payments on the credit facility and payments to repurchase and retire outstanding bonds and a decrease in bank overdrafts of 339 million all offset by 887 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in march 2002 and 174 million in proceeds from team member exercises of stock options additionally in november 2002 we repurchased the entire 10 million of indebtedness under the industrial development revenue bonds

the interest rates on the tranche a and a1 term loan facilities the revolving credit facility and the tranche c and c1 term loan facilities are based at our option on either an adjusted libor rate plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin under our senior credit facility as amended in march 2003 until our delivery of our financial statements for our third fiscal quarter ending on october 4 2003 the initial margins for the tranche a and a1 term loan facilities the tranche c and c1 term loan facilities and the revolving facility are 275 and 175 per annum for the adjusted libor rate and alternate base rate borrowings respectively the margins subsequent to such date will be determined by a pricing grid based on our leverage ratio at that time if our leverage ratio reduces to greater than or equal to 150 to 100 and less than 200 to 100 the margin applicable to each of the facilities will step down to a libor spread of 250 per annum and down to 225 per annum if we achieve a

redemption of indebtedness  on march 14 2003 we called for redemption on april 15 2003 all of our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures these redemptions will be funded with borrowings under our amended senior credit facility and cash on hand 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to 

enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 141 “business combinations” and no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 141 addresses accounting and reporting for all business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method for business combinations sfas no 141 also requires recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet certain criteria sfas no 142 establishes accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 142 goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are instead subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test sfas no 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 sfas no 142 is effective for existing goodwill and intangible assets beginning as of december 30 2001 sfas no 142 is effective immediately for goodwill and intangibles acquired after june 30 2001 for fiscal year 2001 we had amortization expense of approximately 444 related to existing goodwill of 3251 at december 29 2001 such amortization has been eliminated upon adoption of sfas no 142 we implemented sfas no 142 during the first quarter of 2002 the implementation had no material impact on our financial position or the results of our operations 

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” sfas no 143 establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost this statement applies to all entities that have legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal use of the assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 we do not expect sfas no 143 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in august 2001 the fasb also issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment and disposal of longlived assets” this statement replaces both sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and accounting principles board or apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations—reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” sfas no 144 retains the basic provisions from both sfas no 121 and apb no 30 but includes changes to improve financial reporting and comparability among entities the provisions of sfas no 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 we adopted sfas no 144 during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 with no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” as a result of rescinding fasb statement no 4 “reporting gains losses from extinguishment of debt” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb no 30 this statement also amends fasb statement no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 for 2002 we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt net of tax of 104 million accordingly reclassifications of this loss to income from continuing operations will be made throughout fiscal 2003 to maintain comparability for the reported periods 

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities” this statement nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of at the date an entity commits to an exit plan the statement is effective for exit and disposal activities entered into after december 31 2002 we do not expect adopting this 

statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in september 2002 as subsequently updated in november the fasb released eitf issue no 0216 “accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor” this eitf addresses how a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor since eitf issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer” only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor’s perspective the consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the vendor’s products or services and should therefore be characterized as a reduction in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer’s income statement unless a reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the vendor’s products in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer’s income statement additionally any rebate or refund should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2002 we believe our current accounting policy for vendor incentives meets the requirements of this eitf and therefore we do not expect adopting this release will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” this statement amends sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to allow for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock issued to team members this statement also amends fasb no 123 to require disclosure of the accounting method used for valuation in both annual and interim financial statements this statement permits an entity to recognize compensation expense under the prospective method modified prospective method or the retroactive restatement method if an entity elects to adopt this statement fiscal years beginning after december 15 2003 must include this change in accounting for stockbased team member compensation we are currently evaluating the effect of voluntarily adopting the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 and will elect a transition method if the fair value method is adopted 

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this interpretation sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor’s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued it also clarifies that under certain circumstances a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee certain types of guarantees such as product warranties guarantees accounted for as derivatives and guarantees related to parentsubsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of interpretation no 45 however they are subject to the disclosure requirements the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 45 are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we have no guarantees of third party indebtedness and do not believe the adoption of these new rules will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” interpretation no 46 prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved interpretation no 46 is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 we do not have interests in variable interest entities and do not believe the adoption of interpretation no 46 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 

we have increased our store count significantly from 1567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2435 stores at december 28 2002 we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things our ability to manage the expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates the availability of potential store locations in highly visible welltrafficked areas and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products required in their respective markets 

furthermore we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions investments strategic alliances or related efforts 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our return on capital which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales enhance our margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control these include adverse changes in 

 disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors’ operations could increase our cost of goods sold 

our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and other terms many factors outside of our 

control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them in addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher prices 

if demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons including 

 if any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

we depend on the services of our existing management team and may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 

our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executive officers and senior management team if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management our business could suffer we have entered into employment agreements with some of our executive officers and senior management however these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us additionally we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior executives as needed in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the retail automotive parts industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

the retail sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including price name recognition customer service and location we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items some of our competitors possess advantages over us including substantially greater financial and marketing resources a larger number of stores longer operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established customer bases and more established vendor relationships our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions in particular we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to among other things breach of contract anticompetitive behavior tortious conduct employment discrimination asbestos exposure and product defect the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim it could have a material adverse affect on our business and 

operating results 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters environmental protection and building and zoning requirements if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 

we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of discount which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we acquired discount to capitalize on its leading market position in florida to increase our store base in our southeastern markets and to create the opportunity for potential cost savings through operational synergies achieving the expected benefits of the discount acquisition will depend in large part on our completion of the integration of discount’s operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner some of the objectives we still need to accomplish include 

 if we cannot successfully complete the integration of discount our ability to manage discount’s business effectively and profitably could suffer in addition key team members may leave and customer service standards could deteriorate moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and discount’s business as it will divert the attention of management from its normal operational responsibilities and duties our failure to successfully complete the integration of discount could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our financial condition 

our level of debt and restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to take certain actions including obtaining additional financing in the future that we would otherwise consider in our best interest 

we currently have a significant amount of debt at december 28 2002 we had total debt of approximately 7355 million our high level of debt could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 

we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations our financial and 

operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include 

 if we are unable to service our debt we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital however we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate also some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility the holders of our senior subordinated notes and the holders of our senior discount debentures and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies including foreclosing on our assets under those circumstances our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 

the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 

the terms of our amended senior credit facility and the indentures for our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including 

 the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our indentures and other debt agreements furthermore our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio which if not maintained by us will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility any of these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable rate debt our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor prime federal funds and base cd rates 

  our future exposure to interest rate risk decreased during 2002 due to decreased interest rates and reduced variable rate debt additionally during 2002 we entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zerocost collar which will protect against interest rate fluctuations in the libor rate on 150 million of our variable rate debt the collar consists of an interest rate ceiling of 45 and an interest rate floor of 156 for a term of twentyfour months under this hedge agreement we continue to pay interest at prevailing rates plus any spread as defined by our credit facility but are reimbursed for any amounts paid on the libor rate in excess of the ceiling accordingly we are 

required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the libor rate is less than the 156 floor 

  in march 2003 and in conjunction with the restatement and amending of our senior credit facility we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of 125 million of our variable rate debt the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 2269 thereby limiting our cash flow risk on 75 million of debt for a term of 36 months the remaining swap allows us to fix our libor rate at 179 limiting our cash flow risk on an additional 50 million of debt for a term of 24 months 

  the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on longterm debt we had outstanding at december 28 2002 by expected maturity dates expected maturity dates approximate contract terms fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december 28 2002 implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates

page

retailer of automotive products in the majority of the states in which we
currently operate based on store count we had 2444 stores operating under
the advance auto parts and discount auto parts trade names in 37 states in
the northeastern southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states at
december 29 2001 in addition as of that date we had 40 stores operating
under the western auto trade name located in puerto rico the virgin islands
and california our stores offer a broad selection of brand name and private
label automotive products for domestic and imported cars and light trucks our
stores average approximately 7500 square feet in size and carry between 16000
and 21000 stock keeping units or skus we also offer approximately 105000
additional skus that are available on a same day or overnight basis through our
parts delivered quickly or pdqr distribution systems in addition to our
diy business we serve doitforme or difm customers via sales to
commercial accounts sales to difm customers represented approximately 15 of
our retail sales in 2001 we also operate a wholesale distribution network
which offers automotive parts accessories and certain other merchandise to
approximately 470 independentlyowned dealer stores in 44 states our wholesale
operations accounted for approximately 39 of our net sales in 2001

   since 1997 we have achieved significant growth through a combination of
comparable store sales growth new store openings increased penetration of our
commercial delivery program and strategic acquisitions from 1997 through 2001
we

      increased our store count at yearend from 814 to 2484

      achieved positive comparable store sales growth in every quarter and
       averaged 69 annually

      increased our net sales at a compound annual growth rate of 388 from
       8481 million to 31 billion pro forma for the discount acquisition
       and

      increased our ebitda as adjusted see item 6 selected financial data
       at a compound annual growth rate of 399 from 684 million to
       2619 million pro forma for the discount acquisition

   in 2001 our comparable store sales growth was 62 in addition our
ebitda as adjusted see item 6 selected financial data for 2001 increased
234 to 1997 million from 1619 million for 2000

   we believe that our sales growth has exceeded the industry average as a
result of our industry leading selection of quality brand name and private
label products at competitive prices our strong name recognition and our high
levels of customer service in addition we believe our large size provides
numerous competitive advantages over smaller retail chains and independent
operators which together generate the majority of the sales in the automotive
aftermarket industry these advantages include 1 greater product
availability 2 purchasing distribution and marketing efficiencies 3 a
greater number of convenient locations with longer store hours and 4 the
ability to invest heavily in employee training and information systems

industry

   we operate within the large and growing us automotive aftermarket
industry which includes replacement parts excluding tires accessories
maintenance items batteries and automotive fluids for cars and light trucks
pickup trucks vans minivans and sport utility vehicles based on data from
the us department of commerce sales in the automotive aftermarket industry
excluding tires and labor costs increased at a compound annual growth rate of
60 between 1991 and 2000 from approximately 58 billion to 98 billion

   the automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major
categories diy and difm from 1991 to 2000 the diy category grew at a 58
compound annual growth rate from 22 billion to 36 billion this category
represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves we
believe this category is characterized by stable recessionresistant demand
because the diy customer is more likely to delay a new vehicle purchase during
a recession in addition in difficult economic times we believe people tend
to drive more and use air travel less from 1991 to 2000 the difm category
grew at a 60 compound annual growth rate from 36 billion to 62 billion
this category represents sales to professional installers such as

                                      2

page

independent garages service stations and auto dealers difm parts and services
are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less price sensitive or who are
less inclined to repair their own vehicles

   we believe the us automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit
from several favorable trends including the

      increasing number and age of vehicles in the united states increasing
       number of miles driven annually increasing number of cars coming off of
       warranty particularly leased vehicles

      higher cost of replacement parts as a result of technological changes in
       recent models of vehicles and increasing number of light trucks and
       sport utility vehicles that require more expensive parts resulting in
       higher average sales per customer and

      continued consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers resulting
       in a reduction in the number of stores in the marketplace and enhanced
       profitability and returns on capital

   we believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store
sales growth in the industry

   we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket
industry our primary competitors include national and regional retail
automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators
automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers
that carry automotive products although the number of competitors and level of
competition vary by market both the diy and difm categories are highly
fragmented and generally very competitive however as the number of automotive
replacement parts has proliferated we believe discount stores and mass
merchandisers have had increasing difficulties in maintaining a broad inventory
selection and providing the service levels that diy customers demand we
believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty
automotive parts retailers like us that have the distribution capacity
sophisticated information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer
a broad inventory selection to diy customers as a result according to lang
marketing resources a market research firm specialty automotive parts
retailers have increased their market share of diy sales significantly from
approximately 26 in 1990 to 41 in 2000 primarily by taking market share from
discount stores and mass merchandisers

history

   we were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise
until the 1980s during the 1980s we sharpened our focus to target sales of
automotive parts and accessories to diy customers from the 1980s to the
present we have grown significantly as a result of strong comparable store
sales growth new store openings and strategic acquisitions in 1996 we began
to aggressively expand our sales to difm customers by implementing a commercial
delivery program our commercial delivery program includes marketing that is
specifically designed to attract difm customers and consists of the delivery of
automotive parts and accessories to professional installers such as
independent garages service stations and auto dealers

   the recapitalization  in april 1998 freeman spogli  co and ripplewood
partners lp acquired a majority ownership interest in us through a
recapitalization freeman spogli  co and ripplewood purchased an 80
ownership interest in us and our management purchased a 6 ownership interest
in the recapitalization nicholas f taubman and the arthur taubman trust our
existing shareholders retained a 14 ownership interest in us

   western acquisition  in november 1998 we acquired western from sears
roebuck and co western operated over 600 stores under the parts america and
western auto trade names as well as a wholesale distribution network as
consideration sears received approximately 115 million shares of our common
stock which was valued at 193 million and 185 million in cash in addition
freeman spogli  co ripplewood

                                      3

nicholas f taubman and the arthur taubman trust made an additional 70 million
equity investment in us to fund a portion of the purchase price the remaining
cash portion of the purchase price was funded through additional borrowings
under our prior credit facility

   carport acquisition  in april 2001 we acquired the assets of carport
including 30 stores net of closures in alabama and mississippi the
acquisition made us the market leader in alabama and continued our new store
development program in alabama and mississippi without adding new stores to the
market

   discount acquisition  in november 2001 we acquired discount which was the
fifth largest specialty retailer of automotive products to both diy and difm
customers in the united states based on store count at november 28 2001
discount had 671 stores operating under the discount auto parts trade name in
six states with 437 stores in florida 120 stores in georgia 46 stores in
louisiana 42 stores in mississippi 19 stores in alabama and seven stores in
south carolina for 2001 discount generated net sales and ebitda of 6617
million and 657 million since discounts inception in 1971 members of the
fontaine family including herman fontaine denis l fontaine and peter j
fontaine have managed discount and played key roles in formulating and
carrying out its business strategies peter j fontaine who has been with
discount for over 26 years and previously served as chief operating officer
was elected as president and chief executive officer in 1994 and continued to
hold the position of chief executive officer until january 2002 at the closing
of the discount acquisition peter j fontaine became a member of our board of
directors

   our combined operations are conducted in two operating segments retail and
wholesale the retail segment consists of our retail operations operating under
the trade names advance auto parts and discount auto parts in the united
states and western auto in puerto rico the virgin islands and one store in
california our wholesale segment includes the wholesale distribution network
acquired in the western merger

benefits of the discount acquisition

   as a result of our successful integration of prior acquisitions we believe
that we have established a proven model that will enable us to integrate
discount successfully our integration of western included the conversion of
the acquired stores net of closures to the advance auto parts format and
name and the addition of 39 western auto stores located primarily in puerto
rico and the virgin islands and a wholesale distribution network that supplies
independent dealer stores that license the western auto trade name we
converted successfully the 545 parts america stores in 11 months more than six
months ahead of our schedule including physical renovation store systems
conversions and inventory mix changes largely due to increasing economies of
scale that we were able to obtain primarily from existing vendors following
this acquisition we increased our gross margin on a companywide basis from
364 for 1999 to 392 for 2000 in april 2001 we acquired 30 carport stores
net of closures in alabama and mississippi the conversion of carport stores
to the advance auto parts format and name which began in late may was
completed in six weeks comparable store sales growth for these stores was
266 for the period from the end of the conversion on july 7 2001 through
december 29 2001

   we expect to realize the following benefits from our acquisition of discount

   strengthened position within target markets  our acquisition of discount
has provided us with the leading market position in florida where discount had
437 stores at november 28 2001 which is especially attractive due to the
states strong diy customer demographics the florida market has a favorable
climate that allows for yearround maintenance and repair of vehicles has a
population growth rate that exceeds the national average and is ranked third in
the united states in terms of registrations of cars and light trucks this
acquisition also further solidified our leading position throughout the
southeast at november 28 2001 discount had an additional 234 stores in five
other southeastern states in which we currently operate and which are part of
our core markets

                                      4

page

   improved purchasing distribution and administrative efficiencies  we
expect to achieve ongoing purchasing distribution and administrative savings
as a result of the discount acquisition purchasing savings will be derived
primarily through economies of scale we also expect to achieve significant
savings from the optimization of our combined distribution network including
more efficient capacity utilization at discounts mississippi distribution
center and from the reduction of overlapping administrative functions during
2002 we expect these savings to result in approximately 30 million of
incremental ebitda excluding onetime integration expenses

   opportunity to increase discounts store sales  we plan to increase
discounts store sales by among other things 1 remerchandising stores to
increase parts availability and instock position 2 increasing customer
service and improving store execution through staffing and training
initiatives 3 enhancing existing commercial delivery programs and
selectively adding new programs and 4 refurbishing the store layout and
appearance

competitive strengths

   we believe our competitive strengths include the following

   leading market position  we are the second largest specialty retailer of
automotive products to diy customers in the united states based on store count
and sales our acquisition of discount further solidified this position and
provides us with additional critical mass in our existing markets particularly
in the rapidly growing southeast we enjoy significant competitive advantages
over smaller retail chains and independent operators we believe we have strong
brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores as a result of our number
one position in the majority of our markets based on store count and our
significant marketing activities in addition we have purchasing distribution
and marketing efficiencies due to our economies of scale as the number of
makes and models of vehicles continues to increase we believe we will continue
to have a significant competitive advantage as many of these competitors may
not have the resources including management information systems purchasing
power or distribution capabilities required to stock and deliver a broad
selection of brand name and private label automotive products at competitive
prices

   industry leading selection of quality products  we offer one of the largest
selections of brand name and private label automotive parts accessories and
maintenance items in the automotive aftermarket industry our stores carry
between 16000 and 21000 instore skus we also offer approximately 105000
additional skus that are available on a sameday or overnight basis through our
pdqr distribution systems including hardertofind replacement parts which
typically carry a higher gross margin during 2000 we initiated a local area
warehouse concept that utilizes existing space in selected stores to ensure the
availability of certain pdq items on a sameday basis on average a local area
warehouse carries between 7500 and 12000 skus in addition our proprietary
electronic parts catalog enables our sales associates to identify an extensive
number of applications for the skus that we carry as well as parts that are
required for or complementary to these applications we believe that our
ability to deliver an aggregate of approximately 120000 skus as well as the
capabilities provided by our electronic parts catalog are highly valued by our
customers and differentiate us from our competitors particularly mass
merchandisers

   superior customer service  we believe that our customers place significant
value on our welltrained sales associates who offer knowledgeable assistance
in product selection and installation and that this differentiates us from
mass merchandisers we invest substantial resources in the recruiting and
training of our employees and provide formal classroom workshops seminars and
automotive service excellencetm certification to build technical managerial
and customer service skills in addition we enhanced our human resources
management capabilities in 2000 by hiring an experienced senior vice president
of human resources and by introducing new training programs and human resource
systems in order to increase employee retention as a result of these
initiatives our number of retained employees at december 29 2001 increased
31 when compared with the number retained during 2000 we believe that higher
employee retention levels lead to increased customer satisfaction and higher
sales and differentiate us from mass merchandisers

   experienced management team with proven track record  the 18 members of our
senior management team have an average of 15 years experience with us and 17
years in the industry and successfully have grown our company to the second
largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the united states our
management team has accomplished this using a disciplined strategy of growing
comparable store sales opening new stores and making selective acquisitions
through the 545store acquisition of western auto in november 1998 and the
30store acquisition of carport in april 2001 this team has demonstrated its
ability to integrate efficiently and successfully both large and small
acquisitions we intend to leverage this experience as we integrate discount
in addition the discount acquisition provided us with access to a pool of
talented managers in particular peter fontaine the former chairman and ceo
of discount became a member of our board of directors upon the closing of the
discount acquisition

growth strategy

   our growth strategy consists of the following

   increase our comparable store sales  we have been an industry leader in
comparable store sales over the last five years averaging 69 annually we
plan to increase our comparable store sales in both the diy and difm categories
by among other things 1 implementing merchandising and marketing
initiatives 2 investing in storelevel systems to enhance our ability to
recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per customer
3 refining our store selection and instock availability through customized
assortments and other supply chain initiatives 4 continuing to increase
customer service through store staffing and retention initiatives and 5
increasing our commercial delivery sales by focusing on key customers to grow
average sales per truck in particular we intend to continue to make the
necessary investments in several applications that are critical to improving
our customer service and instock availability we have established strong
inventory management systems at the store and distribution center level and in
2001 began to implement a fullyintegrated pointofsale system and electronic
parts catalog

   continue to enhance our margins  we have improved our ebitda margin by 241
basis points from 55 in 1999 to 79 in 2001 in addition to driving
operating margin expansion via improved comparable store sales we will
continue to focus on increasing margins by 1 improving our purchasing
efficiencies with vendors 2 optimizing our supply chain infrastructure and
existing distribution network and 3 leveraging our overall scale to reduce
other operating expenses as a percentage of sales following a comprehensive
review of our supply chain infrastructure we have identified specific cost
savings and opportunities to improve inventory turns as a result we believe
we can increase supply chain efficiencies through selective facility
rationalization such as our recent decision to close our jeffersonville ohio
facility more efficient truck scheduling and routing and better utilization of
custom inventory mixes

   increase return on capital  we believe we can increase our return on
capital successfully by 1 leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase
inventory turns 2 further extending payment terms with our vendors and 3
generating strong comparable store sales as well as increasing our margins in
addition we believe we can drive return on capital by expanding our store base
in existing markets selectively based on our experience such inmarket
openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to
leverage our distribution infrastructure marketing expenditures and local
management resources we intend to add stores in existing markets including
100 to 125 stores in 2002 through new store openings and selective acquisitions

   successfully integrate discount  our management team has developed a
detailed strategy to integrate discount including 1 remerchandising stores
to increase parts availability and instock position 2 increasing purchasing
efficiencies 3 leveraging distribution and administrative costs and 4
enhancing existing commercial delivery programs and selectively adding programs
to discount stores we plan to convert all of discounts stores to the advance
auto parts store format and name we have prepared a systematic integration
plan that includes separate timetables for stores located inside and outside of
florida we plan to convert all discount stores that are located outside of
florida to advance auto parts stores by the end of 2002 during this period
discount stores that are located in florida will be refurbished and converted
to our systems

                                      6

page

and merchandising plans with complete conversions to advance auto parts
stores including name change and store format remodeling phased in over the
next three to four years we believe that discounts geographic store
concentration and our use of dedicated integration teams will result in minimal
disruption of the combined business

purchasing and merchandising

   virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by
personnel at our corporate offices in roanoke virginia in addition specialty
merchandise is purchased in our kansas city missouri office in 2001 we
purchased merchandise from over 200 vendors with no single vendor accounting
for more than 8 of purchases our purchasing strategy involves negotiating
multiyear agreements with certain vendors in connection with our acquisition
of western we entered into several longterm agreements that provided more
favorable terms and pricing due to our increased purchasing volumes due
largely to the purchasing efficiencies that we were able to obtain primarily
from existing vendors as a result of the western merger we increased our gross
margin on a companywide basis from 364 for 1999 to 392 for 2000 we also
expect to achieve incremental cost savings from the discount acquisition to
date we have renegotiated successfully the majority of our existing contracts
with our major vendors resulting in lower product costs as a result of
increasing economies of scale

   our purchasing team is currently led by a group of six senior professionals
who have an average of over 15 years of automotive purchasing experience and
over 20 years in retail this team is skilled in sourcing products globally and
maintaining high quality levels while streamlining costs associated with the
handling of merchandise through the supply chain the purchasing team has
developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and is involved currently
in implementing a bestinclass category management process to improve
comparable store sales gross margin and inventory turns

   our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality
brand name automotive parts and accessories such as monroe bendix purolator
and ac delco which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to
commercial delivery customers in addition to these branded products we stock
a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value
conscious customers sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our
net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or
general accessories we are currently in the process of customizing our product
mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each
individual store based on that stores historical and projected sales mix and
regionally specific needs

marketing and advertising

   we have an extensive marketing and advertising program designed to
communicate our merchandise offerings product assortment competitive prices
and commitment to customer service the program is focused on establishing us
as the solution for a customers automotive needs we utilize a combination of
tools to reinforce our brand image including print promotional signage
television radio and outdoor media plus our proprietary instore television
network and internet site

   our advertising plan is based on a monthly program built around a
promotional theme and a feature product campaign the plan is supported by
print and instore signage our television advertising is targeted on a
regional basis to sports programming radio advertising which is used as a
supplementary medium generally airs during peak drive times we also sponsor
sporting events racing teams and other events at all levels in a grassroots
effort to impact individual communities

   we intend to implement a marketing and advertising program for the discount
stores that is consistent with our marketing and advertising program for our
advance auto parts stores which we believe will increase sales in the discount
stores

distribution and warehousing

   we operate currently five distribution centers that service advance auto
parts stores we also operate a separate distribution center that supports the
western auto retail stores and the wholesale dealer operations and

                                      9

in 2002 will service our advance stores all distribution centers are equipped
with technologically advanced material handling equipment including carousels
picktolight systems radio frequency technology and automated sorting
systems

   we offer over 25000 skus to substantially all of our domestic retail stores
via our nine pdqr warehouses stores place orders to these facilities through
an online ordering system and ordered parts are delivered to substantially all
stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdqr trucking
fleet in addition we operate a pdqr warehouse that stocks approximately
80000 skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories this facility
is known as the master pdqr warehouse and utilizes existing pdqr
distribution infrastructure to provide next day service to substantially all of
our stores during 2000 we implemented a new local area warehouse distribution
concept that utilizes store space to provide certain markets with an additional
customized mix of approximately 7500 to 12000 skus at december 29 2001 we
operated six local area warehouse facilities

   we also operate two distribution centers that were acquired through the
discount acquisition in addition we operate 10 parts express warehouses that
deliver parts to our stores on a same day or next day basis as a result of the
integration of discount we expect to rationalize further our distribution
facilities to utilize the distribution capacity we acquired from discount more
efficiently

management information systems

   we have developed a flexible technology infrastructure that supports our
growth strategy our information technology infrastructure is comprised of
software and hardware designed to integrate store distribution and vendor
services into a seamless network all stores corporate and regional offices
and distribution centers are linked via a communications network which is
based on frame relay technology our stores in puerto rico are linked to the
communications network via satellite electronic documents transferred between
us and our vendors expedite the ordering receiving and merchandise payment
processes we expect to integrate our technology platform into discounts
stores distribution centers and administrative offices by early 2003

store based information systems

   our store based information systems which are designed to improve the
efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service are comprised of
pointofsale or pos electronic parts catalog or epc storelevel inventory
management and store intranet or storenet systems these systems are
integrated tightly and together provide real time comprehensive information to
store and merchandising personnel resulting in improved customer service
levels and instock availability we intend to have the discount auto parts
stores integrated into our store based information systems by the end of 2002

   pointofsale  our pos system was originally installed in 1981 enhanced
over the years and reengineered in 1995 pos information is used to formulate
pricing marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory
rapidly this system has improved store productivity and customer service by
streamlining store procedures we are currently rolling out a new pos system in
all of our stores the new pos system is designed to improve customer checkout
time and decrease the time required to train new store associates in addition
the new pos system will provide additional customer purchase and warranty
history which may be used for customer demographic analysis

   electronic parts catalog  our epc system is a software system that enables
our sales associates to identify over 20 million application uses for
automotive parts and accessories the epc system enables sales associates to
assist customers in parts selection and ordering based on the year model
engine type and application needed if a part is not available at one of our
standalone stores the epc system can also determine whether the part is
carried and instock through our pdqr system the epc system also enables our
sales associates to identify additional parts that are required for or
complementary to a customers specific application

                                      10

this generally leads to increased average sales per transaction the
integration of this system with our pos system improves customer service by
reducing time spent at the cash register and fully automating the sales process
between the parts counter and our pos register this system enables sales
associates to order parts and accessories electronically from our pdqr
system with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated
delivery time additionally information about a customers automobile can be
entered into a permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately
whenever the customer visits or telephones the store

   in conjunction with the rollout of our new pos system we are also
installing a new epc in our stores this new catalog which is fully integrated
with the new pos system will provide store associates with additional product
information including graphics and system diagrams the new catalog will use
search engines and more user friendly navigation tools that will enhance our
sales associates ability to lookup parts

   to ensure ongoing improvement of epc information in all stores we have
developed a centrally based epc data management system that allows us to reduce
the cycle time for cataloging and delivering updated product data to stores
this system also provides the capability of cataloging nonapplication specific
parts and additional product information such as technical bulletins images
of parts and related diagrams of automobiles and expanded lists of related
parts for the item being purchased

   storelevel inventory management system  our storelevel inventory
management system provides realtime inventory tracking at the storelevel
with the storelevel system store personnel can check the quantity of onhand
inventory for any sku automatically process returns and defective merchandise
designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers we are testing
the effectiveness and viability of radio frequency hand held devices in
approximately 200 of our retail stores that should increase inventory
utilization and ensure the accuracy of inventory movements

   store intranet  installed in june of 1998 our storenet system delivers
product information electronic manuals forms and internal communications to
all store employees financial reports are delivered to the store managers via
storenet each accounting period our online learning center delivers online
training programs to all employees a tracking and reporting function provides
human resources and management with an overview of training schedules and
results by employee

   customer contact center  in the first quarter of 2001 we installed new
call routing software and customer service software established a customer
contact center and consolidated all support centers implementation of the
customer contact center has resulted in a substantial improvement in the speed
of call answers a reduction in calls to voice mail and a reduction in the
number of outbound calls required to respond to voice mail

logistics and purchasing information systems

   distribution center management system  our distribution management system
or dcms provides realtime inventory tracking through the processes of
receiving picking shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers the
dcms integrated with material handling equipment significantly reduces
warehouse and distribution costs while improving efficiency all of our
logistic facilities currently use this technology as a result we have the
capacity to service over 2500 stores and our wholesale operations from our six
distribution centers in addition we acquired two distribution centers through
the discount acquisition increasing our capacity to service stores we are
currently in the process of enhancing the dcms and inventory systems to support
service of multiple segments from the same distribution center in addition we
intend to have the operations of discount integrated into our distribution
management systems by the end of 2002

   replenishment systems  our e3 replenishment system or e3 which was
implemented in 1994 monitors the distribution center and pdq warehouse
inventory levels and orders additional products when appropriate in addition
the system tracks sales trends by sku allowing us to adjust future orders to
support seasonal and

demographic shifts in demand we are currently in the process of enhancing this
system to improve support of transfer of merchandise among distribution
centers we recently completed the implementation of a storelevel
replenishment version of e3 for our advance auto parts stores in addition we
intend to implement our replenishment systems in discounts stores and other
facilities by the end of 2002

in storelevel operations 111 is employed in distribution and 41 is

of employees in addition we have established a number of empowerment programs
for employees such as employee task forces and regular meetings to promote
employee recognition and address customer service issues we believe that these
efforts have provided us with a welltrained loyal workforce that is committed
to high levels of customer service

trade names service marks and trademarks

   we own and have registrations for the trade names advance auto parts
western auto and parts america and the trademark pdqr with the united
states patent and trademark office for use in connection with the automotive
parts retailing business in addition we own and have registered a number of
trademarks with respect to our private label products and we also acquired
from discount various registered trademarks service marks and copyrights we
believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to
our merchandising strategy we do not know of any infringing uses that would
materially affect the use of these marks and actively defend and enforce them

competition

   we compete in the automotive aftermarket parts industry which includes
replacement parts excluding tires accessories maintenance items batteries
and automotive fluids and which according to the us department of commerce
and the automotive aftermarket industry association generated approximately
100 billion in sales in 2000 excluding tires and labor costs we compete in
both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry
although the number of competitors and the level of competition vary by market
both categories are highly fragmented and generally very competitive our
primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive
parts stores including autozone inc oreilly automotive inc and the pep
boysmanny moe  jack wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators
automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers
that carry automotive products including walmart target and kmart we
believe that chains of automotive parts stores like us with multiple
locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer
service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as
compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or
associated with other retailers or jobbers the principal competitive factors
that affect our business include price store location customer service and
product offerings quality and availability

environmental matters

   we are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental
regulations relating to the operation of our business including those
governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants and regarding ownership
and operation of real property we handle hazardous materials as part of our
operations and our customers may also use hazardous materials on our
properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties we
currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive
batteries and used lubricants at some of our stores as a service to our
customers under agreements with third party vendors pursuant to these
agreements used batteries and lubricants are collected by our employees
deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and stored by us until
collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal persons
who arrange for the disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic
substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any
affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances in
january 1999 we were notified by the united states environmental protection
agency that western may have potential liability under the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act relating to two battery
salvage and recycling sites that were in operation in the 1970s and 1980s this
matter has since been settled for an amount not material to our current
financial position or future results of operations

   we own and lease real property under various environmental laws and
regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be
liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances
on under or in such property these laws often impose joint and several
liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic
substances other environmental laws and common law principles also could be
used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the
environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or
operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated
with exposure to released hazardous substances compliance with these laws and
regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date we believe
that we are currently in material compliance with these laws and regulations

services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation of the

attorneys fees and costs the defendants including us and discount filed a
motion to dismiss in late october 2000 on october 18 2001 the court denied
the motion to dismiss on all but one count it is expected that the discovery
phase of the litigation will now commence including with respect to us and
discount however determinations as to the discovery schedule and scope have
not yet been made we believe these claims are without merit and intend to
defend them vigorously however the ultimate outcome of this matter can not be
ascertained at this time

registered under the securities act

   from january 1 2001 through february 6 2002 we issued and sold 47600
shares of our common stock at a price per share of 2100 for aggregate

   the issuances described above were exempt from registration under the
securities act pursuant to section 42 of the securities act rule 701
promulgated thereunder which exempts certain offers and sales of securities
pursuant to certain compensatory benefits plans rule 144a thereunder or
regulation d promulgated thereunder as a transaction by an issuer not involving
a public offering where each purchaser was either an accredited investor or a
nonaccredited investor where the aggregate number of such investors did not

issued in these transactions and there was no general solicitation or
advertising

   as of march 20 2002 the board of directors had approved the grant of
options to purchase an aggregate of 531600 shares of our common stock to our
directors officers and employees all of which were outstanding with a
weighted average exercise price of 4200 at the time these options were
issued under our various stock option plans we believed that each of the
issuances were exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act
either by virtue of i an exemption provided by rule 701 promulgated under the
securities act for securities offered under compensatory benefit plans and
contracts or ii a nosale theory under section ii of the securities act
since none of the optionees provided any consideration for the grants the sale
of the underlying option shares occurs only when the option is exercised and
the purchase price for the shares is paid to us

the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks our discussion contains
forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks
and uncertainties such as our plans objectives expectations and intentions
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of a number of

elsewhere in this report

general

   we conduct all of our operations through our wholly owned subsidiary
advance stores company incorporated and its subsidiaries or advance stores
we were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until
the 1980s in the 1980s we sharpened our marketing focus to target sales of
automotive parts and accessories to doityourself or diy customers and
accelerated our growth strategy from the 1980s through the present we have
grown significantly through new store openings strong comparable store sales
growth and strategic acquisitions additionally in 1996 we began to
aggressively expand our sales to doitforme or difm customers by
implementing a commercial delivery program that supplies parts and accessories
to third party professional installers and repair providers

   at december 29 2001 we had 1775 stores operating under the advance auto
parts trade name in 37 states in the northeastern southeastern and
midwestern regions of the united states and 669 stores operating under the
discount auto parts trade name in the southeastern region of the united
states in addition we had 40 stores operating under the western auto trade
name primarily located in puerto rico and the virgin islands we are the second
largest specialty retailer of automotive parts accessories and maintenance
items to diy customers in the united states based on store count and sales we
currently are the largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the
majority of the states in which we operate based on store count

   our combined operations are conducted in two operating segments retail and
wholesale the retail segment consists of our retail operations operating under
the trade names advance auto parts and discount auto parts in the united
states and western auto in puerto rico the virgin islands and one store in
california our wholesale segment includes a wholesale distribution network
which includes distribution services of automotive parts and accessories to
approximately 470 independently owned dealer stores in 44 states operating
under the western auto trade name our wholesale operations accounted for
approximately 39 of our net sales for the year ended december 29 2001 the
discussion for all periods presented in this section has been restated to
reflect our western auto store located in california in the retail segment

acquisitions and recapitalization

   discount acquisition  on november 28 2001 we acquired discount in a
transaction in which discounts shareholders received 750 per share in cash
or approximately 1285 million in the aggregate plus 02577 shares of our
common stock for each share of discount common stock we issued approximately
43 million shares of our common stock to the former discount shareholders
which represented 132 of our total shares outstanding immediately following
the acquisition the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting accordingly the results of operations for discount for
the periods from december 2 2001 are included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values negative
goodwill of 757 million resulting from total excess fair value over the
purchase price was allocated proportionately as a reduction to noncurrent
assets primarily property and equipment

                                      22

   in connection with the discount acquisition we issued an additional 200
million face value of 1025 senior subordinated notes and entered into a new
senior credit facility that provides for 1 a 180 million tranche a term loan
facility and a 305 million tranche b term loan facility and 2 a 160 million
revolving credit facility including a letter of credit subfacility upon the
closing of the discount acquisition we used 485 million of borrowings under
the new senior credit facility and net proceeds of 1856 million from the sale
of the senior subordinated notes to among other things pay the cash portion
of the acquisition consideration repay all amounts outstanding under our
thenexisting credit facility repay 2047 million of outstanding indebtedness
of discount including prepayment penalties and purchase discounts gallman
distribution facility from the lessor

   at november 28 2001 discount had 671 stores in six states including the
leading market position in florida with 437 stores including the acquired
discount stores we had 2484 stores at december 29 2001 on a pro forma
basis our net sales and ebitda as adjusted for 2001 would have been
31 billion and 2619 million we expect to achieve ongoing purchasing
savings as a result of the acquisition in addition we expect to achieve
significant savings from the optimization of our combined distribution network
including more efficient capacity utilization at discounts mississippi
distribution center as well as from the reduction of overlapping
administrative functions during 2002 we expect these savings to result in
approximately 30 million of incremental ebitda excluding certain onetime
integration expenses we expect these onetime integration expenses to total
approximately 53 million from the close of the acquisition through the end of
2003 approximately 41 million of which we expect to incur in 2002

   carport acquisition  on april 23 2001 we completed our acquisition of the
assets used in the operation of carport auto parts inc retail auto parts
stores located throughout alabama and mississippi based upon store count this
made us the largest retailer of automotive parts in this market upon the
closing of the acquisition we decided to close 21 carport stores not expected
to meet longterm profitability objectives the remaining 30 carport locations
were converted to the advance auto parts store format within six weeks of the
acquisition the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting accordingly the results of operations of carport for the
periods from april 23 2001 are included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements the purchase price of 215 million has been allocated to
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values at
the date of acquisition this allocation resulted in the recognition of 37
million in goodwill

   western auto acquisition  on november 2 1998 we acquired western auto
supply company or western from sears the purchase price included the payment
of 11474606 shares of our common stock and 1850 million in cash certain of
our stockholders invested an additional 700 million in equity to fund a
portion of the cash portion of the purchase price the remainder of which was
funded through additional borrowings under our prior credit facility and cash
on hand the western merger was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting accordingly the results of operations of western for the periods
from november 2 1998 are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values negative goodwill of
47 million resulting from total excess fair value over the purchase price
was allocated proportionately as a reduction to noncurrent assets primarily
property and equipment

   we have achieved significant benefits from the combination with western
through improved purchasing efficiencies from vendors consolidated
advertising distribution and corporate support efficiencies the western
merger resulted in the addition of a net 545 advance auto parts stores 39
western auto stores and the wholesale distribution network

   recapitalization  on april 15 1998 we consummated a recapitalization in
which freeman spogli  co and ripplewood partners lp purchased
approximately 805 million and 200 million of our common stock
respectively representing approximately 64 and 16 of our outstanding common
stock immediately following the recapitalization in connection with the
recapitalization management purchased approximately 80 million

                                      23

or approximately 6 of our outstanding common stock the purchase of common
stock by management resulted in stockholder subscription receivables the notes
are full recourse and provide for annual interest payments at the prime rate
with the entire principal amount due on april 15 2003 in addition on april
15 1998 we entered into our prior credit facility and also issued 200
million of senior subordinated notes and approximately 112 million in face
amount of senior discount debentures in connection with these transactions we
extinguished a substantial portion of our existing notes payable and longterm
debt these transactions collectively represent the recapitalization we have
accounted for the recapitalization for financial reporting purposes as the sale
of common stock the issuance of debt the redemption of common and preferred
stock and the repayment of notes payable and longterm debt in connection with
the discount acquisition we repaid all amounts outstanding under our prior
credit facility and entered into our senior credit facility

nonrecurring charges

   during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded the following nonrecurring
charges net of tax 07 million in integration expenses associated with the
discount acquisition 22 million in lease termination expenses resulting from
the planned closure of approximately 27 advance auto parts stores that overlap
with discount stores 52 million in stock option compensation charges
described below 63 million in supply chain initiatives described below 65
million to reduce the book value of certain excess property currently held for
sale described below 21 million to implement an accounting change associated
with the reclassification of cooperative income from selling general and
administrative expense to gross margin described below and 37 million in
charges related to the writeoff of deferred debt issuance costs associated
with refinancing our credit facility in connection with the discount
acquisition

   the 52 million net of tax in stock option compensation charges resulted
from variable provisions of our employee stock option plans that were in place
when we were a private company and that we since have eliminated under the
modified plan option exercise prices are fixed and therefore will not result
in future compensation expense no additional common shares or options were
issued as a result of these modifications

   the 63 million net of tax in expenses relating to supply change
initiatives is related to our recent review of our supply chain and logistics
operations including our distribution costs and inventory stocking levels as
part of this review we have identified a portion of our inventory and expect
to identify additional inventory that we may offer in the future only in
certain store locations or regions the expenses related to this initiative are
primarily related to restocking and inventory handling charges we may generate
significant cash proceeds as a result of this initiative by reducing our
inventory investment while continuing to maintain high levels of customer
service and instock positions

   the reduction of book value of certain properties of 65 million net of
tax is related to the revaluation of certain excess properties currently held
for sale in addition we have closed and may explore the future possibility of
closing additional distribution facilities and may writedown the value of such
facilities in connection with our supply chain initiative

   the expense of 21 million net of tax to implement an accounting change
results from a change in our method of accounting for certain cooperative
advertising funds received from vendors previously we accounted for these
funds as a reduction to advertising expense as the related advertising expenses
were incurred in order to better align the reporting of these payments with
the sale of the associated product we decided to recognize these payments as a
reduction to the cost of inventory acquired from vendors which results in a
lower cost of sales for the products sold we believe this is a preferable
method of accounting the change will result in a slightly more conservative
recognition of income in future periods this change in accounting principle
has been applied in our 2001 financial statements as if the change occurred at
the beginning of our 2001 fiscal year and has been recognized as a cumulative
effect of the change in accounting principle this change results in lower cost
of sales with corresponding increases in selling general and administrative
expenses

critical accounting policies

   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
policies generally accepted in the united states our discussion and analysis
of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these
financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires
the application of these accounting policies in addition to certain estimates
and judgments by our management our estimates and judgments are based on
currently available information historical results and other assumptions we
believe are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates

   the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of
the financial statements as discussed above

  vendor incentives

   we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising
allowances volume rebates and other miscellaneous agreements many of the
incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year while
others are negotiated on an annual basis our vendors require us to use certain
cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising these
restricted cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to
selling general and administrative expenses as advertising expenditures are
incurred unrestricted cooperative advertising revenue rebates and other
miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases andor the sale of the
product amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned
are reflected as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets included
elsewhere in this prospectus we record unrestricted cooperative advertising
and volume rebates earned as a reduction of inventory and recognize the
incentives as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold shortterm
incentives are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of
the annual agreement term and are not recorded as reductions to inventory

   we recognize other incentives earned related to longterm agreements as a
reduction to cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing
of purchases these incentives are not recorded as reductions to inventory the
amounts earned under longterm arrangements not recorded as a reduction of
inventory are based on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over
the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned the
incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a
percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract our
margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or
results differ from our estimates but over the life of the contract would be
the same

   during the fourth quarter of 2001 we changed our method of accounting for
unrestricted cooperative advertising allowances these incentives are now
treated as a reduction to inventory and the corresponding cost of sales
previously we accounted for these incentives as a reduction to selling
general and administrative expenses to the extent advertising expense was
incurred

  inventory

   minimal inventory shrink reserves are recorded related to advance auto parts
stores as a result of our extensive and frequent cycle counting program our
estimates related to these shrink reserves depend on the effectiveness of the
cycle counting programs we evaluate the effectiveness of these programs on an
ongoing basis

   minimal reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are
recorded as well the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of
obsolescence is minimal in addition historically we have been able to return
excess items to the vendor for credit we provide reserves where less than full
credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items
will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost future changes
by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess
inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory

                                      25

page

  warranties

   we record accruals for future warranty claims related to warranty programs
for batteries tires roadside assistance and craftsman products our accruals
are based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim
experience if claims experience differs from historical levels revisions in
our estimates may be required

  restructuring and closed store liabilities

   we recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a decision is
made to close a store location this provision includes future minimum lease
payments common area maintenance and taxes additionally we make certain
assumptions related to potential subleases and lease buyouts that reduce the
recorded amount of the accrual these assumptions are based on our knowledge of
the market and the relevant experience however the inability to enter into
the subleases or obtain buyouts within the estimated timeframe may result in
increases or decreases to these reserves

  contingencies

   we accrue for obligations including estimated legal costs when it is
probable and the amount is reasonably estimable as facts concerning
contingencies become known we reassess our position both with respect to gain
contingencies and accrued liabilities and other potential exposures estimates
that are particularly sensitive to future change include tax environmental and
legal matters which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional
information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

net sales

   net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales new store net sales
service net sales net sales to the wholesale dealer network and finance
charges on installment sales comparable store sales is calculated based on the
change in net sales starting once a store has been open for 13 complete
accounting periods each period represents four weeks relocations are
included in comparable store sales from the original date of opening each
parts america store that was acquired in the western merger and subsequently
converted to an advance auto parts store has been included in the comparable
store sales calculation after 13 complete accounting periods following the
completion of its physical conversion to an advance auto parts store
additionally the stores acquired in the carport and discount acquisitions will
be included in the comparable store sales calculation

                                      28

page

following thirteen complete accounting periods following their system
conversion to the advance auto parts store system we do not include net sales
from the western auto retail stores in our comparable store sales calculation

cost of sales

   our cost of sales includes merchandise costs and warehouse and distribution
expenses as well as service labor costs of our western auto stores gross
profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our
product mix price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations
in merchandise costs and vendor programs we seek to avoid fluctuation in
merchandise costs by entering into longterm purchasing agreements with vendors
in exchange for pricing certainty

  fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000

   net sales for 2001 were 25176 million an increase of 2296 million or
100 over net sales for 2000 net sales for the retail segment increased
2524 million or 116 the net sales increase for the retail segment was due
to an increase in comparable store sales of 62 sales from the recently
acquired discount stores and contributions from new stores opened within the
last year the comparable store sales increase of 62 was a result of growth
in both the diy and difm market segments as well as the continued maturation
of new stores net sales for the wholesale segment decreased 228 million due
to a decline in the number of dealer stores we serviced and lower average sales
to each dealer

   during 2001 we opened 110 new stores including the 30 net stores from the
carport acquisition in april 2001 relocated 18 stores and closed 24 stores
additionally we acquired 671 stores in the discount acquisition in november
2001 and closed two of these stores in december 2001 bringing the total number
of stores to 2484 we have increased the number of our stores participating in
our commercial delivery program to 1370 primarily as a result of adding 167
discount stores with existing commercial delivery programs additionally as of
december 29 2001 we supplied approximately 470 independent dealers through
the wholesale dealer network

   gross profit for 2001 excluding nonrecurring charges associated with our
supply chain initiatives was 10760 million or 427 of net sales as
compared to 8959 million or 392 of net sales in 2000 the change in
accounting principle accounted for approximately 220 basis points of the
increase with the remaining increase attributable to positive shifts in product
mix the 83 million net gain recorded as a reduction to cost of sales during
the first quarter of 2001 as a result of a vendor contract settlement was
equally offset by higher cost of sales during the last three quarters of 2001
as a result of the new supplier contract the gross profit for the retail
segment excluding nonrecurring charges associated with our supply chain
initiatives was 10620 million or 439 of net sales for 2001 as compared
to 8810 million or 407 of net sales in 2000 the increase in gross profit
was primarily attributable to the change in accounting principle and positive
shifts in product mix

   selling general and administrative expenses before merger and integration
expenses nonrecurring charges and noncash stock option compensation expense
increased to 9475 million or 376 of net sales for 2001 from 8015
million or 350 of net sales for 2000 the change in accounting principle
accounted for approximately 220 basis points of the increase with the remaining
increase attributable to increased investment in store staffing and retention
initiatives which were put in place in the third quarter of 2000 and higher
insurance costs due to adverse changes in the insurance market

   ebitda operating income plus depreciation and amortization as adjusted
for merger and integration expenses expenses associated with our supply chain
initiatives restructuring expenses devaluation of assets held for sale and
noncash and other employee compensation was 1997 million in 2001 or 79 of
net sales as compared to 1619 million or 71 of net sales in 2000 ebitda
is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and
should not be considered as a substitute for net income as an indicator of
operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as measured by gaap
as a measure of liquidity our method for calculating ebitda may differ from
similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe certain
nonrecurring charges noncash and other employee compensation and merger and
integration expenses should be eliminated from the ebitda calculation to
evaluate our operating performance

   interest expense for 2001 was 619 million or 25 of net sales as
compared to 666 million or 29 of net sales in 2000 the decrease in
interest expense was a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and a
decrease in average interest rates over 2000

   our effective income tax rate was 397 of pretax income for 2001 as
compared to 388 for 2000 this increase is a result of an increase in the
amount of permanent differences between book and tax reporting treatment on
total income tax expense

   we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt during the
fourth quarter of 2001 this loss is the result of the writeoff of 37
million net of 24 million income taxes or 013 loss per diluted share of
deferred debt issuance costs associated with refinancing our credit facility in
connection with the discount acquisition

   we also recorded a loss of 21 million net of 14 million of income
taxes or 007 loss per diluted share for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of 2001 this change in
accounting principle is a result of our change in accounting method related to
certain cooperative advertising funds received from vendors this change
resulted in the reduction of the cost of inventory acquired from vendors and
the resulting costs of sales

   after onetime expenses we recorded net income of 114 million or 039
per diluted share for 2001 as compared to net income of 196 million or
068 per diluted share for 2000 we recorded certain onetime expenses in
2001 resulting in a net loss of 091 per diluted share as a percentage of
sales net income for fiscal 2001 was 05 as compared to 08 for 2000

  fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

   net sales for 2000 were 22880 million an increase of 811 million or
37 over net sales for 1999 net sales for the retail segment increased
1499 million or 74 the net sales increase for the retail segment was due
to an increase in the comparable store sales of 44 and contributions from new
stores opened within the last year the comparable store sales increase of 44
was primarily a result of growth in both the diy and difm market segments as
well as the continued maturation of new stores and the converted parts america
stores net sales for the wholesale segment decreased 363 or 688 million
due to a decline in the number of dealer stores serviced and lower average
sales to each dealer

   during 2000 we opened 140 new stores relocated 10 stores and closed 28
stores bringing the total retail segment stores to 1729 at year end we had
1210 stores participating in our commercial delivery program a result of
adding 116 net stores to the program during 2000 additionally at december 30
2000 we supplied approximately 590 independent dealers through the wholesale
dealer network and our one store in california

   gross profit for 2000 was 8959 million or 392 of net sales as compared
to 8028 million or 364 of net sales in 1999 the gross profit percentage
increased 180 basis points due to the realization of certain purchasing
synergies fewer product liquidations and a decline in net sales of the lower
margin wholesale

segment additionally lower inventory shrinkage accounted for approximately 60
basis points and lower logistics costs accounted for approximately 30 basis
points of the increased gross profit margin the higher shrinkage and logistics
costs in 1999 were related to merchandise conversions and product liquidations
resulting from the western merger the gross profit for the retail segment was
8810 million or 407 of net sales for 2000 as compared to 7920 million
or 393 of net sales for 1999 during the fourth quarter of 2000 we recorded
a gain as a reduction to cost of sales of 33 million related to a lawsuit
against a supplier the gain represents actual damages incurred under an
interim supply agreement with the supplier which provided for higher
merchandise costs subsequent to december 30 2000 we agreed to a cash
settlement of 166 million from the supplier the remainder of the cash
settlement over the originally recorded gain reduced by higher product costs
incurred under the interim supply agreement and fees and expenses related to
the settlement of the matter was recognized as an 83 million reduction to
cost of sales during the first quarter of 2001

   selling general and administrative expenses before impairment of assets
held for sale integration expenses and noncash stock option compensation
increased to 8015 million or 350 of net sales for 2000 from 7405
million or 335 of net sales for fiscal 1999 the increase in selling
general and administrative expenses primarily is attributable to the continued
sales decline in the wholesale segment which carries lower selling general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as compared to the retail
segment additionally we incurred higher than expected medical claims as well
as higher payroll insurance and depreciation expense partially offset by a
decrease in net advertising costs as a percentage of sales as compared to
1999 we made certain investments in personnel and labor which we believe are
critical to our longterm success the increase in depreciation expense is
primarily related to the change in an accounting estimate to reduce the
depreciable lives of certain property and equipment on a prospective basis

   ebitda operating income plus depreciation and amortization as adjusted
for noncash and other employee compensation and integration expenses was
1619 million in 2000 or 71 of net sales as compared to 1219 million or
55 of net sales in fiscal 1999 ebitda is not intended to represent cash
flow from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered as a
substitute for net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an
alternative to cash flow as measured by gaap as a measure of liquidity our
method for calculating ebitda may differ from similarly titled measures
reported by other companies we believe certain nonrecurring charges noncash
and other employee compensation and merger and integration expenses should be
eliminated from the ebitda calculation to evaluate our operating performance

   interest expense for 2000 was 666 million or 29 of net sales as
compared to 628 million or 28 of net sales for 1999 the increase in
interest expense was a result of an increase in interest rates over 1999
offset by a decrease in net outstanding borrowings during 2000 we repurchased
306 million of senior subordinated notes on the open market for 250 million

   our effective income tax rate was 388 of pretax income for 2000 as
compared to 332 of pretax loss for 1999 this increase is due to our pretax
income in 2000 and pretax loss in 1999 and the resulting effect of permanent
differences between book and tax reporting treatment on total income tax
expense benefit due to uncertainties related to the realization of deferred
tax assets for certain net operating loss carryforwards we recognized
additional valuation allowances of 09 million during 2000

   we recorded net income of 196 million or 068 per diluted share for
2000 as compared to a net loss of 253 million or 090 per diluted share
for 1999 in addition to the items previously discussed we also recorded an
extraordinary gain related to the early extinguishment of debt of 29 million
or 010 per diluted share net of 18 million provided for income taxes and
09 million for the writeoff of associated deferred debt issuance costs as a
percentage of sales net income for 2000 was 08 as compared to a net loss of
11 for 1999

million of senior discount debentures 3554 million of senior subordinated
notes borrowings of 4950 million under our senior credit facility and 100
million of indebtedness under the mcduffie county development authority taxable
industrial bonds

   in connection with the discount acquisition we entered into the senior
credit facility and issued 2000 million in face amount of our senior
subordinated notes upon consummation of the discount acquisition we used
485 million of borrowings under the new senior credit facility and net
proceeds of 1856 million from the sale of the senior subordinated notes to
1 fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to the discount
shareholders and inthemoney option holders 2 repay 2047 million in
borrowings under discounts credit facility including repayment premiums of
58 million 3 purchase discounts gallman distribution facility from the
lessor for 341 million 4 repay 2703 million of borrowings under our
prior credit facility and 5 pay approximately 30 million in related
transaction fees and expenses at february 28 2002 we had approximately 174
million in letters of credit outstanding and had no borrowings under the
revolving credit facility resulting in available borrowings of 1426 million
under the revolving credit facility

   in 2001 net cash provided by operating activities was 1035 million this
amount consisted of 114 million in net income depreciation and amortization
of 712 million amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond
discount of 146 million impairment of assets held for sale of 123 million
amortization of stock option compensation of 117 million and an increase of

capital expenditures of 637 million and cash consideration of 3900 million
in the discount and carport mergers net cash provided by financing activities
was 3476 million and was comprised primarily of net borrowings and issuance
of equity

   in 2000 net cash provided by operating activities was 1040 million this
amount consisted of 196 million in net income depreciation and amortization
of 668 million amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond
discount of 131 million and a decrease of 45 million in net working capital
and other operating activities net cash used for investing activities was
650 million and was comprised primarily of capital expenditures net cash
used in financing activities was 436 million and was comprised primarily of
net repayments of longterm debts

   in 1999 net cash used in operating activities was 210 million this
amount consisted of a 253 million net loss offset by depreciation and
amortization of 581 million amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and
bond discount of 122 million and an increase of 660 million in net working
capital and other operating activities net cash used for investing activities
was 1138 million and was comprised primarily of capital expenditures of
1050 million and cash consideration of 130 million in the western merger
net cash provided by financing activities was 1213 million and was comprised
primarily of net borrowings

   our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued
store expansion program store relocations and remodels inventory
requirements the construction and upgrading of distribution centers the
development and implementation of proprietary information systems the discount
acquisition the western merger and the carport acquisition we have financed
our growth through a combination of internally generated funds borrowings
under the credit facility and issuances of equity

   our new stores if leased require capital expenditures of approximately
120000 per store and an inventory investment of approximately 150000 per
store net of vendor payables a portion of the inventory investment is held at
a distribution facility preopening expenses consisting primarily of store
setup costs and training of new store employees average approximately 25000
per store and are expensed when incurred

                                      32

   our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we
open and the timing of those openings within a given year we opened 140 new
stores during 2000 and 80 new stores during 2001 excluding stores acquired in
the carport and discount acquisitions in addition we anticipate adding
approximately 100 to 125 new stores through new store openings and selective
acquisitions during 2002 our capital expenditures were approximately 637
million in 2001 excluding the carport and discount acquisitions these
amounts related to the new store openings the upgrade of our information
systems including our new pointofsale and electronic parts catalog system
and remodels and relocations of existing stores in 2002 we anticipate that
our capital expenditures will be approximately 105 million of which
approximately 34 million will involve conversion and other integration related
capital expenditures associated with the discount acquisition

   historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that
help finance inventory growth and we believe that we will be able to continue
financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms we
anticipate that inventory levels will continue to increase primarily as a
result of new store openings

   as part of normal operations we continually monitor store performance
which results in our closing certain store locations that do not meet
profitability objectives in 2001 we closed three stores as part of 2000
restructuring activities and decided to close or relocate 39 additional stores
that did not meet profitability objectives 27 of which were closed or
relocated at december 29 2001 in addition as part of our ongoing review of
our store performance and our focus on increasing the productivity of our
entire store base we anticipate closing approximately 25 additional advance
auto parts stores in 2002 as a result of the carport acquisition we closed 21
acquired stores not expected to meet profitability objectives as part of our
integration of discount we expect to close 108 and 27 discount and advance
stores respectively that are in overlapping markets as well as discount
stores that do not meet profitability objectives in addition we made the
decision to close a duplicative distribution facility located in
jeffersonville ohio

   the western merger carport acquisition and discount acquisition also
resulted in restructuring reserves recorded in purchase accounting for the
closure of certain stores severance and relocation costs and other facility
exit costs in addition we assumed certain restructuring and deferred
compensation liabilities previously recorded by western and discount at
december 29 2001 these reserves had a remaining balance of 236 million at
december 29 2001 the total liability for the assumed restructuring and
deferred compensation plans was 21 million and 43 million respectively of
which 12 million and 23 million respectively is recorded as a current
liability the classification for deferred compensation is determined by
payment terms elected by plan participants primarily former western employees
which can be changed upon 12 months notice

   we expect that funds provided from operations and available borrowings of
approximately 1426 million under our revolving credit facility at february
28 2002 will provide sufficient funds to operate our business make expected
capital expenditures of approximately 105 million in 2002 finance our
restructuring activities redeem our industrial revenue bonds in november 2002
in an aggregate principal amount of 10 million and fund future debt service on
our senior subordinated notes our senior discount debentures and our senior
credit facility over the next 12 months

seasonality

   our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales
occurring in the spring and summer months in addition our business can be
affected by weather conditions while unusually heavy precipitation tends to
soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely
hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail

recent accounting pronouncements

no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities this
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities
it requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in their statements of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value in september 1999 the fasb issued sfas no 137
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesdeferral of the
effective date of fasb statement no 133 which delayed the effective date of
sfas no 133 to fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 the fasb issued
sfas no 138 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging
activitiesan amendment of sfas no 133 which amended the accounting and
reporting standards for certain risks related to normal purchases and sales
interest and foreign currency transactions addressed by sfas no 133 we
adopted sfas no 133 on december 31 2000 with no material impact on our
financial position or results of operations

   in september 2000 the fasb issued sfas no 140 accounting for transfers
and servicing financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities this
statement replaces sfas no 125 but carries over most of the provisions of
sfas no 125 without reconsideration we implemented sfas no 140 during the
first quarter of 2001 the implementation had no impact on our financial
position or results of operations

   in june 2001 the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards

the first quarter of 2002 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 144 to
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

risk factors

risks relating to our business

we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not
successful

   we have increased our store count significantly from 814 stores at the end
of 1997 to 2484 stores at december 29 2001 we intend to continue to expand
our base of stores as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new
stores there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful the
actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a
number of factors including among other things our ability to manage the
expansion and hire train and retain qualified sales associates the
availability of potential store locations in highly visible welltrafficked
areas and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations there
can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a
timely or profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already
serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales the
newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to
properly merchandise market and price the products required in their
respective markets

   furthermore we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from
make investments in or enter into strategic alliances with companies that
have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into
which we intend to expand our presence any future acquisitions investments
strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks including

      the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates

      the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the
       respective entities

      the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our
       managements attention

      the inability to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and

we may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully including
increasing comparable store sales enhancing our margins and increasing our
return on capital which could adversely affect our business financial
condition and results of operations

   we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales
enhance our margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our
earnings and cash flow if these initiatives are unsuccessful or if we are
unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively our business
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

   successful implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors
specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors
that may be beyond our control these include adverse changes in

      general economic conditions and conditions in local markets which could
       reduce our sales

      the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and
       accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase
       spending

      the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry such as
       consolidation which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor
       relationships

      our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for
       automotive products accessories and services in a timely manner and

      our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel which
       depends in part on the types of recruiting training and benefit
       programs we adopt

we may not be able to integrate discount successfully which could adversely
affect our business financial condition and results of operations

   we acquired discount to capitalize on its leading market position in
florida to increase our store base in our southeastern markets and to create
the opportunity for potential cost savings through operational synergies
achieving the expected benefits of the discount acquisition will depend in
large part on integrating discounts operations and personnel in a timely and
efficient manner some of the difficulties we will have to overcome include

      successfully converting discounts information and accounting systems to
       ours

      integrating our distribution operations with discounts distribution
       operations

      implementing and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and
       policies on a companywide basis

      properly identifying and closing unnecessary stores operations and
       facilities and

      maintaining good and profitable relationships with suppliers

   if we cannot overcome the challenges we face integrating discount our
ability to manage discounts business effectively and profitably could suffer
in addition key employees may leave supplier relationships may be disrupted
and customer service standards could deteriorate moreover the integration
process itself may be disruptive to our business and discounts business as it
will divert the attention of management from its normal operational
responsibilities and duties

   consequently we cannot assure you that discount can be successfully
integrated with our business or that any of the anticipated efficiencies or
cost savings will be realized or realized within the expected time frame or
that revenues will not be lower than expected any of which could harm our
business financial condition and results of operations

if demand for products sold by our stores slows our business financial
condition and results of operations will suffer

   demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow
for a number of reasons including

      the weather as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of
       inclement weather and

      the economy as during periods of good economic conditions more of our
       diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead
       of working on their own cars in periods of declining economic
       conditions both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or
       repair

   if any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline
our business financial condition and results of operations will suffer

we depend on the services of our existing management team and may not be able
to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel

   our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and
experience of our executive officers and senior management team if for any
reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management our
business could suffer we have entered into employment agreements with some of
our executive officers and senior management however these agreements do not
ensure their continued employment with us additionally we cannot assure you
that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior
executives as needed in the future which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations

if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the retail
automotive parts industry we could lose customers and our revenues may decline

   the retail sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is
highly competitive in many areas including price name recognition customer
service and location we compete primarily with national and regional retail
automotive parts chains wholesalers or jobber stores independent operators
automobile dealers that supply parts discount stores and mass merchandisers
that carry automotive replacement parts accessories and maintenance items
some of our competitors possess advantages over us including substantially
greater financial and marketing resources a larger number of stores longer
operating histories greater name recognition larger and more established
customer bases and more established vendor relationships our response to these
competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our
spending which would lower revenue and profitability competitive
disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require
us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current
operating strategies if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise
fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive
disadvantages we could lose customers and our revenues may decline

disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations
could increase our cost of goods sold

   our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with
our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell products to us
at favorable prices and other terms many factors outside of our control may
harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to
sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational
difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the
products we purchase from them in addition the trend towards consolidation
among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with
some vendors and could lead to less competition and consequently higher
prices

risks relating to our financial condition

our level of debt and restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our
ability to take certain actions including obtaining additional financing in
the future that we would otherwise consider in our best interest

   we currently have a significant amount of debt at december 29 2001 we had
total debt of approximately 9557 million our high level of debt could have
important consequences to you for example it could

      impair our ability to implement our growth strategy

      impair our ability to obtain additional financing if needed for
       working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes in
       the future

      place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt

      restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions

      increase our vulnerability to adverse economic industry and business
       conditions or

      cause our interest expense to increase if interest rates in general were
       to increase because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a
       floating rate

our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and
our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need

   we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability
to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations
or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our
obligations our financial and operational performance also depends upon a
number of other factors many of which are beyond our control these factors
include

      economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket
       industry and

      operating difficulties operating costs or pricing pressures we may
       experience

   if we are unable to service our debt we will be required to pursue one or
more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or
restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital however we cannot
assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate
also some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a
majority in interest of the lenders under the senior credit facility the
holders of our senior subordinated notes and the holders of our discount notes
and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative
strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable our lenders would be entitled to
exercise various remedies including foreclosing on our assets under those
circumstances our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments

the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us

   the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures for our senior
subordinated notes and discount notes impose significant operating and
financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet
certain financial tests these restrictions may also have a negative impact on
our business financial condition and results of operations by significantly
limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions including

      incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness

      paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted
       payments

                                      39

page

      making capital expenditures and other investments

      creating liens on our assets

      issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries

      transferring or selling assets currently held by us

      repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness

      engaging in transactions with affiliates

      entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our
       subsidiaries and

      engaging in mergers or consolidations

   the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default
under our indentures and other debt agreements furthermore our senior credit
facility contains certain financial covenants including establishing a maximum
leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio
and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio which if not maintained by
us will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility any of
these defaults if not waived could result in the acceleration of all of our
debt in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable if this
occurs we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to
refinance it even if new financing were available it may not be on terms that
are acceptable to us



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks

   we currently utilize no material derivative financial instruments that
expose us to significant market risk we are exposed to cash flow and fair
value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our longterm debt
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our
debt exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable
rate debt our future exposure to interest rate risk decreased during 2001 due
to decreased interest rates and reduced variable rate debt

   our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our senior
discount debentures and senior subordinated notes our variable rate debt
relates to borrowings under the senior credit facility and the industrial
revenue bonds our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements in
the libor prime federal funds and base cd rates

and the schedules referred to below are the responsibility of the companys
management our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedules based on our audits

   we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test
basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion

   in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly
in all material respects the financial position of advance auto parts inc
and subsidiaries as of december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended december 29 2001 in conformity with accounting principles

vendor incentives and change in accounting method

   the company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative
advertising allowances volume rebates and other miscellaneous agreements many
of the incentives are under longterm agreements terms in excess of one year
while others are negotiated on an annual basis cooperative advertising revenue
restricted by our vendors for advertising use only requires us to submit proof
of advertising these restricted cooperative advertising allowances are
recognized as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses as
advertising expenditures are incurred unrestricted cooperative advertising
revenue ie does not require proof of advertising rebates and other
miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases andor the turn of
inventory the company records unrestricted cooperative advertising and volume
rebates earned as a reduction of inventory and recognizes the incentives as a
reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold the company recognizes the
incentives earned related to other incentives as a reduction to cost of sales
over the life of the agreement based on the timing of purchases these
incentives are not recorded as reductions to inventory the amounts earned
under longterm arrangements not recorded as reduction of inventory are based
on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over the life of the
contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned the incentives are
generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total
estimated purchases over the life of the contract the companys margins could
be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results differ from
our estimates but over the life of the contract would be the same shortterm
incentives are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of
the annual agreement term and are not recorded as reductions to inventory

   amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are
reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
managements estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized
within one year of the balance sheet date has been included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets total deferred
revenue is 17046 and 26994 at december 29 2001 and december 30 2000
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables
net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

   effective december 31 2000 the company changed its method of accounting
for unrestricted cooperative advertising funds received from certain vendors to
recognize these payments as a reduction to the cost of inventory acquired from
these vendors previously these funds were accounted for in the same manner as
restricted cooperative advertising allowances the new method was adopted to
better align the reporting of these payments with the companys and the
vendors use of these payments as reductions to the price of inventory acquired
from the vendors the effect of the change in fiscal 2001 was to increase
income from continuing operations by 358 the cumulative effect of retroactive
application of the change on the year ended december 29 2001 was to reduce
income before extraordinary item by approximately 2065 net of 1360 income
tax or 007 per share the pro forma amounts shown on the statement of
operations have been adjusted for the effect of retroactive application of the
new method on net income and related income taxes for all periods presented

revenue recognition and trade receivables

   the company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to a retail
customer and point of shipment to a wholesale customer while service revenue
is recognized upon performance of service the majority of sales are made for
cash however the company extends credit to certain commercial customers
through a thirdparty provider of private label credit cards receivables under
the private label credit card program are transferred to the thirdparty
provider on a limited recourse basis the company provides an allowance for
doubtful accounts on receivables sold with recourse based upon factors related
to credit risk of specific customers historical trends and other information

   the company incurred financial reporting and tax losses in 1999 primarily
due to integration and interest costs incurred as a result of the fiscal 1998
western merger and the recapitalization at december 29 2001 the company has
cumulative net deferred income tax assets of 32096 the gross deferred income
tax assets include deferred tax assets of approximately 33000 related to the
excess tax basis over book value of the net assets obtained through the
discount acquisition the gross deferred income tax assets also include federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately 6596
these nols may be used to reduce future taxable income and expire periodically
through fiscal year 2020 the company believes it will realize these tax
benefits through a combination of the reversal of temporary differences
projected future taxable income during the nol carryforward periods and
available tax planning strategies due to uncertainties related to the
realization of certain deferred tax assets for nols in various jurisdictions
the company recorded a valuation allowance of 1554 as of december 29 2001
and 1510 as of december 30 2000 the amount of deferred income tax assets

   the postretirement benefit obligation was computed using an assumed discount
rate of 75 in 2001 and 2000 the health care cost trend rate was assumed to

60 for 2006 and 50 to 55 for 2007 and thereafter

    if the health care cost were increased 1 for all future years the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased by 2296 as
of december 29 2001 the effect of this change on the combined service and
interest cost would have been an increase of 185 for 2001

   if the health care cost were decreased 1 for all future years the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have decreased by 1996 as
of december 29 2001 the effect of this change on the combined service and
interest cost would have been a decrease of 160 for 2001
