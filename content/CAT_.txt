our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

the nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2021 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include case part of cnh industrial nv deere construction  forestry part of deere  company doosan infracore co ltd hitachi construction machinery co ltd hyundai construction equipment co ltd hyundai doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai construction equipment co ltd both part of hyundai heavy industries holdings co jc bamford excavators ltd kobelco construction machinery part of kobe steel ltd komatsu ltd kubota farm  industrial machinery part of kubota corporation and volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg construction machinery co ltd shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of the volvo group and shantui construction machinery co ltd part of shandong heavy industry group co each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements cat financial is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

  

cat financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate and duration of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio this matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move for more information regarding match funding please see note 4 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data see also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in item 1 a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “forecast” “target” “guide” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition 

covid19 was identified in late 2019 and spread globally efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and access to and acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines globally covid 19 has had and continues to have a significant impact around the world prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response such measures have included travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers dealers and suppliers although certain restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic have eased uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures current material and component shortages logistics constraints and labor inefficiencies have limited and could continue to limit our ability to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear the covid19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and customer demand uncertainty has caused inflationary pressure in the us and elsewhere and has led to volatility in customer demand for the company’s products and services and caused supply chain disruptions economic uncertainties could continue to affect customer demand for the company’s products and services the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers 

continued uncertainties related to the magnitude duration and persistent effects of the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our business these uncertainties include among other things the duration and impact of the resurgence in covid19 cases in any country state or region the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus the availability acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines prolonged reduction or closure of the company’s operations disruptions in the supply chain labor inefficiencies increased logistics costs the impact of the pandemic on the company’s customers and dealers the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets andor declines in our financial performance or credit ratings which could impact the company’s ability to obtain funding in the future and the impact of the pandemic on customer demand 

for our products and services as discussed above all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s financial and operational results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for the company’s products and services and the supply chain as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic the overall magnitude of the covid19 pandemic and the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations andor financial condition 

macroeconomic risks 

our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the mineral extraction oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products and services significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of labor and material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products production challenges at suppliers including suppliers of semiconductors a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer additionally we have experienced and expect to continue to experience transportation delays for parts components and finished machines due to significant demands in global transportation and congestion at ports throughout the globe our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways rail systems airports sewer and water systems waterways and dams tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in different regions and countries exposes us to numerous risks including 

• multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change 

• imposition of currency restrictions restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints 

• imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas 

• withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements 

• imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the us or foreign governments 

• war or acts of terrorism and 

• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our 

ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business customers dealers suppliers and employees operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks from threat actors globally range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products it is possible that our information technology systems and networks or those managed or provided by third parties could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing or which we cause or have caused thirdparty service providers to implement will be sufficient to protect and mitigate associated risks to our systems information or other property 

we have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks such prior events to date have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition due to the evolving nature of such security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack 

in addition data we collect store and process are subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act that became effective in january 2020 which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence among other things there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

• the failure to achieve the acquisitions revenue or profit forecast 

• the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture 

• technological and product synergies economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected 

• unforeseen expenses delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approvals or consents 

• we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions 

• faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process 

• unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations processes and systems 

• higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems including information technology systems accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting 

• we may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business 

• higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations and 

• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction including through guarantees or other financial arrangements lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism or violence civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness including the current covid19 outbreak equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar and cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies a downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature cat financial also could and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

• market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which could increase cat financial’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

• the process cat financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments 

• cat financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to engage or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 

• as cat financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions their ability to perform in accordance with any of our underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility andor disruptions in financial markets 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates certain loans made by cat financial and various financing extended to cat financial are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 on november 18 2020 ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of usd libor announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all gbp eur chf and jpy libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 on november 30 2020 iba with the support of the united states federal reserve and the fca announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for only the oneweek and twomonth usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while the november 30 announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established if libor continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be established the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to cat financial as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities loans and financial instruments cat financial has created a crossfunctional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of libor in securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us other changes in market interest rates may influence cat financial’s borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance however that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis however adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations 

  

we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currencyexchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements we expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to a widerange of trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations these include us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject we also cannot predict in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries expose us to the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees intermediaries acting on our behalf or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions violations may also disrupt our business and may result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between us and nonus jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates in addition our future results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonus jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 6 — “income taxes” and note 22 — “environmental and legal matters” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves such payments could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the united states for example certain cat financial activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as a result cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition changes in regulations or additional regulations in the united states or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our reputation business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our met operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products’ operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio during 2021 we had positive operating cash flow within both our met and financial products operations on a consolidated basis we ended 2021 with 925 billion of cash a decrease of 98 million from yearend 2020 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2021 was 720 billion up 871 million compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to profit before taxes adjusted for noncash items including higher accruals for shortterm incentive compensation in addition lower payments for shortterm incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements compared to last year within working capital changes in accounts receivable and inventory unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2021 was 3779 billion an increase of 626 million from yearend 2020 debt related to met decreased 137 billion in 2021 due to the repayment of maturing debt in addition during the first quarter of 2021 we issued 500 million of ten year bonds at 19 percent and utilized the net proceeds to redeem all our 500 million 26 percent notes due in 2022 debt related to financial products increased by 201 billion due to portfolio funding requirements 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on management’s allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2021 was 275 billion information on our credit facility is as follows 

• the 364day facility of 315 billion of which 825 million is available to met expires on september 1 2022 

• the threeyear facility as amended and restated in september 2021 of 273 billion of which 715 million is available to met expires in september 2024 

• the fiveyear facility as amended and restated in september 2021 of 462 billion of which 121 billion is available to met expires in september 2026 

at december 31 2021 caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was 1658 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2021 cat financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 251 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2021 cat financial’s sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 725 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 791 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2021 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2021 were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2021 totaled 325 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s fitch and sp maintain a “mida” debt rating a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable met’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our committed credit facilities our financial products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios 

we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs the “programs” through participating financial institutions the programs are available to a wide range of suppliers and allows them the option to manage their cash flow we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the programs the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the programs the amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the programs and included in accounts payable in the consolidated statement of financial position were 822 million and 533 million at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the amounts settled through the programs and paid to participating financial institutions were 41 billion and 32 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively we account for payments made under the programs the same as our other accounts payable as a reduction to our cash flows from operations we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity 

material cash requirements for contractual obligations 

we believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of 925 billion and time deposits of 964 million as of december 31 2021 along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond 

we have committed cash outflow related to postretirement benefit obligations longterm debt and operating lease agreements see notes 12 14 and 20 respectively of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional information 

we have shortterm obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business these cons ist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of december 31 2021 but scheduled for payment in 2022 of 815 billion in addition we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at december 31 2021 but not yet invoiced or delivered of 728 billion 

we also have longterm contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements systems support software licenses and development contracts information technology consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration these obligations total 116 billion with 550 million due in the next 12 months 

machinery energy  transportation 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 718 billion in 2021 compared with 405 billion in 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for noncash items which included higher accruals for shortterm incentive compensation in addition lower payments for shortterm incentive compensation favorably impacted cash flow partially offsetting these items were increased working capital requirements within working capital changes in inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 

net cash used for investing activities in 2021 was 123 billion compared with net cash used of 134 billion in 2020 the change was primarily due to increased activity related to intercompany lending with financial products mostly offset by increased investments in securities during 2021 we invested 119 billion in bank time deposits with varying maturity dates within one year and received proceeds from time deposits that matured of 225 million we also acquired the oil  gas division of the weir group plc for 359 million net of cash acquired in february 2021 

net cash used for financing activities during 2021 was 630 billion compared with net cash used of 118 billion in 2020 the change was primarily due to the repayment of debt and lower proceeds from the issuance of debt in addition we repurchased 267 billion of caterpillar common stock in 2021 compared to 113 billion in 2020 

  

while our shortterm priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate our longterm cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating next we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments then we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases additional information on cash deployment is as follows 

  

strong financial position — our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity leverage cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies 

operational excellence and commitments — capital expenditures were 113 billion during 2021 compared to 994 million in 2020 we expect met’s capital expenditures in 2022 to be around 14 billion we made 340 million of contributions to our opeb plans during 2021 by comparison we made 262 million of contributions to our opeb plans in 2020 we expect to make approximately 357 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2022 

  

fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — we intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive longterm profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services including acquisitions 

as part of our capital allocation strategy met free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases we define met free cash flow as cash from met operations excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions less capital expenditures a goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all met free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases while maintaining our mida rating 

our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities in july 2018 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2018 authorization effective january 1 2019 with no expiration in 2021 we repurchased 267 billion of caterpillar common stock with 210 billion remaining under the 2018 authorization as of december 31 2021 caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2021 were approximately 536 million 

each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend in december 2021 the board of directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing 111 per share and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend dividends paid totaled 233 billion in 2021 

financial products 

  

financial products operating cash flow was 142 billion in 2021 compared with 127 billion in 2020 net cash used for investing activities was 140 billion in 2021 compared with net cash provided by investing activities of 791 million in 2020 the change was primarily due to portfolio related activity net cash provided by financing activities was 257 million in 2021 compared with net cash used of 250 billion in 2020 the change was primarily due to higher portfolio funding requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are a party to certain offbalance sheet arrangements primarily in the form of guarantees information related to guarantees appears in note 21 – “guarantees and product warranty” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests warranty liability reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments we review these assumptions at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets – we determine the residual value of cat financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated endofterm market value we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors including historical wholesale market sales prices past remarketing experience and any known significant marketproduct trends we also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates lease term market size and demand total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options 

upon termination of the lease the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price 

during the term of our leases we monitor residual values for operating leases we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2021 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 187 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 percent nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 85 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value we do not consider the goodwill impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss 

for reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value we compute the residual value using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures we categorize the fair value determination as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

we completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the mineral extraction oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test we would report a goodwill impairment as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

warranty liability – at the time we recognize a sale we record estimated future warranty costs we determine the warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america we develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels the amount of these reserves totaled 12 billion at both december 31 2021 and 2020 the majority of the balance in both 2021 and 2020 consisted of unearned insurance premiums 

  

postretirement benefits – we sponsor defined benefit pension plans andor other postretirement benefit plans retirement healthcare and life insurance to employees in many of our locations throughout the world there are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increase the future health care trend rate mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions the actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we utilize a marktomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

• we use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars the us discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date december 31 the benefit cash flowmatching approach involves analyzing caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve calculated using a wide population of corporate aa bonds available on the measurement date we use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant nonus plans in estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate this approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense 

• the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of longterm passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets based on historical performance we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets this rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions but because it represents a longterm rate it is not significantly impacted by shortterm market swings changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate for example a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate a decrease in the rate would increase our expense the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan assets allocations as of our measurement date december 31 

• we use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement it represents average longterm salary increases this rate is influenced by our longterm compensation policies an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense 

• the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care eg technology driven cost changes will impact this trend rate an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense 

• we use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

the effects of a one percentagepoint change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2021 pension and opeb costs and obligations are as follows 

  

  



actuarial assumptions 



see note 12  “postemployment benefit plans” of part ii item 8 “financial statement and supplemental data” for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 14 billion at both december 31 2021 and 2020 the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly we adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

allowance for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses is management’s estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industryspecific economic factors in addition we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including borrowerspecific and companyspecific factors these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

we measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist we identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by caterpillar sarl csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 23 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit as a result no amount related to these irs adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we give less weight in this analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

the table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and includes expected cost for 2022 



1 expected net periodic benefit cost benefit does not include an estimate for marktomarket gains or losses 



• expected increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021  excluding the impact of marktomarket gains and losses our net periodic benefit cost is expected to increase 168 million in 2022 the expected increase is primarily due to changes in assumptions causing higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at yearend 2021 us pension plans discount rate for 2022 interest cost is 23 compared to 18 for 2021 and lower expected return on plan assets in 2022 us pension plans expected return on plans assets is 40 percent for 2022 compared to 42 percent in 2021 

• decrease in expense in 2021 compared to 2020  primarily due to marktomarket gains in 2021 compared to marktomarket losses in 2020 and lower interest cost in 2021 as a result of lower discount rates at yearend 2020 

• decrease in expense in 2020 compared to 2019  primarily due to lower interest cost in 2020 as a result of lower discount rates at yearend 2019 the elimination of service cost for our us pension plans freezing benefit accruals and lower marktomarket losses in 2020 compared to 2019 

the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses gains for 2021 2020 and 2019 are described below we include the net marktomarket losses gains in other income expense in the results of operations 

• 2021 net marktomarket gain of 833 million  primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020 this was partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of 36 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 42 percent 

• 2020 net marktomarket loss of 383 million  primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019 this was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of 167 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 51 percent 

• 2019 net marktomarket loss of 468 million  primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 this was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of 223 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 59 percent 

sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

met operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our met operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2022 cash flow for our met operations by approximately 89 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 126 million adverse impact on 2021 cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

in managing foreign currency risk for our financial products operations our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the australian dollar chinese yuan euro japanese yen and swiss franc 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our met operations we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate contracts to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2022 pretax earnings of met last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2021 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate and duration of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2021 balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2022 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2021 pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

we provide the following definitions for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of two significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i pension and opeb marktomarket gains losses resulting from plan remeasurements and ii restructuring income costs which were incurred to generate longerterm benefits we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our periodoverperiod results in addition we provide a calculation of met free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases 

reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable gaap measures are as follows 





reconciliations of met free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities are as follows

other information about our operations in 2020 including certain risks associated with our operations is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

the nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2020 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include case part of cnh industrial nv deere construction  forestry part of deere  company doosan infracore co ltd hitachi construction machinery co ltd hyundai construction equipment co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd kobelco construction machinery part of kobe steel ltd komatsu ltd kubota farm  industrial machinery part of kubota corporation and volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg construction machinery co ltd shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of the volvo group and shantui construction machinery co ltd part of shandong heavy industry group co each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail loans totaling 49 percent include

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2020 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 7 — “cat financial financing activities” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include australia and new zealand banking group limited banc of america leasing  capital llc bnp paribas leasing solutions limited wells fargo equipment finance inc societe general and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as john deere capital corporation komatsu financial lp kubota credit corporation and volvo financial services which utilize many belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements cat financial is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

  

cat financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio this matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move for more information regarding match funding please see note 4 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data see also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in item 1 a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience customer financial information credit ratings loantovalue ratios and other internal metrics cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to these agreements the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory the company establishes prices to dealers after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice

employment 

management aligns employment levels with the needs of the business we believe we have the appropriate human capital resources to successfully operate and deliver our enterprise strategy as of december 31 2020 we employed about 97300 fulltime persons of whom approximately 57000 were located outside the united states in the united states we employed approximately 40300 fulltime persons most of whom are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units we have hired certain highly specialized employees under employment contracts that specify a term of employment pay and other benefits 

  

as of december 31 2020 there were approximately 6900 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions including the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw the international association of machinists and the united steelworkers outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

  

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item accrued expenses in statement 3 — consolidated financial position at december 31 of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “forecast” “target” “guide” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition 

covid19 was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally the rapid spread has resulted in weaker demand and constrained supply and the implementation of numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these factors have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations 

the covid19 pandemic caused a global recession and it is uncertain when a sustained economic recovery may occur the covid19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to a decrease in demand for the company’s products and services and caused supply chain disruptions economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for the company’s products and services the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers 

uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic including new strains may significantly adversely affect our business these uncertainties include the duration and impact of the resurgence in covid19 cases in any country state or region prolonged reduction or closure of the company’s operations or a delayed recovery in our operations disruptions in the supply chain increased logistics costs the impact of the pandemic on the company’s customers and dealers the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets andor declines in our financial performance or credit ratings which could impact the company’s ability to obtain funding in the future and the impact of the pandemic on demand for our products and services as discussed above it is unclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s financial and operational results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for the company’s products and services and the supply chain as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic the overall magnitude of the covid19 pandemic and the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations andor financial condition 

macroeconomic risks 

our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products production challenges at suppliers including suppliers of semiconductors a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer additionally we have experienced and expect to continue to experience transportation delays for parts components and finished machines due to significant demands in global transportation and congestion at ports throughout the globe our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways rail systems airports sewer and water systems waterways and dams tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

• multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change 

• imposition of currency restrictions restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints 

• imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas 

• withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements 

• imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the us or foreign governments 

• war or acts of terrorism and 

• political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business customers dealers suppliers and employees operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products it is possible that our information technology systems and networks or those managed or provided by third parties could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property 

we have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks such prior events to date have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition due to the evolving nature of such security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack 

in addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence among other things there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

• the failure to achieve the acquisitions revenue or profit forecast 

• the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture 

• technological and product synergies economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected 

• unforeseen expenses delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approvals or consents 

• we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions 

• faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process 

• unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations processes and systems 

• higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems including information technology systems accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting 

• we may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business 

• higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations and 

• we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction including through guarantees or other financial arrangements lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism or violence civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness including the current covid19 outbreak equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar and cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s 

long and shortterm ratings of caterpillar and cat financial are a3 and prime2 “lowa” while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mida” debt rating a downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

• market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which could impact cat financial’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

• the process cat financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments 

• cat financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 

• as cat financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility andor disruptions in financial markets 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates certain loans made by cat financial and various financing extended to cat financial are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 on november 18 2020 ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of usd libor announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all gbp eur chf and jpy libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 on november 30 2020 iba with the support of the united states federal reserve and the fca announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for only the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while the november 30th announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established such that libor continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rates several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to cat financial as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities loans and financial instruments cat financial has created a crossfunctional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of libor in securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us other changes in market interest rates may influence cat financial’s borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance however that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations 

  

we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected we expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law our assumptions for future benefit payments may change over time and could be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to a widerange of trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries expose us to the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees intermediaries acting on our behalf or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between us and nonus jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonus jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 6 — “income taxes” and note 22 — “environmental and legal matters” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the united states for example certain cat financial activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as a result cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition changes in regulations or additional regulations in the united states or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our reputation business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under item 1a risk factors of the 2020 form 10k 

overview 

our sales and revenues for 2020 were 41748 billion a decrease of 12052 billion or 22 percent compared with 53800 billion in 2019 the decline was due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories across the three primary segments sales were lower across all regions and in the three primary segments profit per share was 546 in 2020 compared with profit per share of 1074 in 2019 profit was 2998 billion in 2020 compared with 6093 billion in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume unfavorable price realization  lower profit from financial products and higher restructuring costs  partially offset by lower selling general and administrative sga and research and development rd expenses and favorable manufacturing costs 

fourthquarter 2020 sales and revenues were 11235 billion down 1909 billion or 15 percent from 13144 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 fourthquarter 2020 profit was 142 per share compared with 197 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 fourthquarter 2020 profit was 780 million compared with 1098 billion in 2019

2020 compared with 2019 

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2019 at left and 2020 at right caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues for 2020 were 41748 billion a decrease of 12052 billion or 22 percent compared with 53800 billion in 2019 the decline was due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories across the three primary segments dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about 29 billion during 2020 compared with an increase of about 800 million during 2019 

sales were lower across all regions and in the three primary segments 

north america sales declined 31 percent driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories during 2020 compared with an increase during 2019 

sales decreased 28 percent in latin america due to lower sales volume across the region driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories in addition sales were lower due to unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker brazilian real dealers decreased inventories during 2020 and increased inventories during 2019 

eame sales decreased 12 percent due to lower sales volume in most countries across the region driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than 2019 

asiapacific sales decreased 16 percent due to lower demand across the region lower demand was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower enduser demand dealers decreased inventories during 2020 and increased inventories during 2019 

dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about 29 billion during 2020 compared with an increase of about 800 million during 2019 dealers are independent and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers we do not expect a significant dealer inventory reduction in 2021 





consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2019 at left and 2020 at right caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit was 4553 billion in 2020 a decrease of 3737 billion or 45 percent compared with 8290 billion in 2019 the decrease was due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization partially offset by lower sgard expenses and favorable manufacturing costs 

lower sgard expenses reflected reduced shortterm incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes 

favorable manufacturing costs were mostly driven by lower period manufacturing costs and material costs partially offset by higher warranty expense period manufacturing costs declined primarily due to a reduction in shortterm incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually in the first quarter in response to the continued global economic uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic caterpillar suspended 2020 shortterm incentive compensation plans for many employees and all senior executives as a result no shortterm incentive compensation expense was recognized during 2020 compared with about 700 million during 2019 

for 2021 we expect shortterm incentive compensation expense will be about 900 million 

operating profit margin was 109 percent in 2020 compared with 154 percent in 2019 



other profitloss and tax items 

• interest expense excluding financial products in 2020 was 514 million compared with 421 million in 2019 the increase was due to higher average debt outstanding during 2020 compared with 2019 

other incomeexpense in 2020 was expense of 44 million compared with expense of 57 million in 2019 the change was due to a higher expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit opeb costs that include lower marktomarket losses for remeasurement of pension and opeb plans partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange gains losses lower investment and interest income and the absence of realized gains that occurred in 2019 

• the provision for income taxes for 2020 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 278 percent compared with 25 percent for 2019 excluding the discrete items discussed in the following paragraph the increase from 2019 primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective 

the provision for income taxes for 2020 also included the following 

◦ a tax benefit of 80 million to adjust prior year us taxes including the impact of regulations received in 2020 compared to 178 million in 2019 

◦ a tax benefit of 82 million related to 383 million of pension and opeb marktomarket losses in 2020 compared to a 105 million tax benefit related to 468 million of marktomarket losses in 2019 

◦ a tax benefit of 49 million in 2020 compared with 41 million in 2019 for the settlement of stockbased compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative us gaap compensation expense 

construction industries 

construction industries’ total sales were 16918 billion in 2020 a decrease of 5731 billion or 25 percent compared with 22649 billion in 2019 the decrease was due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories during 2020 compared with an increase during 2019 

• in north america sales decreased mostly due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories during 2020 compared with an increase during 2019

construction industries’ profit was 2373 billion in 2020 a decrease of 1558 billion or 40 percent compared with 3931 billion in 2019 the decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization primarily due to the geographic mix of sales partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs and lower sgard expenses favorable manufacturing costs were primarily due to lower period manufacturing costs material costs and favorable cost absorption partially offset by higher warranty expense cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased in 2019 compared with inventory that was about flat in 2020 lower sgard expenses and period manufacturing costs both reflected a reduction in shortterm incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes 

construction industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 140 percent in 2020 compared with 174 percent in 2019 

resource industries 

resource industries’ total sales were 7906 billion in 2020 a decrease of 2370 billion or 23 percent compared with 10276 billion in 2019 the decrease was due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories during 2020 compared with an increase during 2019 lower enduser demand was primarily driven by equipment supporting heavy construction and quarry and aggregates mining equipment enduser demand and aftermarket parts demand were also down in 2020 though to a lesser extent mining equipment sales were impacted by mining company delays in capital expenditures due to pricing in certain commodities and overall economic uncertainty 

resource industries’ profit was 896 million in 2020 a decrease of 733 million or 45 percent compared with 1629 billion in 2019 the decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs favorable manufacturing costs were mostly due to lower period manufacturing costs and material costs partially offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption lower period manufacturing costs were driven by lower shortterm incentive compensation expense other costreduction actions implemented in response to lower sales volumes and the benefits of prior restructuring programs cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased during 2019 compared with inventory levels that were about flat during 2020 

resource industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 113 percent for 2020 compared with 159 percent for 2019 

energy  transportation 



energy  transportation’s total sales were 17470 billion in 2020 a decrease of 4627 billion or 21 percent compared with 22097 billion in 2019 sales declined across all applications and intersegment engine sales 

• oil and gas – sales decreased mainly due to lower demand in north america for reciprocating engines used in gas compression and decreased sales of engine aftermarket parts and lower sales of turbines and turbinerelated services across most regions 

• power generation – sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume for reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts as well as lower sales in turbines and turbinerelated services 

• industrial – sales decreased due to lower demand across all regions 

• transportation – sales declined in rail due to lower rail services and deliveries of locomotives primarily in north america and in marine applications primarily in eame and asiapacific 

energy  transportation’s profit was 2405 billion in 2020 a decrease of 1505 billion or 38 percent compared with 3910 billion in 2019 the decrease was due to lower sales volume partially offset by lower sgard expenses and manufacturing costs sgard expenses and manufacturing costs were both impacted by a reduction in shortterm incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes in addition segment profit was unfavorably impacted by increased restructuring costs and certain asset impairments 

energy  transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 138 percent in 2020 compared with 177 percent in 2019 

financial products segment 

financial products’ segment revenues were 3044 billion in 2020 a decrease of 390 million or 11 percent from 2019 the decrease was primarily because of lower average financing rates across all regions and lower average earning assets in north america

at the end of 2020 past dues at cat financial were 349 percent compared with 314 percent at the end of 2019 past dues increased primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by decreases in the caterpillar power finance eame and latin american portfolios writeoffs net of recoveries were 222 million for 2020 compared with 237 million for 2019 as of december 31 2020 cat financials allowance for credit losses totaled 479 million or 177 percent of finance receivables compared with 424 million or 150 percent of finance receivables at december 31 2019

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2019 at left and the fourth quarter of 2020 at right caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 were 11235 billion a decrease of 1909 billion or 15 percent compared with 13144 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the decline was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2019 

sales were lower across the three primary segments with the largest decline in energy  transportation 

the largest sales decrease was in north america which declined 22 percent due to lower sales volume driven by lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2019 

sales decreased 9 percent in latin america primarily due to the unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker brazilian real 

eame sales decreased 11 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for equipment and aftermarket parts partially offset by favorable currency impacts from a stronger euro and price realization 

asiapacific sales decreased 8 percent primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization partially offset by favorable currency impacts from a stronger australian dollar and chinese yuan sales volume declined due to lower enduser demand and the impact from changes in dealer inventories dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2019 

dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about 1100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a decrease of about 700 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 dealers are independent and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 





consolidated operating profit

operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 1380 billion a decrease of 470 million or 25 percent compared with 1850 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and sgard expenses in addition operating profit declined due to lower profit from financial products 

manufacturing costs were lower due to favorable impact from cost absorption lower material and period manufacturing costs partially offset by higher warranty expense cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2020 

sgard expenses and period manufacturing costs benefited from reduced shortterm incentive compensation expense and other cost reductions related to lower sales volumes partially offset by higher labor and benefits costs 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually in the first quarter in response to the continued global economic uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic caterpillar suspended 2020 shortterm incentive compensation plans for many employees and all senior executives as a result no shortterm incentive compensation expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with about 120 million in the fourth quarter of 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our met operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products’ operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio during 2020 we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our met and financial products operations on a consolidated basis we ended 2020 with 935 billion of cash an increase of 107 billion from yearend 2019 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2020 was 633 billion down 585 million compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to profit adjusted for noncash items including lower accruals for shortterm incentive compensation and postretirement benefits partially offsetting lower profit were the absence of a discretionary pension contribution reduced working capital requirements and lower payments for shortterm incentive compensation during 2020 within working capital changes to accounts receivable and accounts payable favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accrued expenses inventories and customer advances see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2020 was 3716 billion a decrease of 494 million from yearend 2019 debt related to financial products decreased 251 billion while debt related to met increased 202 billion in 2020 the increase was due to the issuance of new debt to maintain our strong financial position and increase liquidity in april 2020 we issued 800 million of tenyear bonds at 26 percent and 12 billion of 30year bonds at 325 percent 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on management’s allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2020 was 275 billion information on our credit facility is as follows 

• the 364day facility of 315 billion of which 082 billion is available to met expires in september 2021 

• the threeyear facility as amended and restated in september 2019 of 273 billion of which 072 billion is available to met expires in september 2022 

• the fiveyear facility as amended and restated in september 2019 of 462 billion of which 121 billion is available to met expires in september 2024 

at december 31 2020 caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was 1541 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2020 cat financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 172 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2020 cat financial’s sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 674 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 695 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2020 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2020 were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2020 totaled 318 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

since the outbreak of the covid19 global pandemic caterpillar has taken actions to maintain our strong financial position and increase liquidity during 2020 we raised 20 billion of incremental cash by issuing 800 million of tenyear bonds at 26 percent and 12 billion of 30year bonds at 325 percent we also entered into an incremental 39 billion shortterm credit facility that was set to expire on december 31 2020 and registered for 42 billion in commercial paper support programs available in the united states and canada in addition cat financial issued 325 billion of mediumterm notes to refinance maturing mediumterm notes and supplement its liquidity position due to our strong liquidity position we chose to early terminate the 39 billion shortterm credit facility on september 2 2020 we also do not have any outstanding borrowings under either commercial paper support program as of the date of this filing 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s rates our debt as “lowa” while fitch and sp maintain a “mida” debt rating this split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health however a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable met’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios 

we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs the “programs” through participating financial institutions the programs are available to a wide range of suppliers and allows them the option to manage their cash flow we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the programs the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the programs the amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the programs and included in accounts payable in the consolidated statement of financial position were 533 million and 575 million at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively the amounts settled through the programs and paid to participating financial institutions were 32 billion and 41 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively we account for payments made under the programs the same as our other accounts payable as a reduction to our cash flows from operations we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity 

machinery energy  transportation 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 405 billion in 2020 compared with 487 billion in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2020 adjusted for noncash items which included lower accruals for shortterm compensation payments and postretirement benefits partially offsetting lower profit were the absence of a discretionary pension contribution lower payments for shortterm incentive compensation and reduced working capital requirements within working capital changes to accounts payable and accounts receivable favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes in accrued expenses inventories and customer advances 

net cash used for investing activities in 2020 was 134 billion compared with net cash used of 48 million in 2019 the change was primarily due to increased intercompany lending with financial products during 2020 

net cash used for financing activities during 2020 was 118 billion compared with net cash used of 448 billion in 2019 the change was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases of 292 billion and greater proceeds from the issuance of debt of 512 million compared to 2019 

  

while our shortterm priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate our longterm cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating next we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments then we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases additional information on cash deployment is as follows 

  

strong financial position — our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity leverage cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies 

operational excellence and commitments — capital expenditures were 994 million during 2020 compared to 107 billion in 2019 we expect met’s capital expenditures in 2021 to be between 10 billion and 12 billion we made 262 million of contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2020 by comparison we made 181 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in 2019 including a 15 billion discretionary contribution made to our us pension plans we expect to make approximately 310 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2021 

  

fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — we intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive longterm profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services including acquisitions 

as part of our capital allocation strategy met free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases we define met free cash flow as cash from met operations excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions less capital expenditures a goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all met free cash flow to shareholders through the cycles in the form of dividends and share repurchases while maintaining our mida rating 

our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities in july 2018 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2018 authorization effective january 1 2019 with no expiration in 2020 we repurchased 113 billion of caterpillar common stock with 482 billion remaining under the 2018 authorization as of december 31 2020 caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2020 were approximately 545 million due to current economic uncertainty we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in 2020 the existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the board and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending upon market conditions our capital needs and other factors 

each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend in december 2020 the board of directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing 103 per share and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend dividends paid totaled 224 billion in 2020

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests warranty liability reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments we review these assumptions at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets – we determine the residual value of cat financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated endofterm market value we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors including historical wholesale market sales prices past remarketing experience and any known significant marketproduct trends we also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates lease term market size and demand total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options 

upon termination of the lease the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price 

during the term of our leases we monitor residual values for operating leases we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2020 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 207 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 percent nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 95 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value we do not consider the goodwill impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value we recognize the difference as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value we compute the residual value using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity we support the income approach by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the company’s market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures we categorize the fair value determination as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test we would report a goodwill impairment as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

warranty liability – at the time we recognize a sale we record estimated future warranty costs we determine the warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america we develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels the amount of these reserves totaled 12 billion and 11 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the majority of the balance in both 2020 and 2019 consisted of unearned insurance premiums 

  

postretirement benefits – we sponsor defined benefit pension plans andor other postretirement benefit plans retirement healthcare and life insurance to employees in many of our locations throughout the world there are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increase the future health care trend rate mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions the actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we utilize a marktomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

• we use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars the us discount rate is based on a benefit cash flowmatching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date december 31 the benefit cash flowmatching approach involves analyzing caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve calculated using a wide population of corporate aa bonds available on the measurement date we use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant nonus plans in estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate this approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows 

discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense 

• the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of longterm passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets based on historical performance we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets this rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions but because it represents a longterm rate it is not significantly impacted by shortterm market swings changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate for example a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate a decrease in the rate would increase our expense the expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date december 31 

• we use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement it represents average longterm salary increases this rate is influenced by our longterm compensation policies an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense 

• the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care eg technology driven cost changes will impact this trend rate an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense 

• we use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

the effects of a one percentagepoint change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2020 pension and opeb costs and obligations are as follows 

  

  



actuarial assumptions 



see note 12  “postemployment benefit plans” of part ii item 8 “financial statement and supplemental data” for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 14 billion and 17 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly we adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

allowance for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses is management’s estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industryspecific economic factors in addition we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including borrowerspecific and companyspecific factors these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

we measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist we identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by caterpillar sarl csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 23 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit as a result no amount related to these irs adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we give less weight in this analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

the table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively and includes expected cost for 2021 



1 expected net periodic benefit cost benefit does not include an estimate for marktomarket gains or losses 



• expected decrease in expense in 2021 compared to 2020  excluding the impact of marktomarket gains and losses our net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease 145 million in 2021 this expected decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost in 2021 as a result of lower discount rates at yearend 2020 partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets in 2021 us pension plans expected return on plans assets is 42 percent for 2021 compared to 51 percent in 2020 

• decrease in expense in 2020 compared to 2019  primarily due to lower interest cost in 2020 as a result of lower discount rates at yearend 2019 the elimination of service cost for our us pension plans freezing benefit accruals and lower marktomarket losses in 2020 compared to 2019 

• increase in expense in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an expected rate of return of 59 percent in 2019 compared to 63 percent in 2018 and higher interest costs due to higher discount rates at yearend 2018 

the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses for 2020 2019 and 2018 are described below we include the net marktomarket losses in other income expense in the results of operations 

• 2020 net marktomarket loss of 383 million  primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019 this was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan 

assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of 167 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 51 percent 

• 2019 net marktomarket loss of 468 million  primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 this was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of 223 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 59 percent 

• 2018 net marktomarket loss of 495 million  primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets us pension plans had an actual rate of return of negative 54 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 63 percent this was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017 

sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

met operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our met operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2021 cash flow for our met operations by approximately 126 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 225 million adverse impact on 2020 cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

in managing foreign currency risk for our financial products operations our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the australian dollar chinese yuan japanese yen euro and swiss franc 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our met operations we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate contracts to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2021 pretax earnings of met last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2020 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate and duration of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2020 balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2021 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2020 pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

we provide the following definitions for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of three significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i pension and opeb marktomarket losses resulting from plan remeasurements ii restructuring costs which were incurred to generate longerterm benefits and iii us tax reform impact in 2019 we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our periodoverperiod results in addition we provide a calculation of met free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases 

reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable gaap measures are as follows 







reconciliations of met free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities are as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis we have grouped the data as follows 

  

consolidated – caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries

business 

tableend 

general 

  

originally organized as caterpillar tractor co in 1925 in the state of california our company was reorganized as caterpillar inc in 1986 in the state of delaware as used herein the term “caterpillar” “we” “us” “our” or “the company” refers to caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise 

  

overview 

  

with 2019 sales and revenues of 53800 billion  caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company principally operates through its three primary segments  construction industries resource industries and energy  transportation  and also provides financing and related services through its financial products segment caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

currently we have five operating segments of which four are reportable segments and are described below 

  

categories of business organization 

  

1   machinery energy  transportation — represents the aggregate total of construction industries resource industries energy  transportation and all other operating segment and related corporate items and eliminations 

  

2   financial products — primarily includes the company’s financial products segment this category includes caterpillar financial services corporation cat financial caterpillar insurance holdings inc insurance services and their respective subsidiaries 

  

other information about our operations in 2019  including certain risks associated with our operations is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

  

the nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2019 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include case part of cnh industrial nv deere construction  forestry part of deere  company doosan infracore co ltd hitachi construction machinery co ltd hyundai construction equipment co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd kobelco construction machinery part of kobe steel ltd komatsu ltd kubota farm  industrial machinery part of kubota corporation and volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg group shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of the volvo group and shantui construction machinery co ltd part of shandong heavy industry group co each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products however increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

patents and trademarks

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 46 located in the united states and 119 located outside the united states serving 191 countries reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 67 distributors covering 178 countries the fg wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 80 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segment there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to these agreements the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item accrued expenses in statement 3 — consolidated financial position at december 31 of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “forecast” “target” “guide” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

macroeconomic risks 

our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products production challenges at suppliers a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways rail systems airports sewer and water systems waterways and dams tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union commonly known as “brexit” some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business customers dealers suppliers and employees operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products it is possible that our information technology systems and networks or those managed by third parties could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time while various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property 

we have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks such prior events to date have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition due to the evolving nature of such security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack 

in addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence among other things there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction including through guarantees or other financial arrangements lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism or violence civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness including the current covid19 outbreak equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar and cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s 

long and shortterm ratings of caterpillar and cat financial are a3 and prime2 “lowa” while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mida” debt rating a downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

 

 

 



changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates certain loans made by cat financial and various financing extended to cat financial are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established such that libor continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rates several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to cat financial as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities loans and financial instruments cat financial has created a crossfunctional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of libor in securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us the team is also closely monitoring the progress of libor reform and preparing to incorporate appropriate fallback language for transitioning to an alternative reference rates into new agreements with customers the team is reviewing how to best manage those customer agreements that extend beyond 2021 and utilize libor other changes in market interest rates may influence cat financial’s borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance however that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations 

  

we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected we expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law our assumptions for future benefit payments may change over time and could be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to a widerange of trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries expose us to the the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees intermediaries acting on our behalf or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between us and nonus jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonus jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 6 — “income taxes” and note 22 — “environmental and legal matters” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the united states for example certain cat financial activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as a result cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition changes in regulations or additional regulations in the united states or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financial ’ s and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our reputation business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

tableend   

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under item 1a risk factors of the 2019 form 10k 

overview 

our sales and revenues for 2019 were 53800 billion a 2 percent decrease from 2018 sales and revenues of 54722 billion the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume  the sales volume decline was mostly due to changes in dealer inventories partially offset by higher enduser demand sales were lower in eame and asiapacific while north america and latin america were about flat sales declined in energy  transportation and construction industries  while resource industries was about flat profit per share for 2019 was 1074 compared to profit per share of 1026 in 2018 profit was 6093 billion in 2019 compared with 6147 billion in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to higher tax expense as operating profit was about flat operating profit was about flat as favorable price realization  lower selling general and administrative sga and research and development rd expenses and higher financial products’ profit were offset by higher manufacturing costs  lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts 

fourthquarter 2019 sales and revenues were 13144 billion down 1198 billion or 8 percent from 14342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 fourthquarter 2019 profit was 197 per share compared with 178 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 fourthquarter 2019 profit was 1098 billion compared with 1048 billion in 2018 

highlights for 2019 include 

 

 notes 



2019 compared with 2018 

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2018 at left and 2019 at right caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues were 53800 billion in 2019 a decrease of 922 million or 2 percent compared with 54722 billion in 2018 the decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories partially offset by higher enduser demand unfavorable currency impacts primarily from a weaker euro australian dollar chinese yuan and brazilian real were mostly offset by favorable price realization sales decreased in energy  transportation and construction industries while resource industries was about flat sales decreased in eame and asiapacific while north america and latin america were about flat 

north america sales were about flat compared with prior year as favorable price realization was mostly offset by lower sales volume sales volume declined primarily due to changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than 2019 partially offset by higher enduser demand 

sales were about flat in latin america as higher sales volume was offset by an unfavorable currency impact from a weaker brazilian real sales volume increased due to higher enduser demand which was mostly offset by changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than 2019 

eame sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro partially offset by higher price realization the decrease in sales volume was primarily due to changes in dealer inventories dealers increased inventories during 2018 and decreased inventories during 2019 

asiapacific sales declined 4 percent primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of a weaker australian dollar and chinese yuan and lower sales volume sales volume decreased due to changes in dealer inventories partially offset by higher enduser demand dealer inventories increased more during 2018 than 2019 

dealer machine and engine inventories increased about 23 billion in 2018 compared with an increase of about 800 million in 2019 dealers are independent and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers we expect dealer inventories to decline about 10 to 15 billion during 2020 





consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2018 at left and 2019 at right caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit was 8290 billion in 2019 about flat with 8293 billion in 2018 favorable price realization mostly offset higher manufacturing costs lower sales volume offset favorable selling general and administrative sga and research and development rd expenses and higher profit from financial products 

manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense increased variable labor and burden unfavorable cost absorption and higher material costs cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased during 2018 compared with a decrease during 2019 the increase was partially offset by lower period manufacturing costs driven by lower shortterm incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of restructuring and costreduction actions 

sgard expenses decreased due to lower shortterm incentive compensation expense partially offset by investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually shortterm incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about 14 billion compared with about 700 million in 2019 

for 2020 we expect shortterm incentive compensation expense will be about 800 million we also expect lower manufacturing costs 

operating profit margin was 154 percent in 2019 compared with 152 percent in 2018 



other profitloss and tax items 

 the provision for income taxes also included the following 

 construction industries 

construction industries’ total sales were 22649 billion for 2019 a decrease of 588 million or 3 percent compared with 23237 billion for 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories partially offset by higher enduser demand dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2019 favorable price realization was offset by unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker euro chinese yuan and australian dollar 

sales increased in north america and latin america and decreased in asiapacific and eame 



 construction industries’ profit was 3931 billion in 2019 a decrease of 243 million or 6 percent compared with 4174 billion in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume including an unfavorable mix of products and higher manufacturing costs which were partially offset by favorable price realization and lower sgard expenses manufacturing costs increased primarily due to unfavorable variable labor and burden lower sgard expenses were due to lower shortterm incentive compensation expense partially offset by investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives 

construction industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 174 percent in 2019 compared with 180 percent in 2018 

resource industries 

resource industries’ total sales were 10276 billion in 2019 about flat with 10270 billion in 2018 higher enduser demand for equipment and favorable price realization were offset by changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable currency impacts primarily the weaker australian dollar and euro higher enduser demand was driven by increased capital investment by mining customers to support ongoing mine site operations enduser demand also increased for our nonresidential construction and quarry and aggregate customers dealers increased inventories more significantly during 2018 than during 2019 

resource industries’ profit was 1629 billion in 2019 an increase of 26 million or 2 percent compared with 1603 billion in 2018 the improvement was mostly due to favorable price realization partially offset by higher manufacturing costs manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense unfavorable cost absorption increased variable labor and burden and higher material costs partially offset by the favorable period manufacturing costs due to the impact of restructuring and costreduction actions and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased more during 2018 than 2019 

resource industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 159 percent in 2019 compared with 156 percent in 2018 

energy  transportation 



energy  transportation’s total sales were 22097 billion in 2019 compared with 22785 billion in 2018 sales declined primarily due to lower intersegment engine sales and unfavorable currency impacts primarily from the weaker euro and australian dollar 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 3910 billion for 2019 a decrease of 28 million or 1 percent compared with 3938 billion for 2018 the decrease was mostly due to lower sales volumes partially offset by lower sgard expenses lower sgard expenses were primarily due to lower shortterm incentive compensation expense higher manufacturing costs were more than offset by favorable price realization and favorable other operating income expenses 

energy  transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 177 percent in 2019 compared with 173 percent in 2018 

financial products segment

manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs partially offset by lower warranty expense material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices the impact of tariffs on material costs was about 110 million during 2018 freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our met operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products’ operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio during 2019 we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our met and financial products operations on a consolidated basis we ended 2019 with 828 billion of cash an increase of 427 million from yearend 2018 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2019 was 691 billion up from 656 billion in 2018 the increase was due to favorable changes in working capital in 2019 mostly offset by lower profit adjusted for noncash items which included lower accruals for shortterm incentive compensation payments and a larger discretionary pension contribution within working capital changes to inventories accounts receivable customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2019 was 3766 billion an increase of 110 billion from yearend 2018 debt related to financial products decreased 43 million debt related to met increased 115 billion in 2019 primarily due to the issuance of debt to finance a discretionary pension contribution which was partially offset by the impact of new accounting guidance on a previously failed saleleaseback transaction in japan on september 19 2019 we issued 10 billion of 3250 senior notes due 2049 and 500 million of 2600 senior notes due 2029 during 2019 we repurchased 405 billion of caterpillar common stock 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on management’s allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2019 was 275 billion information on our credit facility is as follows 

 

at december 31 2019 caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was 1463 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2019 cat financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 177 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2019 cat financial’s sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 765 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 746 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2019 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2019 were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2019 totaled 500 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s rates our debt as “lowa” while fitch and sp maintain a “mida” debt rating this split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health however a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable met’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios 

machinery energy  transportation 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 487 billion in 2019 compared with 635 billion in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2019 adjusted for noncash items which included lower accruals for shortterm compensation payments and a larger discretionary pension contribution partially offset by favorable changes in working capital within working capital changes to inventories accounts receivable customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable 

net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was 48 million compared with net cash used of 119 billion in 2018 the change was primarily due to decreased met lending with financial products during 2019 and the acquisitions of ecm spa and downer freight rail in 2018 

net cash used for financing activities during 2019 was 448 billion compared with net cash used of 547 billion in 2018 the change was primarily due to the issuance of 15 billion of longterm debt used to fund a discretionary pension contribution this was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of caterpillar common stock of 249 million and an increase in dividends paid of 181 million 

  

while our shortterm priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate our longterm cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating next we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments then we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases additional information on cash deployment is as follows 

  

strong financial position — our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity leverage cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies 

operational excellence and commitments — capital expenditures were 107 billion during 2019 compared to 122 billion in 2018 we expect met’s capital expenditures in 2020 to be about 12 billion we made 181 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2019 including a 15 billion discretionary us pension plan contribution by comparison we made 135 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in 2018 including a 10 billion discretionary contribution made to our us pension plans we expect to make approximately 280 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2020 

  

fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — we intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive longterm profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services including acquisitions 

as part of our new capital allocation strategy met free cash flow is a liquidity measure we will use going forward to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases we define met free cash flow as cash from met operations excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions less capital expenditures a goal of our new capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all met free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while maintaining our mida rating 

our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities in july 2018 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2018 authorization effective january 1 2019 with no expiration in 2019 we repurchased 405 billion of caterpillar common stock with 595 billion remaining under the 2018 authorization as of december 31 2019 caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2019 were approximately 550 million 

each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend dividends totaled 213 billion in 2019 representing 86 cents per share paid in each of the first and second quarters and 103 per share paid in each of the third and fourth quarters

financial products operating cash flow was 150 billion in 2019 compared with 152 billion in 2018 net cash used for investing activities was 414 million in 2019 compared with 278 billion in 2018 the change was primarily due to the impact of net intercompany purchased receivables and higher collections of finance receivables net cash used for financing activities in 2019 was 991 million compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 126 billion in 2018 the change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements and lower net intercompany borrowings partially offset by a lower dividend payment to met 

contractual obligations 

  

the company has committed cash outflow related to longterm debt operating lease agreements postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations interest on longterm debt and other longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  minimum payments for these obligations were

residual values for leased assets – the residual value of cat financial’s leased equipment is determined based on its estimated endofterm market value we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors including historical wholesale market sales prices past remarketing experience and any known significant marketproduct trends the following critical factors are also considered in our residual value estimates lease term market size and demand total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options 

upon termination of the lease the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price 

during the term of our leases we monitor residual values for operating leases adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2019 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 215 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 percent nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 80 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the company’s market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures the fair value determination is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test a goodwill impairment would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

warranty liability – at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels 

  

postretirement benefits – we sponsor defined benefit pension plans andor other postretirement benefit plans retirement healthcare and life insurance to employees in many of our locations throughout the world there are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate expected return on plan assets expected rate of compensation increase the future health care trend rate mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions the actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we utilize a marktomarket approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

 

discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense 

 

 

 





postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

the effects of a one percentagepoint change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2019 pension and opeb costs and obligations are as follows 

  

  



actuarial assumptions 



see note 12  “postemployment benefit plans” of part ii item 8 “financial statement and supplemental data” for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 17 billion and 15 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

credit loss reserve – the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management takes into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions 

accounts are identified for individual review based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees the allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by caterpillar sarl csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 23 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit as a result no amount related to these irs adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we give less weight in this analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes 

additional information related to income taxes is included in note 6  “income taxes” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

other matters 

  

environmental and legal matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required 

on january 27 2020 the brazilian federal environmental agency “ibama” issued caterpillar brasil ltda a notice of violation regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the piracicaba brazil facility we have instituted processes to address the allegations while we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with ibama the initial notice from ibama included a proposed fine of approximately 370000 we do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on january 7 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of illinois the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning us and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of nonus subsidiaries and the movement of cash among us and nonus subsidiaries the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain nonus caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures on march 23 2017 agents with the department of commerce the federal deposit insurance corporation and the internal revenue service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the company in the peoria illinois area including its former corporate headquarters the warrants identify and agents seized documents and information related to among other things the export of products from the united states the movement of products between the united states and switzerland the relationship between caterpillar inc and caterpillar sarl and sales outside the united states it is the company’s understanding that the warrants which concern both tax and export activities are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation the company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on march 20 2014 brazil’s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants including two subsidiaries of caterpillar inc mge  equipamentos e serviços ferroviários ltda mge and caterpillar brasil ltda the publication of the technical opinion opened cade’s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in brazil while companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in brazil criminal charges have been brought against one current employee of mge and two former employees of mge involving the same conduct alleged by cade on july 8 2019 cade found mge one of its current employees and two of its former employees liable for anticompetitive conduct cbl was dismissed from the proceeding without any finding of liability mge intends to appeal cades findings we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights taxes other than income taxes and securities laws the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

the table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and includes expected cost for 2020 



1 expected net periodic benefit cost benefit does not include an estimate for marktomarket gains or losses 



 the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses for 2019 2018 and 2017 are described below the net marktomarket losses were included in other income expense in the results of operations 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our us pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants as of december 31 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 290 million 

in the first quarter of 2017 we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of 20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits 

sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

met operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our met operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2020 cash flow for our met operations by approximately 225 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 250 million adverse impact on 2019 cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

in managing foreign currency risk for our financial products operations our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the swiss franc chinese yuan japanese yen indian rupee and australian dollar 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our met operations we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate contracts to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2020 pretax earnings of met last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate and duration of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within predetermined range on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2019 balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2020 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

the following definitions are provided for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i pension and opeb marktomarket losses resulting from plan remeasurements ii us tax reform impact iii restructuring costs in 2018 which were incurred to generate longerterm benefits and iv certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our periodoverperiod results in addition we provide a calculation of met free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments dividends and share repurchases 

reconciliations of adjusted operating profit margin to the most directly comparable gaap measure operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable gaap measure consolidated profit before taxes are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure profit per share  diluted are as follows 



reconciliations of met free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities are as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis the data has been grouped as follows

general 

  

originally organized as caterpillar tractor co in 1925 in the state of california our company was reorganized as caterpillar inc in 1986 in the state of delaware as used herein the term “caterpillar” “we” “us” “our” or “the company” refers to caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise 

  

overview 

  

with 2018  sales and revenues of 54722 billion  caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company principally operates through its three primary segments  construction industries resource industries and energy  transportation  and also provides financing and related services through its financial products segment caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

currently we have six operating segments of which four are reportable segments and are described below 

  

categories of business organization 

  

1     machinery energy  transportation  — represents the aggregate total of construction industries resource industries energy  transportation and all other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations 

  

2     financial products  — primarily includes the company’s financial products segment this category includes caterpillar financial services corporation cat financial caterpillar insurance holdings inc insurance services and their respective subsidiaries 

  

other information about our operations in 2018  including certain risks associated with our operations is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

  

the nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2018 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include case part of cnh industrial nv deere construction  forestry part of deere  company doosan infracore co ltd hitachi construction machinery co ltd hyundai construction equipment co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd kobelco construction machinery part of kobe steel ltd komatsu ltd kubota farm  industrial machinery part of kubota corporation and volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg group shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of the volvo group and shantui construction machinery co ltd part of shandong heavy industry group co each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools 

  



resource industries

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products however increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business we do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

order backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 165 billion at december 31 2018  and 158 billion at december 31 2017  compared with yearend 2017  the order backlog increased about 07 billion the increase was in energy  transportation and construction industries partially offset by a decrease in resource industries of the total backlog at december 31 2018  approximately 33 billion was not expected to be filled in 2019  

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 47 located in the united states and 121 located outside the united states serving 193 countries reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 177 countries the fg wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 80 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segments there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to these agreements the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item accrued expenses in statement 3 — consolidated financial position at december 31 of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “forecast” “target” “guide” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

macroeconomic risks 

our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products production challenges at suppliers a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs the increase in demand in 

2018 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints despite improvements in material flows parts and components constraints remain across some products which could impact our sales in 2019 as global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand on the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as decisions to reduce public spending or increase taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and global events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union commonly known as “brexit”   some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations such as the european unions general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 which carry in many cases significant potential penalties for noncompliance information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products while to date no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and we could in the future experience similar or more serious attacks while we actively manage information technology security risks within our control such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems networks and data further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through 

guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war terrorist acts or violence civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s 

long and shortterm ratings of caterpillar and cat financial are a3 and prime2 “lowa” while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mida” debt rating a downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates certain loans made by cat financial and financing extended to cat financial are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rates these consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to cat financial changes in market interest rates may influence cat financial’s financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding 

program there can be no assurance however that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations 

  

we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected we are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between us and nonus jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonus jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 6 — income taxes and note 22 — 

environmental and legal matters of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example certain cat financial activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry certain aspects of doddfrank remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the sec the cftc and federal banking regulators as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition changes in regulations or additional regulations in the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

tableend   

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under item 1a risk factors of the 2018 form 10k 

overview 

our sales and revenues for 2018 were 54722 billion a 20 percent increase from 2017 sales and revenues of 45462 billion the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume  mostly due to improved demand across all regions and across the three primary segments profit per share for 2018 was 1026 compared to profit per share of 126 in 2017 profit was 6147 billion in 2018 compared with 754 million in 2017 the increase was primarily due to lower tax expense higher sales volume decreased restructuring costs  and improved price realization  the increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and selling general and administrative sga and research and development rd expenses and lower profit from the financial products segment  

fourthquarter 2018 sales and revenues were 14342 billion up 1446 billion or 11 percent from 12896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 fourthquarter 2018 profit was 178 per share compared with a loss of 218 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 fourthquarter 2018 profit was 1048 billion compared with a loss of 1299 billion in 2017 

highlights for 2018 include 

 

 restructuring costs 

in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2018 we incurred 386 million of restructuring costs related to restructuring actions across the company during 2017 we incurred 1256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities restructuring costs should be lower in 2019 than 2018 

notes 



2018  compared with 2017   

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2017  at left and 2018  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues were 54722 billion in 2018 an increase of 9260 billion or 20 percent compared with 45462 billion in 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary segments including favorable changes in dealer inventories favorable price realization across the three primary segments also contributed to the sales improvement in addition sales were higher due to currency  impacts primarily from a stronger euro financial products’ revenues increased slightly 

sales increased in all regions with the largest sales increase in north america which improved 23 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand also contributing to higher sales was an increase in dealer inventories during 2018 compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017 

sales increased 13 percent in latin america  primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels 

eame sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher demand including favorable changes in dealer inventories the improvement in demand was primarily in europe the impact of a stronger euro and favorable price realization also contributed to higher sales the impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as dealer inventories increased more significantly in 2018 than in 2017 

asiapacific sales increased 28 percent primarily due to higher demand in several countries across the region including favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization dealer inventories increased during 2018 as compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017 

dealer machine and engine inventories increased about 23 billion in 2018 compared with an increase of about 100 million in 2017 dealers are independent and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 





consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2017  at left and 2018  at right items favorably impacting operating profit   appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments  and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit was 8293 billion in 2018 an increase of 3833 billion or 86 percent compared with 4460 billion in 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs higher manufacturing costs and increased sgard expenses were mostly offset by favorable price realization 

manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs partially offset by lower warranty expense material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices the impact of recently imposed tariffs on material costs was about 110 million during 2018 we expect higher expense in 2019 due to the fullyear impact of tariffs freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand 

sgard expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives 

restructuring costs were 394 million in 2018 related to restructuring actions across the company in 2017 we incurred 1227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually shortterm incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about 14 billion nearly the same as 2017 

for 2019 we expect shortterm incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2018 we also expect favorable price realization to about offset higher costs excluding shortterm incentive compensation expense 



other profitloss items 

 we have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of us tax reform legislation and included measurement period adjustments in 2018 of 104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of 2371 billion recognized in 2017 a 154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the writedown of us net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the us corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent this benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of 10 billion to us pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 us tax return a 50 million charge revised the provisionally estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of nonus earnings including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions 

the provision for income taxes in 2018 and 2017 also included noncash benefits of 63 million and 111 million respectively from reductions in the valuation allowance against us state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the united states an additional benefit of 25 million was included in 2018 due to the release of a valuation allowance for a certain nonus subsidiary the provision for income taxes in 2018 also included a charge of 59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years this error had the effect of overstating profit by 17 million and 33 million for 2017 and 2016 respectively management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented in addition a tax benefit of 56 million was recorded in 2018 compared with 64 million in 2017 for the settlement of stockbased compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative us gaap compensation expense 

we expect the annual effective tax rate will be higher in 2019 the anticipated increase primarily relates to the application of us tax reform provisions to earnings of nonus subsidiaries which do not have a calendar fiscal year end certain provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018 

construction industries 

construction industries’ total sales were 23237 billion in 2018 compared with 19240 billion in 2017 the increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment sales were also higher due to currency impacts primarily from a stronger euro 

 sales increased in all regions 

 construction industries’ profit was 4174 billion in 2018 compared with 3255 billion in 2017 the increase in profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable price realization partially offset by higher material and freight costs and increased sgard expenses partially due to spending for strategic growth initiatives 

construction industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 180 percent in 2018 compared with 169 percent in 2017 

resource industries 

resource industries’ total sales were 10270 billion in 2018 an increase of 2409 billion from 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment including aftermarket parts favorable commodity price levels and increased mining production contributed to higher mining equipment sales in addition increased sales to heavy construction quarry and aggregate customers were driven by positive global economic growth resource industries’ customers globally continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency of existing machine assets thereby extending equipment life cycles and lowering operating costs rebuild overhaul and maintenance activity was robust resulting in higher aftermarket parts sales favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement in 2019 we believe commodity market fundamentals will remain supportive for investment and mining companies will increase their capital expenditures we expect demand for heavy construction quarry and aggregate equipment will remain strong in 2019 

resource industries’ profit was 1603 billion in 2018 compared with 698 million in 2017 the improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency impacts manufacturing costs were unfavorable as lower warranty expense was more than offset by higher freight and material costs 

resource industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 156 percent in 2018 compared with 89 percent in 2017 

energy  transportation 



energy  transportation’s total sales were 22785 billion in 2018 compared with 19382 billion in 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications favorable price realization also contributed to the increase in sales 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 3938 billion in 2018 compared with 2856 billion in 2017 the improvement was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization this was partially offset due to increased spending for strategic growth initiatives and higher freight costs 

energy  transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 173 percent in 2018 compared with 147 percent in 2017 

financial products segment 

financial products’ segment revenues were 3279 billion an increase of 186 million or 6 percent from 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets  in north america and asiapacific these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in north america lower average earning assets in latin america and lower average financing rates in europe 

financial products’ segment profit was 505 million in 2018 compared with 792 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial an unfavorable impact from equity securities in insurance services and lower intercompany lending activity these unfavorable impacts which are not expected to recur in 2019 were partially offset by higher average earning assets and an increase in net yield on average earning assets

restructuring costs are a reconciling item between segment profit and consolidated profit before taxes 

the following table summarizes the 2017  and 2018  employee separation activity 



  

most of the remaining liability balance as of december 31 2018 is expected to be paid in 2019 

in march 2017 caterpillar informed belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal which led to the closure of the gosselies site impacting about 2000 employees production of caterpillar products at the gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017 the other operations and functions at the gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018 the program concluded in 2018 and we incurred a total of 647 million of restructuring costs primarily in 2017 under this program these costs were primarily related to employee separation costs longlived asset impairments and other costs which were partially offset by a lifo inventory decrement benefit 

restructuring costs for the year ended december 31 2016 were 1019 million throughout 2016 we initiated the following restructuring plans 

 

 

in september 2015 we announced a large scale restructuring plan the plan including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying us employees several voluntary separation programs outside of the us additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures that occurred through 2018 the largest action among those included in the plan was related to our european manufacturing footprint which led to the gosselies belgium facility closure as discussed above we incurred 121 million 817 million and 281 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively total restructuring costs incurred since the inception of the plan were 1788 million the remaining costs of approximately 50 million related to the plan are expected to be recognized in 2019 

although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities restructuring costs are anticipated to be lower in 2019 than 2018 we are expecting about 300 million of cost reduction in 2019 from lower operating costs primarily sga expenses and cost of goods sold primarily resulting from 2018 restructuring actions

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 69 billion held by our nonus subsidiaries as a result of us tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017 we expect to be able to use cash held by nonus subsidiaries in the united states in the future with minimal tax consequences 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2018 was 656 billion up from 571 billion in 2017 the increase was due to higher profit in 2018 adjusted for noncash items profit in 2017 included a noncash charge related to us tax reform legislation enacted in december 2017 the most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2018 this improvement was mostly offset by higher working capital requirements to support increasing production volumes and higher shortterm incentive compensation payments see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2018 was 3655 billion an increase of 168 billion from yearend 2017 debt related to financial products increased 160 billion primarily due to increased portfolio funding requirements debt related to met increased 79 million in 2018 during 2018 we repurchased 380 billion of caterpillar common stock 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on managements allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2018 was 275 billion information on our credit facility is as follows 

 

at december 31 2018 caterpillars consolidated net worth was 1407 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2018 cat financials covenant interest coverage ratio was 156 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2018 cat financials sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 769 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 833 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2018 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2018  were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2018  totaled 458 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody’s rates our debt as “lowa” while fitch and sp maintain a “mida” debt rating this split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health however a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable mets operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests warranty liability stockbased compensation reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments these assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets  – the residual values for cat financial’s leased assets which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors market size and demand any known significant marketproduct trends total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities past remarketing experience thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for noncompliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model changes and updates as well as market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure 

during the term of the equipment on operating leases we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2018 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 221 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 80 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired beginning in 2017 if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss prior to 2017 a twostep process was used for reporting units where we performed the twostep process the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the goodwill was not considered impaired if the carrying value was higher than the fair value there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill the difference was recognized as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the companys market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participants perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures the fair value determination is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test a goodwill impairment would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

warranty liability  – at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

stockbased compensation  – we use a latticebased optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights sars the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the latticebased optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following 

  

   

beginning in 2018 the fair value of restricted stock units rsus and performancebased restricted stock units prsus is determined as the closing stock price on the date of grant as holders of these awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of common stock prior to 2018 rsus and prsus were not credited dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividends were based on caterpillar’s quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant 

  

stockbased compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense stockbased compensation expense for prsus is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve  – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels 

  

postretirement benefits  – primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

 

discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense 

 

 

 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

see note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve  – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 1544 million and 1426 million as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

credit loss reserve  – the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management takes into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio 

adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions 

accounts are identified for individual review based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees the allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes  – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received on january 15 2019 the us treasury issued final regulations providing additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of nonus earnings we are currently evaluating the impact of these regulations and will recognize any resulting adjustments in the first quarter of 2019 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by caterpillar sarl csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 23 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit as a result no amount related to these irs adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we give less weight in this analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment 

about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes 

other matters 

  

environmental and legal matters 

the   company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required 

on january 7 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of illinois the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning us and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of nonus subsidiaries and the movement of cash among us and nonus subsidiaries the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain nonus caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures on march 23 2017 agents with the department of commerce the federal deposit insurance corporation and the internal revenue service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the company in the peoria illinois area including its former corporate headquarters the warrants identify and agents seized documents and information related to among other things the export of products from the united states the movement of products between the united states and switzerland the relationship between caterpillar inc and caterpillar sarl and sales outside the united states it is the company’s understanding that the warrants which concern both tax and export activities are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation the company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on march 20 2014 brazil’s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18  companies and over 100  individuals as defendants including two  subsidiaries of caterpillar inc mge  equipamentos e serviços ferroviários ltda mge and caterpillar brasil ltda the publication of the technical opinion opened cades official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in brazil while companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in brazil criminal charges have been brought against two  current employees of mge and one  former employee of mge involving the same conduct alleged by cade the company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights taxes other than income taxes and securities laws the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

we recognized expense of 415 million 342 million and 957 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans the increase in expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net marktomarket losses in 2018 compared to 2017 this was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and curtailment gains compared to curtailment and termination charges in 2017 the decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net marktomarket losses in 2017 compared to 2016 this was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits curtailment and termination charges and a lower expected return on plan assets 

the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses for 2018 2017 and 2016 are described below the net marktomarket losses were included in other income expense in the results of operations 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our us pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants as of december 31 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the society of actuaries for our us pension and opeb plans as of december 31 2016 this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 200 million 

in the first quarter of 2017 we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of 20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits 

we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of marktomarket gains and losses to increase approximately 260 million in 2019 this increase is primarily due to a lower expected return on plan assets us pension plans have an expected rate of return of 59 percent in 2019 compared to 63 percent in 2018 

in general our strategy for both the us and the nonus pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio for our us pension plans our yearend 2018 asset allocation was 70 percent fixed income 27 percent equities and 3 percent other our current us pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and 30 percent equities the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives the us plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis 

the yearend 2018 asset allocation for our nonus pension plans was 78 percent fixed income 13 percent equities 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other the 2018 weightedaverage target allocation for our nonus pension plans was also 78 percent fixed income 13 percent equities 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the nonus plans varies depending on the plan 

contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 14 billion and 16 billion in 2018 and 2017 respectively both years included a 10 billion discretionary contribution to our us pension plans we expect to make approximately 315 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2019 we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs the change in presentation was applied retrospectively to prior years for further information see note 1j  operations and summary of significant accounting policies  new accounting guidance of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and opeb expenses the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018 benefit costs and yearend obligations are included in the table below 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

the effects of a one percentagepoint change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018  pension and opeb costs and obligations are as follows 

  

  



sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

machinery energy  transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to 

five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy  transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2019  cash flow for our machinery energy  transportation operations by approximately 250 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 200 million adverse impact on 2018  cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

since our policy for financial products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the japanese yen british pound indian rupee swiss franc and australian dollar 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our machinery energy  transportation operations we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate contracts to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2019  pretax earnings of machinery energy  transportation last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating leases within certain parameters in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads regardless of the direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2018  balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2019 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018  pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

the following definitions are provided for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i restructuring costs which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits ii pension and opeb marktomarket losses resulting from plan remeasurements iii certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments iv us tax reform impact and v a gain on the sale of an equity investment we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and a means to assess our periodoverperiod results 

reconciliations of adjusted operating profit margin to the most directly comparable gaap measure operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable gaap measure consolidated profit before taxes are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure diluted profit per share are as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis the data has been grouped as follows 

  

consolidated – caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries 

  

machinery energy  transportation – caterpillar defines machinery energy  transportation as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries with financial products accounted for on the equity basis machinery energy  transportation information relates to the design manufacturing and marketing of our products financial products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment the 

nature of these businesses is different especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences we also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business 

  

financial products –  our finance and insurance subsidiaries primarily cat financial and insurance services 

  

consolidating adjustments – eliminations of transactions between machinery energy  transportation and financial products

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

  

nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2017 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh industrial nv deere  company hitachi construction machinery co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd doosan infracore co ltd hyundai construction equipment co ltd and kubota farm  industrial machinery part of kubota corporation as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg group shantui construction machinery co ltd part of shandong heavy industry group co and shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining quarry waste and material handling applications caterpillar offers a broad product range and services to deliver comprehensive solutions for our mining customers we manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world our equipment is used to extract and haul copper iron ore coal oil sands aggregates gold and other minerals and ores in addition to equipment resource industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities 

customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment in some developing markets customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions we believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality most productive products in the industry 

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products applications and regional markets our global surface competitors include komatsu ltd hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment atlas copco ab deere  company sandvik ab and liebherrinternational ag our global underground competitors include atlas copco ab liebherrinternational ag sandvik ab komatsu ltd and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine oil and gas industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc rollsroyce power systems ge power siemens power and gas deutz ag and wärtsilä corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se baker hughes a ge company rollsroyce marine mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co inc aggreko plc and others are primarily packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens akteingesellschaft alstom transport sa and voestalpine ag we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm trade receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activity is conducted in north america with additional offices and subsidiaries in latin america asiapacific europe africa and middle east 

  

for over 35 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 56 percent include 

  

 



 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 14 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 30 percent include 

  

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2017 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio this matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data see also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in item 1 a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience customer financial information creditrating agency ratings loantovalue ratios and other internal metrics cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the 

dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products however increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business we do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents

the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 158 billion at december 31 2017  and 121 billion at december 31 2016  compared with yearend 2016  the order backlog increased about 37 billion the increase was across all segments most significantly in resource industries and construction industries of the total backlog at december 31 2017  approximately 29 billion was not expected to be filled in 2018  

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 48 located in the united states and 123 located outside the united states serving 192 countries reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 93 distributors covering 182 countries the fg wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited are sold through its worldwide network of 154 distributors covering 131 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 80 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segments there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

macroeconomic risks 

our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs the increase in demand in 2017 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017 parts and components constraints remain across some products which could impact our growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand on the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union commonly known as “brexit”   some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

 



 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and we could in the future experience similar attacks however to date no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition 

results of operations or liquidity while we actively manage information technology security risks within our control there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems networks and data the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions 

in response to economic and business conditions we have taken significant restructuring and cost reduction actions in recent years we expect to take additional restructuring actions as we continue to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation which may reduce our profitability in the periods incurred as a result of these actions we will incur charges which may include but not be limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits potential additional pension funding obligations and pension curtailments any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives 

we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow which we expect to have a positive longterm effect on our business competitive position results of operations and financial condition for example one such initiative is to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and ordertodelivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements as well as to reduce waste further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers there can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if these initiatives are not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war terrorist acts or violence fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our 

products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings on december 13 2016 moody’s investors service moody’s downgraded the long and shortterm ratings of caterpillar and cat financial to a3 from a2 and to prime2 from prime1 a further downgrade of caterpillar or cat financial’s credit ratings by moody’s or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations 

  

we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements we are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil 

sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonus jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 5 — income taxes and note 22 — environmental and legal matters of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example certain cat financial activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition additional regulations in the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the company’s business under item 1a risk factors of the 2017 form 10k 

overview 

our sales and revenues for 2017 were 45462 billion an 18 percent increase from 2016 sales and revenues of 38537 billion the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume  mostly due to improved enduser demand in addition favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume the improvement in enduser demand was across all regions and most end markets the favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016 compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017 favorable price realization  mostly in  construction industries  also contributed to the sales improvement profit per share for 2017 was 126 compared to a loss per share of 011 in 2016 profit was 754 million in 2017 compared to a loss of 67 million in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume improved price realization a decrease in marktomarket losses  related to pension and other postemployment benefits opeb  plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in  resource industries  in 2016 offset by higher taxes primarily due to enactment of us tax reform legislation on december 22 2017 an increase in period costs  and restructuring costs  was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs  

fourthquarter 2017 sales and revenues were 12896 billion up 3322 billion or 35 percent from 9574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 fourthquarter 2017 loss was 218 per share compared with a loss of 200 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 fourthquarter 2017 loss was 1299 billion compared with a loss of 1171 billion in 2016 

highlights for 2017 include 

 

 restructuring costs 

in recent years we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure during 2017 we incurred 1256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company during 2016 we incurred 1019 billion of restructuring costs primarily related to resource industries and energy  transportation  in 2018 we expect restructuring actions to continue and anticipate costs of about 400 million 

notes 



2017  compared with 2016   

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2016  at left and 2017  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues were 45462 billion in 2017 an increase of 6925 billion or 18 percent compared with 38537 billion in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume mostly due to improved enduser demand which we expect to continue in 2018 in addition favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume the improvement in enduser demand was across all regions and most end markets the favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016 compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017 dealer machine and engine inventories increased about 100 million in 2017 compared to a decrease of about 16 billion during 2016 dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 

by segment the largest sales volume increase was in construction industries mostly due to higher enduser demand for construction equipment resource industries sales volume increased due to higher enduser demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and a favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories energy  transportation’s sales volume was higher mostly due to increased demand for equipment and aftermarket parts for oil and gas and industrial applications favorable price realization mostly in construction industries also contributed to the sales improvement financial products’ revenues were about flat 

sales increased in all regions in north america sales increased 19 percent primarily due to higher enduser demand mostly for onshore oil and gas applications and construction equipment the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization primarily in construction industries asiapacific sales increased 23 percent primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales mostly in china resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment eame  sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher enduser demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in resource industries and favorable changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories in 2016 and inventories were about flat in 2017 in addition price realization was favorable primarily in construction industries sales increased 25 percent in latin america primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved enduser demand from low levels and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017 

the increase in demand in 2017 led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017 parts and components constraints remain across some products which could impact the company’s growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand 

consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2016  at left and 2017  at right items favorably impacting operating profit   appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments  and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit for 2017 was 4406 billion compared with 498 million in 2016 the increase of 3908 billion was primarily due to higher sales volume improved price realization a decrease in marktomarket losses related to pension and opeb plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries in 2016 an increase in period costs and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs 

period costs increased primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year these actions primarily impacted depreciation expense and research and development rd expenses 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually shortterm incentive compensation expense was about 14 billion in 2017 significantly above targeted levels compared to about 250 million in 2016 for 2018 we expect shortterm incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2017 

in 2017 we incurred 1256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company in 2016 restructuring costs were 1019 billion primarily related to resource industries and energy  transportation 

variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017 and decreased in 2016 material costs were slightly unfavorable in 2017 as higher steel costs were partially offset by cost reduction actions we expect material costs to be higher in 2018 primarily due to anticipated increases in commodity prices 

other profitloss items 



adjusted profit before tax excluding a discrete benefit from stockbased compensation awards was 27 percent compared to 26 percent in 2016 

the provision for income taxes for 2017 also includes a charge of 2371 billion due to the enactment of us tax reform legislation on december 22 2017 the provisionally estimated charge includes a 596 million writedown of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the us corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of nonus earnings we believe this charge is a reasonable estimate as of january 18 2018 that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed interpretations and assumptions are refined additional guidance is issued and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation the 2017 provision for income taxes also includes the following 

 the provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a noncash charge of 141 million net of us federal tax at 35 percent for increases in the valuation allowance against us state deferred tax assets 

we expect the annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of us tax reform

construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 19133 billion in 2017 compared with 15612 billion in 2016 the increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization 

 sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in asiapacific and north america 



 construction industries’ profit was 3258 billion in 2017 compared with 1650 billion in 2016 the increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization period costs were unfavorable primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense partially offset by lower depreciation expense 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 7504 billion in 2017 an increase of 1778 billion or 31 percent from 2016 sales increased due to higher enduser demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies after a number of years of low investment miners have begun to increase capital expenditures reflecting more confidence in their end markets idle mining trucks on customer sites also decreased in 2017 these changes resulted in higher sales for aftermarket parts to support increased mining activity as well as maintenance and rebuild activities and by the second half of 2017 resulted in higher enduser demand for mining equipment dealer inventories increased in 2017 compared with a significant decrease in 2016 

resource industries’ profit was 690 million in 2017 compared with a loss of 1047 billion in 2016 the improvement was partially due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million in 2016 higher sales volume lower variable manufacturing costs favorable price realization and lower period costs also contributed to increased profit variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017 to support higher production volumes and decreased in 2016 period costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions partially offset by an increase in shortterm incentive compensation expense 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 15964 billion in 2017 compared with 14411 billion in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales in oil and gas and industrial applications 

 sales into oil and gas applications are expected to increase in 2018 led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing in north america we expect an increase in transportation primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services 

energy  transportation’s profit was 2883 billion in 2017 compared with 2222 billion in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower variable manufacturing costs partially offset by higher period costs variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material costs cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017 compared to a decrease in 2016 the increase in period costs was primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense 

financial products segment 

financial products’ segment revenues were 3093 billion an increase of 100 million or 3 percent from 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in north america a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in north america and higher average earning assets  in eame these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in asiapacific and lower average earning assets in north america and latin america 

financial products’ segment profit was 792 million in 2017 compared with 702 million in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at insurance services an increase in net yield on average earning assets and increased intercompany lending activity these favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in sga expenses due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense 

at the end of 2017 past dues at cat financial were 278 percent compared with 238 percent at the end of 2016 writeoffs net of recoveries were 114 million for the full year of 2017 compared with 123 million for the full year of 2016

total sales and revenues were 12896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 3322 billion or 35 percent compared with 9574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume mostly due to improved enduser demand in addition favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume the improvement in enduser demand was across all regions and most end markets the favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017 dealer machine and engine inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a decrease of about 800 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 

by segment the largest sales volume increase was in construction industries mostly due to higher enduser demand for construction equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories energy  transportation’s sales volume increased due to higher demand across all applications sales volume for resource industries increased due to higher enduser demand for equipment and aftermarket parts favorable price realization primarily in construction industries and resource industries also contributed to the sales improvement financial products’ revenues were about flat 

sales increased across all regions with the largest increase in north america sales improved 46 percent in north america primarily due to higher enduser demand for both equipment and aftermarket parts changes in dealer inventories were favorable as dealer inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 eame sales increased 38 percent primarily due to higher enduser demand for equipment and favorable price realization asiapacific sales increased 22 percent primarily due to higher enduser demand for construction equipment about half of the sales improvement in asiapacific was in china resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment sales increased 39 percent in latin america due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved enduser demand from low levels as well as favorable changes in dealer inventories 

consolidated operating profit loss

operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1161 billion compared with a loss of 1262 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase of 2423 billion was due to higher sales volume a decrease in marktomarket losses related to pension and opeb plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries in 2016 favorable price realization lower variable manufacturing costs and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher period costs price realization was favorable primarily in construction industries and resource industries 

variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense cost absorption was favorable as inventory was about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a reduction in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2016 material costs were slightly unfavorable due to increases in steel prices period costs were higher primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense also contributing to increased period costs were targeted investments and higher manufacturing costs to support higher production volumes partially offset by lower depreciation expense 

restructuring costs were 245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 

shortterm incentive compensation expense was about 350 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to about 50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016

 construction industries’ profit was 838 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume favorable price realization and variable manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by unfavorable period costs and higher material costs primarily for steel the increase in period costs was due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense targeted investments and higher manufacturing period costs to support increased production volumes 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 2205 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 762 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher enduser demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in all regions favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization dealer deliveries for new equipment increased significantly positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies after several years of low investment miners began to increase capital expenditures reflecting more confidence in their end markets dealer inventories increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 

resource industries’ profit was 209 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a loss of 711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the improvement was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 higher sales volume and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 4706 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 3849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 881 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume partially offset by higher period costs the increase in period costs was primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation expense costs associated with higher production and targeted investments 

financial products segment 

financial products’ segment revenues were 783 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 41 million or 6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in north america higher average earning assets in eame and asiapacific and a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in north america these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in asiapacific 

financial products’ segment profit was 233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at insurance services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 898 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 a decrease of 683 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 corporate items and eliminations include restructuring costs corporatelevel expenses timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost 

currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology and intersegment eliminations 

the decrease in expense was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower marktomarket losses related to pension and opeb plans and lower restructuring costs partially offset by methodology differences and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense marktomarket losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 301 million compared to marktomarket losses of 985 million in the fourth quarter of 2016

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2015  at left and 2016  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

  

total sales and revenues were 38537 billion in 2016 compared with 47011 billion in 2015 a decline of 8474 billion or 18 percent the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined most of the decrease was for new equipment the unfavorable impact of price realization primarily in construction industries also contributed to the decline 

sales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as inventories decreased about 16 billion in 2016 compared with a decrease of about 10 billion in 2015 the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories was primarily in north america dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers we believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution centers 

sales declined in all regions in north america sales decreased 19 percent due to lower enduser demand primarily driven by construction industries and energy  transportation and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories primarily in construction industries in eame sales declined 22 percent primarily in africamiddle east due to weak economic conditions resulting from low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment sales decreased 29 percent in latin america primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region the most significant decreases were in mexico and brazil asiapacific sales declined 9 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for energy  transportation applications and products used in mining partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment mostly in china 

energy  transportation’s sales declined 22 percent largely due to lower enduser demand for oil and gas and transportation applications construction industries’ sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories resource industries’ sales declined 26 percent mostly due to continued low enduser demand financial products’ segment revenues were about flat 

  

consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2015  at left and 2016  at right items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses 

  

operating profit for 2016 was 498 million compared with 3785 billion in 2015 the decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume including an unfavorable mix of products the decrease in profit also included an unfavorable impact from marktomarket losses related to remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans and a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries in addition price realization financial products and restructuring costs were unfavorable these items were partially offset by favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs 

the unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions primarily in construction industries we saw competitive pressure during 2016 that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity unfavorable currency pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited competitors based outside the united states and an overall weak economic environment 

period costs were lower primarily due to the impact from substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense the reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing costs and selling general and administrative expenses sga variable manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and the favorable impact of cost absorption cost absorption was favorable due to inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 than in 2016 

restructuring costs of 1019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple restructuring actions across the company primarily in resource industries and energy  transportation in 2015 restructuring costs were 898 million 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually expense in 2016 was about 250 million as compared to about 585 million in 2015 

other profitloss items 

other incomeexpense in 2016 was income of 146 million compared with income of 161 million in 2015 the unfavorable change was primarily due to the absence of a gain of 120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former thirdparty logistics business this was mostly offset by a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than the net losses in 2015 

the provision for income taxes for 2016 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 364 percent compared to 255 percent for 2015 excluding the items discussed in the paragraph below the increase was primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the surface mining  technology  goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting a favorable 

geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective the effective tax rate related to 2016 fullyear adjusted profit before tax was 26 percent 

the provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a 141 million noncash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax assets due to recent us gaap losses that were expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance the provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a 42 million net charge to adjust prior years’ us taxes 

segment information 



 





construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 15612 billion in 2016 a decrease of 2185 billion or 12 percent from 2015 the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization while sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts most of the decrease was for new equipment 

 sales decreased in north america eame and latin america and were higher in asiapacific 



 construction industries’ profit was 1650 billion in 2016 compared with 1865 billion in 2015 the decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions the decline was partially offset by favorable costs primarily due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions improved material costs the favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in 2015 the impact of cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 5726 billion in 2016 a decrease of 2013 billion or 26 percent from 2015 the decline was almost entirely due to lower sales volume sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts however most of the decrease was for new equipment aftermarket parts sales increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of 2016 

the sales decrease was primarily due to lower enduser demand across all regions while most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier current prices were not sufficient to drive an increase in shortterm demand for new equipment we believe idle mining trucks on customer sites also had a negative impact on enduser demand in 2016 mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they had for several years 

resource industries incurred a loss of 1047 billion in 2016 compared with profit of 1 million in 2015 the most significant item impacting 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million related to the surface mining  technology reporting unit excluding the impairment charge the remaining unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization these items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions improved material costs and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 14411 billion in 2016 a decrease of 4108 billion or 22 percent from 2015 the decrease was almost entirely the result of lower sales volume sales decreased in all applications with oil and gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the energy  transportation decline 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 2222 billion in 2016 compared with 3390 billion in 2015 the decline was due to a decrease in sales volume including an unfavorable mix of products this was partially offset by lower costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions favorable material costs and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense 

financial products segment 

financial products’ revenues were 2993 billion a decrease of 85 million or 3 percent from 2015 the decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in asiapacific and latin america an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment primarily in north america and lower average financing rates in latin america these decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in north america 

financial products’ profit was 702 million in 2016 compared with 809 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in sga expenses 

at the end of 2016 past dues at cat financial were 238 percent compared with 214 percent at the end of 2015 the increase in past dues was primarily driven by the european marine portfolio writeoffs net of recoveries were 123 million for the fullyear 2016 compared with 155 million for the fullyear 2015 

as of december 31 2016 cat financials allowance for credit losses totaled 343 million or 129 percent of net finance receivables compared with 338 million or 122 percent of net finance receivables at yearend 2015 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 2712 billion in 2016 which was an increase of 766 million compared with 2015 corporate items and eliminations include corporatelevel expenses restructuring costs timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology and intersegment eliminations 

the most significant item was the unfavorable impact of marktomarket losses related to remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket losses in 2016 were 985 million compared to marktomarket losses of 179 million in 2015 the remaining decrease in expense of 40 million was primarily due to a favorable impact from methodology differences partially offset by a 121 million increase in restructuring costs 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs for 2017 2016 and 2015 were as follows 



in 2017 about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in gosselies belgium within construction industries and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company the restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in resource industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry in addition costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of onhighway vocational trucks within energy  transportation and other restructuring actions across the company the restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company 

restructuring costs are a reconciling item between segment profit and consolidated profit before taxes 

the following table summarizes the 2016  and 2017  employee separation activity 



  

most of the remaining liability balance as of december 31 2017 is expected to be paid in 2018 and primarily includes employee separation payments related to closure of the gosselies belgium facility 

in march 2017 caterpillar informed belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal which will lead to the closure of the gosselies site impacting about 2000 employees production of caterpillar products at the gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017 the other operations and functions at the gosselies site are expected to be gradually phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018 we estimate restructuring costs incurred under this program to be about 675 million in 2017 we recognized 653 million of restructuring costs which included 436 million of employee separation costs 205 million for longlived asset impairments and 77 million of other costs partially offset by a 65 million lifo inventory decrement benefit the remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2018 

restructuring costs for the year ended december 31 2016 were 1019 million throughout 2016 we initiated the following restructuring plans 

 

 

in september 2015 we announced a large scale restructuring plan the plan including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying us employees several voluntary separation programs outside of the us additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures expected to occur through 2018 the largest action among those included in the plan was related to our european manufacturing footprint which led to the gosselies belgium facility closure as discussed above we incurred 817 million 281 million and 569 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively for a total of 1667 million we expect to recognize approximately 200 million of additional restructuring costs related to the plan in 2018 

  

in 2018 we expect to incur about 400 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure we are expecting about 250 million of cost reduction in 2018 from lower operating costs primarily sga expenses and cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring actions

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our met operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio during 2017 we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our met and financial products operations on a consolidated basis we ended 2017 with 826 billion of cash an increase of 109 billion from yearend 2016 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 75 billion held by our nonus subsidiaries us tax reform legislation enacted on december 22 2017 resulted in a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of nonus earnings the resulting us tax liability net of available foreign tax credits will be payable over eight years and is not expected to significantly impact liquidity as a result of this legislation we expect to be able to use cash held by nonus subsidiaries in the united states in the future with minimal us tax consequences 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2017 was 570 billion up slightly from 564 billion in 2016 the increase was due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for noncash items including a charge related to the enactment of us tax reform legislation and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense accruals the most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017 this improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017 within working capital changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable these changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016 in addition the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower shortterm incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2017 was 3488 billion a decrease of 191 billion from yearend 2016 debt related to financial products decreased 689 million debt related to met decreased 122 billion in 2017 primarily due to the early redemption of a long term debt issuance on october 10 2017 we called for redemption of all 900 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 790 senior notes due in december 2018 payable in cash the redemption date occurred on november 10 2017 and included a prepayment fee of 58 million 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on managements allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2017 was 275 billion our three credit facilities are 

 

at december 31 2017 caterpillars consolidated net worth was 1372 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2017 cat financials covenant interest coverage ratio was 188 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2017 cat financials sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 738 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 771 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2017 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2017  were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2017  totaled 459 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major rating agencies in december 2016 moodys investors service downgraded our longterm ratings to a3 from a2 and shortterm ratings to prime2 from prime1 the moodys downgrade did not have a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health a further downgrade of our credit ratings by moodys or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult however our longterm ratings with fitch and sp continue to be mida in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable our met operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios

net cash provided by operating activities was 546 billion in 2017 compared with 389 billion in 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for noncash items including a charge related to the enactment of us tax reform legislation and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense the most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017 this improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017 within working capital changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable these changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016 in addition the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower shortterm incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow 

net cash used for investing activities in 2017 was 760 million compared with net cash used of 178 billion in 2016 the change was primarily due to met lending activity with financial products that occurred in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017 

net cash used for financing activities during 2017 was 258 billion compared with 216 billion in the same period of 2016 the change was primarily due to higher payments on debt in 2017 including the early retirement of 900 million of debt due in december 2018 partially offset by proceeds from common stock issued from stock options exercised in 2017 

  

our priorities for cash deployment have not changed while our shortterm priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate our longterm cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mida rating next we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments then we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases additional information on cash deployment is as follows 

  

strong financial position   —  a key measure of mets financial strength used by management is mets debttocapital ratio debttocapital is defined as shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year and longterm debt due after one year debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity debt also includes mets longterm borrowings from financial products the debttocapital ratio for met was 367 percent at december 31 2017 within our target range of 30 to 45 percent mets debttocapital ratio was 410 percent at december 31 2016 the decrease in the debttocapital ratio was primarily driven by a decrease in debt which included an early retirement of 900 million of debt due in december 2018 

operational requirements and commitments   —  capital expenditures were 916 million during 2017 compared to 121 billion for the same period in 2016 we expect mets capital expenditures in 2018 to be between 10 and 15 billion contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 161 billion and 329 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively we expect to make approximately 365 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2018 we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans 

  

return capital to shareholders   —  dividends totaled 183 billion in 2017 representing 77 cents per share paid in the first and second quarters and 78 cents per share paid in the third and fourth quarters each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend in january 2014 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2014 authorization which will expire on december 31 2018 we did not purchase any caterpillar common stock in 2017 as of december 31 2017 547 billion remained available under the 2014 authorization caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2017 were approximately 598 million 

  

financial products 

  

financial products operating cash flow was 135 billion in 2017 compared with 155 billion in 2016 net cash used for investing activities was 591 million in 2017 compared with cash provided by investing activities of 299 million in 2016 the change was primarily due to the impact of net intercompany purchased receivables partially offset by lower capital expenditures for equipment on operating leases net cash used for financing activities in 2017 was 182 billion compared with 107 billion in 2016 the change was primarily due to the impact of borrowings with met 



contractual obligations 

  

the company has committed cash outflow related to longterm debt operating lease agreements postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations interest on longterm debt and other longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  minimum payments for these obligations were 

  



  

 

the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits was 1286 million at december 31 2017 payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements these obligations are not included in the table above we do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are a party to certain offbalance sheet arrangements primarily in the form of guarantees information related to guarantees appears in note 21 – “guarantees and product warranty” of part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests impairment of availableforsale securities warranty liability stockbased compensation 

reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments these assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets  – the residual values for cat financial’s leased assets which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors market size and demand any known significant marketproduct trends total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities past remarketing experience thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for noncompliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model changes and updates as well as market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure 

during the term of the equipment on operating leases we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2017 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 220 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 80 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired beginning in 2017 if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss prior to 2017 a twostep process was used for reporting units where we performed the twostep process the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value the goodwill was not considered impaired if the carrying value was higher than the fair value there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill the difference was recognized as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the companys market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior 

management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participants perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures the fair value determination is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test a goodwill impairment would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

impairment of availableforsale securities  –   availableforsale securities primarily at insurance services are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value 

  

for debt securities once a security’s fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred these reviews which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed otherthantemporarily impaired at any time once a security’s fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months the security will be otherthantemporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise 

  

for equity securities in a loss position determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired requires an analysis of that securitys historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return this information is utilized to estimate a security’s future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates 

for both debt and equity securities qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired these include reviews of the following significant changes in the regulatory economic or technological environment of the investee significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

  

warranty liability  – at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

stockbased compensation  – we use a latticebased optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights sars the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the latticebased optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following 

  



   

the fair value of our rsus and prsus is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividends are based on caterpillar’s quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant a decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense 

  

stockbased compensation expense recognized based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense stockbased compensation expense for prsus is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve  – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels 

  

postretirement benefits  – primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

 

discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense 

 

 

 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

see note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve  – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 1426 million and 1288 million as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

credit loss reserve  – the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management takes into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions 

accounts are identified for individual review based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees the allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes  – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities 

income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation that statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate in part due to profits of nonus subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which were generally lower than the us rate of 35 percent effective prior to january 1 2018 caterpillar sarl csarl primarily taxable locally in switzerland contributes the most significant amount of this difference for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the 

united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 23 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit as a result no amount related to these irs adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law on december 22 2017 us tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the us taxation of nonus earnings we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of us tax reform however we have made a reasonable estimate of the 2017 financial statement impact as of january 18 2018 and recognized a provisional charge of 2371 billion we will continue to update our calculations as additional required information is prepared and analyzed interpretations and assumptions are refined additional guidance is issued and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation these updates could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances 

the provisionally estimated charge includes a 596 million writedown of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the us corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning january 1 2018 we are still analyzing certain aspects of the law and refining our calculations of basis differences as of december 31 2017 which could affect the measurement of these balances 

the provisionally estimated charge includes 1775 billion for the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of nonus earnings including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions the us federal tax cost for the mandatory deemed repatriation is computed at 155 percent for nonus earnings held in liquid assets and 8 percent for nonliquid assets reduced by applicable foreign tax credits these estimates are provisional due to additional information and analysis required to determine cumulative taxable earnings since 1986 for nonus subsidiaries at two separate points in time and to determine the amount of earnings that are held in liquid versus nonliquid assets as defined in the new legislation at several different measurement periods in addition information is being gathered and analyzed to support available foreign tax credits including estimates of credit utilization and valuation allowance considerations for any remaining foreign tax credit carryforward due to uncertainty about aspects of the tax law we have made various assumptions to determine our reasonable estimate that we expect to refine as additional guidance is issued 

as a result of us tax reform legislation distributions of profits from nonus subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant us tax impact in the future however these distributions may be subject to nonus withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions we have recorded a deferred tax liability of 138 million for withholding taxes in nonus jurisdictions where earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested additional information and analysis are needed to determine the final amount of deferred tax liability considering factors such as whether nonus entities are subject to withholding taxes have reserve requirements or have projected working capital and other capital needs in the country where the earnings were generated that would result in a decision to indefinitely reinvest a portion or all their earnings 

deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for 2016 included an increase in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax assets resulting in a 141 million noncash charge net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent the primary driver of the increase was recent us gaap losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance due to better than previously forecasted 2017 us gaap results in certain us state jurisdictions the provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a decrease in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax assets resulting in a 111 million noncash benefit net of federal deferred tax adjustment of 35 percent we give less weight in this analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends 

other matters 

  

environmental and legal matters 

the   company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required 

on january 7 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of illinois the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning us and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of nonus subsidiaries and the movement of cash among us and nonus subsidiaries the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain nonus caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures on march 23 2017 agents with the department of commerce the federal deposit insurance corporation and the internal revenue service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the company in the peoria illinois area including its former corporate headquarters the warrants identify and agents seized documents and information related to among other things the export of products from the united states the movement of products between the united states and switzerland the relationship between caterpillar inc and caterpillar sarl and sales outside the united states it is the company’s understanding that the warrants which concern both tax and export activities are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation the company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on march 20 2014 brazil’s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18  companies and over 100  individuals as defendants including two  subsidiaries of caterpillar inc mge  equipamentos e serviços ferroviários ltda mge and caterpillar brasil ltda the publication of the technical opinion opened cades official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in brazil while companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in brazil criminal charges have been brought against two  current employees of mge and one  former employee of mge involving the same conduct alleged by cade the company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on october 24 2013 progress rail received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of california related to the former railcar repair operations of its subsidiary united industries llc united at the intermodal rail yard at terminal island california terminal island united complied with the subpoena and cooperated with the us attorney after investigation the us attorney alleged that united engaged in unnecessary and improper railcar repair activities and disposed of railcar parts by hand in the water surrounding its former terminal island operation on december 7 2017 united entered a guilty plea in us district court for the central district of california to a single misdemeanor violation of the refuse act as part of the agreement to enter the plea united has paid 25 million in fines and restitution 

in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax and securities laws the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these 

unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

we recognized expense of 342 million in 2017 957 million in 2016 and 292 million in 2015 related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans the decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net marktomarket losses in 2017 compared to 2016 this was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits curtailment and termination charges in 2017 related to the gosselies belgium and aurora illinois facility closures and a lower expected return on plan assets the increase in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher net marktomarket loss in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower expected return on plan assets as a result of a lower asset base in 2016 compared to 2015 and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets this was partially offset by lower interest costs primarily due to adoption of a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost discussed below and lower service costs primarily due to fewer employees earning benefits under our plans as a result of the us voluntary retirement enhancement program that was implemented in the fourth quarter 2015 

the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses for 2017 2016 and 2015 are described below 

 

the net marktomarket losses were in the following results of operations line items 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to the presentation of net periodic pension and opeb costs this guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period the other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations as a result components of pension and opeb costs other than service costs will be reclassified from operating costs to other incomeexpense this change will be applied retrospectively to prior years 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our us pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants as of december 31 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the soa for our us pension and opeb plans as of december 31 2016 this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 200 million 

in the first quarter of 2017 we announced the closure of our gosselies belgium facility this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits in march 2017 we recognized a net loss of 20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits in addition we announced the decision to phase out production at our aurora illinois facility which resulted in termination benefits of 9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our us hourly defined benefit pension plan 

beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by 140 million and 180 million respectively under the new method than they would have been under the previous method this change had no impact on our yearend defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain reported for the respective year 

we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of marktomarket gains and losses to decrease approximately 80 million in 2018 this decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018 

in general our strategy for both the us and the nonus pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio for our us pension plans our yearend 2017 asset allocation was 34 percent equities 62 percent fixed income and 4 percent other our current us pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives the us plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis 

the yearend 2017 asset allocation for our nonus pension plans was 40 percent equities 53 percent fixed income 4 percent real estate and 3 percent other the 2017 weightedaverage target allocations for our nonus pension plans was 38 percent equities 54 percent fixed income 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the nonus plans varies depending on the plan 

contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 16 billion and 329 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively the 2017 contributions include a 10 billion discretionary contribution made to our us pension plans in december 2017 we expect to make approximately 365 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2018 we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans 

actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and opeb expenses the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2017 benefit costs and yearend obligations are included in the table below 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

following are the effects of a one percentagepoint change in our primary pension and opeb actuarial assumptions included in the following table on 2017  pension and other opeb costs and obligations 

  

  



sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

machinery energy  transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy  transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2018  cash flow for our machinery energy  transportation operations by approximately 193 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a 

potential 143 million adverse impact on 2017  cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

since our policy for financial products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the japanese yen british pound indian rupee euro and australian dollar 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our machinery energy  transportation operations we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2018  pretax earnings of machinery energy  transportation last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2017 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating leases within certain parameters in connection with that policy we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads regardless of the direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2017  balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential 5 million adverse impact on 2018 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 6 million adverse impact to 2017  pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

the following definitions are provided for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i restructuring costs which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits ii pension and opeb marktomarket losses resulting from plan remeasurements iii state deferred tax valuation allowance reversal iv a gain on the sale of an equity investment v us tax reform impact and vi goodwill impairment charges we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and a means to assess our periodoverperiod results 

reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable gaap measure consolidated profit loss before taxes are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure diluted profit per share are as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis the data has been grouped as follows 

  

consolidated – caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries 

  

machinery energy  transportation – caterpillar defines machinery energy  transportation as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries with financial products accounted for on the equity basis machinery energy  transportation information relates to the design manufacturing and marketing of our products financial products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment the nature of these businesses is different especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences we also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business

other information about our operations in 2016  including certain risks associated with our operations is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

  

nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2016 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh industrial nv deere  company hitachi construction machinery co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai construction equipment part of hyundai heavy industries as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xiamen xgma machinery co ltd xcmg group the shandong heavy industry group co ltd shantui construction machinery co ltd strong construction machinery co ltd and shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd sdlg part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining quarry waste and material handling applications caterpillar offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry we manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world our equipment is used to extract and haul copper iron ore coal oil sands aggregates gold and other minerals and ores in addition to equipment resource industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities 

customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment in some developing markets customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions we believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality most productive products in the industry 

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products applications and regional markets our global surface competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment atlas copco ab and sandvik mining our global underground competitors include joy global inc atlas copco ab liebherrinternational ag sandvik mining and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd 

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



  

energy  transportation 

  

our energy  transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas power generation marine rail and industrial applications including cat® machines the product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines generator sets marine propulsion systems gas turbines and turbinerelated services the remanufacturing of cat engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies dieselelectric locomotives and other railrelated products and services and product support of onhighway vocational trucks for north america 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine oil and gas industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc rollsroyce power systems ge oil  gas ge power deutz ag and wärtsilä corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se siemens energy rollsroyce marine mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co inc aggreko plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens akteingesellschaft alstom transport sa and voestalpine ag we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions 

the energy  transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts 

 

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm trade receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america cat financial also has offices and subsidiaries in asiapacific europe and latin america 

  

for over 35 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 55 percent include 

  

 



 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 12 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 33 percent include 

  

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2016 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio this matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data see also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in item 1 a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience customer financial information creditrating agency ratings loantovalue ratios and other internal metrics cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the 

dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business we do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 49 located in the united states and 123 located outside the united states serving 190 countries reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 96 distributors covering 179 countries the fg wilson branded electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited are sold through its worldwide network of 184 distributors covering 145 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 85 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segments there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item accrued expenses in statement 3 — consolidated financial position at december 31 of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

macroeconomic risks 

our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production levels market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure material particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty this includes for example the uncertainty related to the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit”   some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  operational risks 

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and we could in the future experience similar attacks however to date no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity while we actively manage information technology security risks within our control there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems networks and data the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research 

development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions 

on september 24 2015 we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions expected to occur through 2018 to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions we expect to take additional restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred as a result of these actions we will incur charges which may include but not be limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits potential additional pension funding obligations and pension curtailments any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives 

we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which we expect to have a positive longterm effect on our business competitive position results of operations and financial condition for example one such initiative is to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and ordertodelivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements as well as to reduce waste further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers there can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if these initiatives are not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through among other things due diligence there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war terrorist acts fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

financial risks 

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations and capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings on december 13 2016 moody’s investors service moody’s downgraded the long and shortterm ratings of caterpillar and cat financial to a3 from a2 and to prime2 from prime1 a further downgrade of caterpillar or cat financial’s credit ratings by moody’s or one of the other major credit rating agencies could adversely affect caterpillar’s and cat financial’s cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in us dollars there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries 

or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements we are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material we may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

legal  regulatory risks 

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates repatriation of cash to the united states changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 5 — income taxes and note 22 — environmental and legal matters of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this annual report on form 10k  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period 

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example certain of cat financial’s activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition additional regulations in the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources the potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position

overview 

our sales and revenues for 2016 were 38537 billion down 8474 billion or 18 percent from 47011 billion in 2015 sales declined across the company reflecting weak enduser demand in most of the industries we serve including in construction oil and gas mining and rail a loss of 67 million was incurred in 2016 compared with profit of 2512 billion in 2015 the decline was primarily due to lower sales volume  the unfavorable impact of higher marktomarket losses  related to remeasurement of our pension and other postemployment benefits opeb  plans unfavorable price realization  and a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries  these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and other cost reduction actions 

fourthquarter 2016 sales and revenues were 9574 billion a 13 percent decrease from 11030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 a loss of 1171 billion was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of 94 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 the loss was 200 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss per share of 016 in the fourth quarter of 2015 profit declined primarily due to the unfavorable impact of increased marktomarket losses related to remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans a goodwill impairment charge and lower sales volume these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and other cost reduction actions and lower restructuring costs  

highlights for 2016 include 

 

restructuring costs 

in 2016 we continued to undertake a wide range of actions across the enterprise to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions restructuring costs of 395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to restructuring programs across the company during 2016 we incurred 1019 billion in restructuring costs primarily related to resource industries and energy  transportation  in 2017 we expect restructuring actions to continue and anticipate costs of about 500 million 

notes 



2016  compared with 2015 

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2015  at left and 2016  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues were 38537 billion in 2016 compared with 47011 billion in 2015 a decline of 8474 billion or 18 percent the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined most of the decrease was for new equipment    the unfavorable impact of price realization primarily in construction industries  also contributed to the decline 

sales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as inventories decreased about 16 billion in 2016 compared with a decrease of about 10 billion in 2015 the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories was primarily in north america dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions machine rental rates and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers we believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution centers we do not expect dealers will reduce inventories in 2017 as much as they did in 2016 we believe the level of dealer inventories at the end of 2017 will depend on dealer expectations for business in 2018 

sales declined in all regions    in north america sales decreased 19 percent due to lower enduser demand primarily driven by construction industries and energy  transportation and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories primarily in construction industries in eame  sales declined 22 percent primarily in africamiddle east due to weak economic conditions resulting from low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment sales decreased 29 percent in latin america  primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region the most significant decreases were in mexico and brazil    asiapacific sales declined 9 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for energy  transportation applications and products used in mining partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment mostly in china 

energy  transportation’s sales declined 22 percent largely due to lower enduser demand for oil and gas and transportation applications construction industries’ sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories    resource industries’ sales declined 26 percent mostly due to continued low enduser demand financial products’ segment  revenues were about flat 

consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2015  at left and 2016  at right items favorably impacting operating profit   appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments  and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit for 2016 was 498 million compared with 3785 billion in 2015 the decrease in profit is primarily due to lower sales volume including an unfavorable mix of products our expectation is that sales mix will continue to be unfavorable in 2017 the decrease in profit also includes an unfavorable impact from marktomarket losses related to remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans and a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries in addition price realization financial products and restructuring costs were unfavorable these items were partially offset by favorable period costs  and variable manufacturing costs  

the unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions primarily in construction industries we saw competitive pressure during 2016 that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity unfavorable currency  pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited competitors based outside the united states and an overall weak economic environment while we do not expect substantial price improvement in the coming months we do expect price realization to be neutral to slightly positive in 2017 

period costs were lower primarily due to the impact from substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense the reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing costs and selling general and administrative expenses sga variable manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and the favorable impact of cost absorption cost absorption was favorable due to inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 compared to the decrease in 2016 

restructuring costs of 1019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple restructuring actions across the company primarily in resource industries and energy  transportation    in 2015 restructuring costs were 898 million 

shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually expense in 2016 was about 250 million as compared to about 585 million in 2015 for 2017 we expect shortterm incentive compensation expense will be significantly higher than 2016 

other profitloss items 



interest in our former thirdparty logistics business this was mostly offset by a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than the net losses in 2015 

 the provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes a 141 million noncash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax assets due to recent us gaap losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance the provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a 42 million net charge to adjust prior years’ us taxes 

segment information 

  



  

 



  



construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 15612 billion in 2016 a decrease of 2185 billion or 12 percent from 2015 the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization while sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts most of the decrease was for new equipment 

 sales decreased in north america eame and latin america and were higher in asiapacific 



in 2017 due to overall economic weakness and continued pressure on economies that rely on oil revenues to drive economic growth 

 construction industries’ profit was 1650 billion in 2016 compared with 1865 billion in 2015 the decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions the decline was partially offset by favorable costs primarily due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions improved material costs the favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in 2015 the impact of cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 5726 billion in 2016 a decrease of 2013 billion or 26 percent from 2015 the decline was almost entirely due to lower sales volume sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts however most of the decrease was for new equipment aftermarket parts sales have increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters 

the sales decrease was primarily due to lower enduser demand across all regions while most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier current prices have not been sufficient to drive an increase in shortterm demand for new equipment we believe commodity prices must stabilize for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales we believe idle mining trucks on customer sites are also having a negative impact on enduser demand in 2016 mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they have for several years we believe miners’ capital spending will be about flat in 2017 after several years of decline however we believe commodity prices at higher levels than a year ago along with sequential improvements in part sales in each of the last three quarters of 2016 and improvements in quoting and order activity in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflect positive trends in resource industries that if sustained could positively impact future results 

resource industries incurred a loss of 1047 billion in 2016 compared with profit of 1 million in 2015 the most significant item impacting 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million related to the surface mining  technology reporting unit excluding the impairment charge the remaining unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization these items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions improved material costs and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 14411 billion in 2016 a decrease of 4108 billion or 22 percent from 2015 the decrease was almost entirely the result of lower sales volume sales decreased in all applications with oil and gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the energy  transportation decline 



 energy  transportation’s profit was 2222 billion in 2016 compared with 3390 billion in 2015 the decline was due to a decrease in sales volume including an unfavorable mix of products this was partially offset by lower costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions favorable material costs and lower shortterm incentive compensation expense 

financial products segment 

financial products’ revenues were 2993 billion a decrease of 85 million or 3 percent from 2015 the decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets  in asiapacific and latin america an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment primarily in north america and lower average financing rates in latin america these decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in north america 

financial products’ profit was 702 million in 2016 compared with 809 million in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in sga expenses 

at the end of 2016 past dues at cat financial were 238 percent compared with 214 percent at the end of 2015 the increase in past dues was primarily driven by the european marine portfolio writeoffs net of recoveries were 123 million for the fullyear 2016 compared with 155 million for the fullyear 2015 

as of december 31 2016 cat financials allowance for credit losses totaled 343 million or 129 percent of net finance receivables compared with 338 million or 122 percent of net finance receivables at yearend 2015 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 2712 billion in 2016 which was an increase of 766 million compared with 2015 corporate items and eliminations include corporatelevel expenses restructuring costs timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology and intersegment eliminations 

the most significant item was the unfavorable impact of marktomarket losses related to remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket losses in 2016 were 985 million compared to marktomarket losses of 179 million in 2015 the remaining decrease in expense of 40 million was primarily due to a favorable impact from methodology differences partially offset by a 121 million increase in restructuring costs 

fourth quarter 2016  compared with fourth quarter 2015

total sales and revenues were 9574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 a decline of 1456 billion or 13 percent compared with 11030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 the decrease was almost entirely due to lower sales volume resulting from lower enduser demand attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries although some commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter of 2016 the improvement was too recent to significantly impact our sales for the quarter sales for new equipment declined while aftermarket parts sales were about flat the unfavorable impact of price realization also contributed to the decline 

sales declined in all regions except asiapacific in eame sales declined 30 percent primarily in africamiddle east due to weak economic conditions resulting from the continuing impact of low oil prices and an uncertain investment environment in north america sales decreased 15 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for equipment used for infrastructure the impact of continued low oil prices and an uncertain economic environment sales decreased 16 percent in latin america primarily due to continued widespread economic weakness and inflation across the region asiapacific sales increased 10 percent primarily due to increased infrastructure and residential investment in china 

energy  transportation’s sales declined 15 percent largely due to lower enduser demand for most applications resource industries’ sales declined 23 percent mostly due to continued low enduser demand construction industries’ sales decreased 8 percent primarily due to lower demand from end users partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories financial products’ segment revenues were about flat with the fourth quarter of 2015 

consolidated operating profit  loss 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit loss between the fourth quarter of 2015  at left and the fourth quarter of 2016  at right items favorably impacting operating profit   appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses 

operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 1262 billion compared with a loss of 175 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 an unfavorable change of 1087 billion the most significant items were the unfavorable impact from marktomarket losses related to pension and opeb plans and a goodwill impairment charge in resource industries excluding these items operating profit improved 279 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 the improvement was mostly due to lower period costs a decrease in restructuring costs and favorable variable manufacturing costs partially offset by lower sales volume the unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions primarily in resource industries 

period costs were lower primarily due to substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year the reductions impacted period manufacturing costs selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses about equally variable manufacturing costs were favorable mostly due to the impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 

restructuring costs of 395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to restructuring programs across the company in the fourth quarter of 2015 restructuring costs were 679 million primarily related to a reduction in workforce 

other profitloss items 

 the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016 also includes a 170 million charge related to the change from the thirdquarter estimated annual tax rate of 25 percent the increase is primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the surface mining  technology goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting benefits related to the majority of pension and opeb marktomarket losses taxed at higher us rates in addition the provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes a 141 million noncash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax 

assets due to recent us gaap losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 also included a benefit of 92 million related to the decrease from the thirdquarter estimated annual tax rate primarily due to the renewal in the fourth quarter of the us research and development tax credit for 2015

the sales decrease was primarily due to lower enduser demand across all regions while most commodity prices were higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2015 current prices have not been sufficient to drive much increase in shortterm demand for new equipment we believe commodity prices now need to stabilize for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they have for several years in addition sales of heavy construction equipment are lower primarily in north america 

resource industries incurred a loss of 711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of 80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 the most significant item impacting the fourth quarter of 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million related to the surface mining  technology reporting unit excluding the impairment charge the fourth quarter of 2016 operating loss was unfavorable 36 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 the unfavorable change was due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization mostly offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2014  at left and 2015  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

  

total sales and revenues were 47011 billion in 2015 down 8173 billion or 15 percent from 2014 the decrease was largely due to lower sales volume primarily in energy  transportation and construction industries sales volume was also lower in resource industries currency had an unfavorable impact of 17 billion due to continued strengthening of the us dollar against most currencies with the largest impact from the euro while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in energy  transportation construction industries and resource industries most of the decrease was for new equipment financial products’ revenues declined 178 million 

while price realization was about flat from 2014 to 2015 it was positive in the first half of 2015 and negative over the second half of 2015 

the two most significant reasons for the decline in sales and revenues from 2014 were weakening economic growth and substantially lower commodity prices the impact of weak economic growth was most pronounced in developing countries such as china and brazil lower oil prices had a substantial negative impact on the portion of energy  transportation that supports oil drilling and well servicing where new order rates in 2015 were down close to 90 percent from 2014 

the impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories was about flat in total dealer inventories decreased about 1 billion in both 2015 and 2014 dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels in general dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 

sales declined in all regions sales in north america declined 11 percent primarily in energy  transportation with the most significant decrease in rail applications sales also declined in resource industries and construction industries in asiapacific sales declined 19 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for construction and mining equipment and oil and gas applications the impact of currency was also unfavorable as our sales in japanese yen and australian dollars translated into fewer us dollars in eame sales declined 14 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency as our sales in euros translated into fewer us dollars the remaining sales decline is primarily due to lower sales in russia as a recession slowed demand and the absence of a large power generation project that occurred in 2014 latin america sales decreased 28 percent due 

to lower enduser demand mostly for construction equipment the decline was due to continued widespread economic weakness across the region with the most significant decline in brazil due to continued weak construction activity resulting from depressed economic conditions 

by segment sales decreased in energy  transportation construction industries and resource industries energy  transportation’s sales declined 17 percent with much of the decline a result of low oil prices construction industries’ sales declined 14 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand and the unfavorable impact of currency resource industries’ sales declined 15 percent primarily due to weaker demand for mining products partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealer inventories decreased more in 2014 than in 2015 financial products segment revenues decreased 7 percent primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates 

  

consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2014  at left and 2015  at right items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses 

  

operating profit for 2015 was 3785 billion an increase of 471 million from 2014 the most significant item was the favorable impact of lower net marktomarket losses related to our pension and opeb plans remaining was a decline of 1974 billion which was primarily the result of lower sales volume higher restructuring costs and higher variable manufacturing costs partially offset by lower period costs and the favorable impact of currency 

restructuring costs of 898 million in 2015 included in corporate items were primarily related to a reduction in workforce across the company in 2014 restructuring costs were 432 million primarily related to a workforce reduction at the gosselies belgium facility and other actions across the company our restructuring activities continued in 2015 as part of our efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations 

variable manufacturing costs were higher primarily due to the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as there was a more significant inventory decline in 2015 than 2014 and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume these costs were partially offset by improved material costs due to declines in commodity prices and a focus on reducing the cost of components in our products 

period costs were lower primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense slightly offset by higher spending for new product introductions 

the favorable impact of currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and british pound as we are a net exporter from japan and the united kingdom 

shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2015 was about 585 million compared to about 13 billion of shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2014 shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually 

other profitloss items 

other incomeexpense  was income of 161 million in 2015 compared with income of 322 million in 2014 the change was primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of currency translation and hedging gains and losses partially offset by a gain of 120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third party logistics business translation and hedging losses in 2015 totaled 173 million primarily due to the brazilian real and japanese yen in 2014 translation and hedging gains were 137 million primarily due to the euro 

the provision for income taxes  for 2015 reflects an effective tax rate of 255 percent compared with 234 percent for 2014 excluding the items discussed below the increase is primarily due to a less favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective in 2015 as lower marktomarket losses related to our pension and opeb plans were partially offset by higher restructuring costs both primarily at higher us tax rates 

the provision for income taxes for 2015 also includes a 42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by 68 million partially offset by a benefit of 26 million to record us refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination our consideration of decisions by the us court of appeals for the second circuit in 2015 involving other taxpayers caused us to increase our unrecognized tax benefits related to foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings 

the 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of 23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a nonus subsidiary and a net benefit of 21 million to adjust prior years’ us taxes and interest 

segment information 



 





construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 17797 billion in 2015 a decrease of 2793 billion or 14 percent from 2014 the sales decrease was due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined most of the decrease was for new equipment 

 sales decreased in all geographic regions 



 construction industries’ profit was 1865 billion in 2015 compared with 2133 billion in 2014 the decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by lower costs and the favorable impact of currency the decline in costs was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and improved material costs 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 7739 billion in 2015 a decrease of 1395 billion or 15 percent from 2014 primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency mostly the euro and australian dollar price realization was slightly unfavorable resulting from a competitive pricing environment sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts we believe some mining companies were curtailing maintenance and rebuild activities 

commodity prices were weak and mining customers focused on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they did for the last several years as a result sales and new orders in resource industries weakened 

the sales volume decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers reduced inventories in 2015 the reductions were less significant than in 2014 

sales decreased in all geographic regions 

 resource industries’ profit was 1 million in 2015 compared with profit of 565 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume higher spending for new product introductions and unfavorable price realization partially offset by improved material costs 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 18519 billion in 2015 a decrease of 3787 billion or 17 percent from 2014 the sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency mainly from a weaker euro sales decreased in all geographic regions and across all applications 



during the first half of 2015 sales remained at relatively high levels for equipment used in gas compression well servicing and drilling because we started the year with a substantial order backlog sales declined during the second half of 2015 as orders from the backlog were shipped and new order levels were weak 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 3390 billion in 2015 compared with 4287 billion in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume which includes a favorable mix of products partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense 

variable manufacturing costs were about flat as improved material costs were about offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume the unfavorable impact of cost absorption resulted from a significant decrease in inventory in 2015 compared to an increase in inventory in 2014 

period costs were favorable as lower incentive compensation expense was slightly offset by increases in program spending including for new product introductions 

financial products segment 

financial products’ revenues were 3078 billion a decrease of 235 million or 7 percent from 2014 the decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates average earning assets were down in asiapacific latin america and eame partially offset by higher average earning assets in north america average financing rates decreased primarily in north america and eame 

financial products’ profit was 809 million in 2015 compared with 901 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to a 68 million decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting changes in the geographic mix of margin and currency impacts and a 55 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets partially offset by a 33 million decrease in the provision for credit losses at cat financial the decrease in provision for credit losses at cat financial was primarily due to a favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate and a favorable impact from changes in portfolio balances partially offset by an increase in writeoffs net of recoveries the favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate was driven by changes in certain assumptions within the allowance for credit loss model during 2015 as a result of managements review the loss emergence period and loss given default assumptions were updated and resulted in a decrease to the allowance for credit losses of 66 million 

at the end of 2015 past dues at cat financial were 214 percent compared with 217 percent at the end of 2014 writeoffs net of recoveries were 155 million for the fullyear 2015 compared with 104 million for the fullyear 2014 the increase in writeoffs net of recoveries was primarily driven by the mining and marine portfolios 

as of december 31 2015 cat financials allowance for credit losses totaled 338 million or 122 percent of net finance receivables compared with 401 million or 136 percent of net finance receivables at yearend 2014 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 1946 billion in 2015 a decrease of 2367 billion from 2014 corporate items and eliminations include corporatelevel expenses restructuring costs timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates and intersegment eliminations 

the most significant item was the favorable impact of net marktomarket losses related to our pension and opeb plans net marktomarket losses in 2015 were 179 million compared to net marktomarket losses of 2624 billion in 2014 the remaining increase in expense in 2015 was primarily due to a 466 million increase in restructuring costs and an unfavorable impact from 

methodology differences partially offset by a favorable impact from timing differences and lower retirement benefits costs excluding marktomarket losses 

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs for 2016 2015 and 2014 were as follows 



the restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in resource industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry in addition costs resulted from our decision to discontinue production of onhighway vocational trucks and other restructuring actions across the company most of which were related to our september 2015 announcement regarding significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to weak economic and business conditions in most of the industries we serve the restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company the restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our gosselies belgium facility 

restructuring costs are a reconciling item between segment profit and consolidated profit before taxes 

the following table summarizes the 2015  and 2016  employee separation activity 



  

as part of our september 2015 announcement we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying us employees and various voluntary separation programs outside of the us and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company in 2016 and 2015 we incurred 100 million and 379 million of employee separation costs related to these programs respectively in addition in 2015 we incurred 82 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program were paid in 2016 we also incurred costs associated with the september 2015 announcement related to manufacturing facility consolidations and closures in 2016 and 2015 totaling 181 million and 108 million respectively the remaining liability balance as of december 31 2016  represents costs for other employee separation programs most of which are expected to be paid in 2017 

  

in february 2016 we made the decision to discontinue production of onhighway vocational trucks within energy  transportation based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business the company decided it would withdraw from this market we estimate restructuring costs incurred under the restructuring plan to be 110 million in 2016 we recognized 104 million of restructuring costs primarily for longlived asset impairments and sales discounts related to this restructuring plan the remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017 

in the second half of 2016 we took additional restructuring actions in resource industries including ending the production of track drills pursuing strategic alternatives including the possible divestiture of room and pillar products consolidation of two product development divisions and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry we estimate restructuring costs incurred under these restructuring plans to be 385 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we incurred 369 million of restructuring costs related to these plans which included 164 million of longlived asset impairments 120 million of employee separation costs 81 million of inventory writedowns and 4 million of other costs the remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017 

in 2017 we expect to incur about 500 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions no estimate of potential restructuring costs for contemplated actions at gosselies belgium or aurora illinois has been included we are expecting about 450 million of cost reduction in 2017 from lower operating costs primarily sga expenses and cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring actions

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our met operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio despite continued weakness in many of the industries we serve we had positive operating cash flow in 2016 on a consolidated basis we ended 2016 with 717 billion of cash an increase of 708 million from yearend 2015 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position 

our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 52 billion held by our nonus subsidiaries amounts held by nonus subsidiaries are available for general corporate use however if cash held by nonus subsidiaries were repatriated to the united states us tax would generally be payable net of any available foreign tax credits 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2016 was 561 billion down from 668 billion in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit after adjustments for noncash items the most significant driver of lower earnings was a decrease in sales volume during 2016 higher payments for employee separations in 2016 than 2015 also contributed to the decline in operating cash flow operating cash flow benefited from lower cash payments for shortterm incentive compensation in 2016 than 2015 a portion of this benefit was reflected in profit through lower accruals for incentive compensation expense in 2016 in addition positive changes to working capital in 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow within working capital changes to accounts payable and customer advances had favorable impacts to cash flow but were partially offset by lower inventory reductions these reductions in working capital were also primarily a result of lower sales volume see further discussion of operating cash flow under met and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2016 was 3678 billion a decrease of 123 billion from yearend 2015 debt related to financial products decreased 896 million reflecting decreasing portfolio funding requirements debt related to met decreased 334 million in 2016 due to the maturity of a longterm debt issuance 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on managements allocation decision which can be revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to met as of december 31 2016 was 275 billion our three global credit facilities are 

 

at december 31 2016 caterpillars consolidated net worth was 1320 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2016 cat financials covenant interest coverage ratio was 192 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2016 cat financials sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 735 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 760 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2016 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2016  were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2016  totaled 382 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

we receive debt ratings from the major rating agencies in december 2016 moodys investors service downgraded our longterm ratings to a3 from a2 and shortterm ratings to prime2 from prime1 we do not expect the moodys downgrade to have a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health a further downgrade of our credit ratings by moodys or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable our met operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios

net cash provided by operating activities was 386 billion in 2016 compared with 518 billion in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit after adjustments for noncash items the most significant driver of lower earnings was a decrease in sales volume during 2016 higher payments for employee separations in 2016 than 2015 also contributed to the decline in operating cash flow operating cash flow benefited from lower cash payments for shortterm incentive compensation in 2016 than 2015 a portion of this benefit was reflected in profit through lower accruals for incentive compensation expense in 2016 in addition positive changes to working capital in 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow within working capital changes to accounts payable and customer advances had favorable impacts to cash flow but were partially offset by lower inventory reductions these reductions in working capital were also primarily a result of lower sales volume 

net cash used for investing activities in both 2016 and 2015 was 178 billion increased lending activity with financial products in 2016 was offset by lower capital expenditures versus 2015 

net cash used for financing activities in 2016 was 213 billion compared with net cash used of 424 billion in 2015 the favorable change was primarily due to the absence of common stock repurchases in 2016 as compared to 2015 

  

although our shortterm priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business conditions dictate our longterm cash deployment strategy remains unchanged to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating provide capital to support growth appropriately fund employee benefit plans pay dividends and repurchase common stock 

  

strong financial position   —  a key measure of mets financial strength used by management is mets debttocapital ratio debttocapital is defined as shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year and longterm debt due after one year debt divided by the sum of debt and stockholders equity debt also includes mets longterm borrowings from financial products the debttocapital ratio for met was 410 percent at december 31 2016 within our target range of 30 to 45 percent the met debttocapital ratio was 390 percent at december 31 2015 the increase in the debttocapital ratio was due to a decrease in equity primarily resulting from dividend payments 

  

capital to support growth   —  capital expenditures during 2016 were 121 billion we expect mets capital expenditures in 2017 to be about flat with 2016 

  

appropriately funded employee benefit plans   —  we made 329 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2016 versus 350 million of contributions in 2015 we expect that required employee benefit plan contributions of approximately 610 million will be required in 2017 we believe we have adequate resources to fund our employee benefit plans 

  

paying dividends   —  dividends paid totaled 180 billion in 2016 representing 77 cents per share paid per quarter each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend 

  

common stock repurchases   —  in january 2014 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2014 authorization which will expire on december 31 2018 we did not purchase any caterpillar common stock in 2016 as of december 31 2016 547 billion remained available under the 2014 authorization caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2016 were 586 million 

  

financial products 

  

financial products operating cash flow was 155 billion in 2016 compared with 139 billion in 2015 net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was 299 million compared with cash used for investing activities of 102 billion in 2015 the change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements net cash used for financing activities in 2016 was 107 billion compared with 228 million in 2015 the change was primarily due to lower funding requirements for investing activities 



contractual obligations 

  

the company has committed cash outflow related to longterm debt operating lease agreements postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations interest on longterm debt and other longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  minimum payments for these obligations were 

  



  

 



the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits was 1032 million at december 31 2016 payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements these obligations are not included in the table above we do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests impairment of availableforsale securities warranty liability stockbased compensation reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments these assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets  – the residual values for cat financial’s leased assets which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors market size and demand any known significant marketproduct trends total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities past remarketing experience thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for noncompliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model changes and updates as well as market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure 

during the term of the equipment on operating leases we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis for finance leases residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue 

we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred when a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value 

at december 31 2016 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 227 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 90 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a twostep process if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the twostep process the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the companys market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participants perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures the fair value determination is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs 

in 2015 our resource industries segment had two reporting units with goodwill hauling  extraction and material handling  underground effective january 1 2016 product responsibility for offhighway trucks and wheel tractor scrapers transferred from hauling  extraction to material handling  underground and the former hauling  extraction reporting unit was renamed surface mining  technology as a result of the transfer in product responsibility approximately 500 million of goodwill was 

reassigned from hauling  extraction to material handling  underground based on the relative fair value of the products transferred to the total fair value of hauling  extraction after the reassignment of goodwill surface mining  technology and material handling  underground had goodwill of approximately 12 billion and 24 billion respectively as of january 1 2016 because the former hauling  extraction reporting unit’s fair value was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of october 1 2015 we tested surface mining  technologys goodwill for impairment as of january 1 2016 and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying value 

our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill with the exception of our surface mining  technology reporting unit caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

the surface mining  technology reporting unit which primarily serves the mining industry is a part of our resource industries segment the goodwill assigned to this reporting unit is largely from our acquisition of bucyrus international inc in 2011 its product portfolio includes large mining trucks electric rope shovels draglines hydraulic shovels and related parts in addition to equipment surface mining  technology also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customer fleet management equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the fair value of surface mining  technology was below its carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process we assigned the fair value to surface mining  technology’s assets and liabilities using various valuation techniques that required assumptions about royalty rates dealer attrition technological obsolescence and discount rates the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value accordingly we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 595 million which resulted in goodwill of 629 million remaining for surface mining  technology as of october 1 2016 there was a 17 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge the mining industry has experienced significant weakness for several years as a result of low commodity prices while we continue to expect the industry will improve we believe the pace of the improvement will be slower and cash flows and profitability will be lower than previously forecasted we believe the slow pace of improvement will in part be due to a large amount of equipment currently idled particularly large mining trucks some of which will be redeployed as enduser demand increases in addition we do not expect a dramatic increase in commodity prices dampening the rate of growth in mining production and demand for our products to reflect the gradual nature of the anticipated improvement we used a ten year cash flow forecast period for the reporting unit rather than our typical five year forecast period 

in addition to surface mining  technology our resource industries segment has a reporting unit material handling  underground which includes goodwill of approximately 24 billion as of october 1 2016 also largely from our acquisition of bucyrus international inc in 2011 material handling  underground’s product portfolio includes large tracktype tractors hard rock vehicles longwall miners track and rotary drills highwall miners large wheel loaders offhighway trucks articulated trucks wheeltractor scrapers wheel dozers landfill compactors soil compactors material handlers continuous miners scoops and haulers hardrock continuous mining systems and related parts the fair value of material handling  underground remains substantially above its carrying value 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process a goodwill impairment would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

impairment of availableforsale securities  –   availableforsale securities primarily at insurance services are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value 

  

for debt securities once a security’s fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred these reviews which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed otherthantemporarily impaired at any time once a security’s fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original 

cost for six consecutive months the security will be otherthantemporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise 

  

for equity securities in a loss position determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired requires an analysis of that securitys historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return this information is utilized to estimate a security’s future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates 

for both debt and equity securities qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired these include reviews of the following significant changes in the regulatory economic or technological environment of the investee significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

  

warranty liability  – at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

stockbased compensation  – we use a latticebased optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and sars the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the latticebased optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following 

  

   

the fair value of our rsus and prsus is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividends are based on caterpillar’s quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant a decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense 

  

stockbased compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest in determining the stockbased compensation expense to be recognized a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award this rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on caterpillar employee historical behavior changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate a decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense stockbased compensation expense for prsus is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve  – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels 

  

postretirement benefits  – primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

 

at december 31 2015 we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost historically these components were determined utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate based on the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve this change has no impact on our pension and other postretirement liabilities and has been accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of 2016 

 

 

 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses we recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement 

see note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve  – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 1288 million and 1191 million as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

credit loss reserve  – the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management takes into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions 

accounts are identified for individual review based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees the allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes  – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities 

our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes the trend of us gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for 2016 includes an increase in the valuation allowance for us state deferred tax assets resulting in a 141 million noncash charge net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent the primary driver of the increase is recent us gaap losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance reversal of the valuation allowance in the future is dependent on us gaap profitability in these state jurisdictions giving less weight in the analysis to marktomarket adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends 

a provision for us income taxes has not been recorded on undistributed profits of our nonus subsidiaries that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us if management intentions or us tax law changes in the future there could be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs a deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a us tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future 

income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation that statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate in part due to indefinitely reinvested profits of nonus subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which are generally lower than the us rate of 35 

percent the indefinitely reinvested profits of caterpillar sarl csarl primarily taxable in switzerland contribute the most significant amount of this difference for tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines we are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately 2 billion we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

other matters 

  

environmental and legal matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required 

on january 8 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of illinois the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning us and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of nonus subsidiaries and the movement of cash among us and nonus subsidiaries the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain nonus caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures the company is cooperating with this investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on september 10 2014 the sec issued to caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the company’s accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of bucyrus international inc in 2011 and related matters the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation and the company is cooperating with the sec regarding its ongoing investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on march 20 2014 brazil’s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants including two subsidiaries of caterpillar inc mge  equipamentos e serviços ferroviários ltda mge and caterpillar brasil ltda the publication of the technical opinion opened cades official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in brazil while companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in brazil criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of mge and one former employee of mge involving the same conduct alleged by cade the company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on october 24 2013 progress rail received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of california the subpoena requests documents and information from progress rail united industries corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of progress rail and caterpillar inc relating to allegations that progress rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts equipment tools and other items in connection with this subpoena progress rail was informed by the us attorney for the central district of california that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices the company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter although the company believes a loss is probable we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters or intellectual property rights the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

retirement benefits 

we recognize marktomarket gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans marktomarket gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on marktomarket gains and losses 

we recognized expense of 957 million in 2016 expense of 292 million in 2015 and expense of 271 billion in 2014 related to our defined benefit pension and opeb plans the increase in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher net marktomarket loss in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower expected return on plan assets as a result of a lower asset base in 2016 compared to 2015 and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets this was partially offset by lower interest costs primarily due to adoption of a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost discussed below and lower service costs primarily due to fewer employees earning benefits under our plans as a result of the us voluntary retirement enhancement program that was implemented in the fourth quarter 2015 the decrease in expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a lower net marktomarket loss in 2015 compared to 2014 

the primary factors that resulted in marktomarket losses for 2016 2015 and 2014 are described below 

 

the net marktomarket losses were in the following results of operations line items 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 the mortality assumption for our us pension and opeb plans was reviewed to consider the use of new tables that were released by the society of actuaries soa as of december 31 2014 the company adopted the new tables with modifications to reflect historical company specific mortality experience and its best estimate of future mortality improvements the adoption of the new tables resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 400 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the mortality assumption for our us pension and opeb plans was reviewed to consider the use of new mortality improvement projection scales that were released by the soa as of december 31 2016 the company adopted the new mortality improvement projection scales which resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 200 million 

at december 31 2015 we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost historically these components were determined utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve under the previous method the discount rate used for the service and interest components of cost would have been 42 percent for us pensions 32 percent for nonus pension and 41 percent for opeb this change had no impact on our yearend defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss gain reported compared to the method used in 2015 this change lowered service and interest costs by 180 million 

we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense excluding the impact of marktomarket gains and losses to increase approximately 50 million in 2017 

in general our strategy for both the us and the nonus pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio for our us pension plans our yearend 2016 asset allocation was 41 percent equity securities 56 percent fixed income securities and 3 percent other our current us pension target asset allocations is 40 percent equity and 60 percent fixed income the target allocations will be revisited periodically to reflect our overall objectives the us plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis 

the yearend 2016 asset allocation for our nonus pension plans was 38 percent equity securities 55 percent fixed income securities 5 percent real estate and 2 percent other the 2016 target allocation for our nonus pension plans was 39 percent equity securities 52 percent fixed income securities 6 percent real estate and 3 percent other the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the nonus plans varies depending on the plan 

contributions to our pension and opeb plans were 329 million and 350 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect to make approximately 610 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2017 we believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and opeb plans 

actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and opeb expenses the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2016 benefit costs and yearend obligations are included in the table below 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

following are the effects of a one percentagepoint change in our primary pension and opeb actuarial assumptions included in the following table on 2016  pension and other opeb costs and obligations 

  

  



sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

machinery energy  transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy  transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2017  cash flow for our machinery 

energy  transportation operations by approximately 143 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 318 million adverse impact on 2016  cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

since our policy for financial products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the japanese yen euro chinese yuan british pound and australian dollar 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our machinery energy  transportation operations we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2017  pretax earnings of machinery energy  transportation last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2016 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating leases within certain parameters in connection with that policy we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads regardless of the direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2016  balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential 6 million adverse impact on 2017 pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 13 million adverse impact to 2016  pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

the following definitions are provided for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several special items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers these items consist of i restructuring costs which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits ii pension and opeb marktomarket losses resulting from plan remeasurements iii goodwill impairment charges and iv state deferred tax valuation allowances we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the nongaap measure will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and a means to assess our periodoverperiod results 

reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable gaap measure consolidated profit before taxes are as follows 



reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure diluted profit per share are as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis the data has been grouped as follows 

  

consolidated – caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries 

  

machinery energy  transportation – caterpillar defines machinery energy  transportation as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries with financial products accounted for on the equity basis machinery energy  transportation information relates to the design manufacturing and marketing of our products financial products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment the nature of these businesses is different especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences we also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as that term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based on that evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of caterpillar inc company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  2013 based on our assessment we concluded that as of december 31 2016  the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm their report appears on page 69 of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

other information about our operations in 2015  including certain risks associated with our operations is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining 

  

customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine to meet customer expectations in developing economies caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies in those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements we continued our multiyear roll out of products designed to meet those requirements the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2015 focused on the next generation of construction machines 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh industrial nv deere  company hitachi construction machinery co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai construction equipment part of hyundai heavy industries as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xiamen xgma machinery co ltd xcmg group the shandong heavy industry group co ltd shantui construction machinery co ltd strong construction machinery co ltd and 

shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications caterpillar offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry we manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world our equipment is used to extract and haul copper iron ore coal oil sands aggregates gold and other minerals and ores in addition to equipment resource industries also develops and sells technology to provide customers fleet management systems equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities 

customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment in some developing markets customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions we believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality most productive products in the industry 

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products applications and regional markets our global surface competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment atlas copco ab and sandvik mining our global underground competitors include joy global inc atlas copco ab sandvik mining and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd 

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



  

energy  transportation 

  

our energy  transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas power generation marine rail and industrial applications including cat® machines the product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines generator sets marine propulsion systems gas turbines and turbinerelated services dieselelectric locomotives and other railrelated products and services 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine oil and gas industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc rollsroyce power system ge oil  gas ge power  water deutz ag and wärtsilä corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se siemens energy rollsroyce marine mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co inc aggreko plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens akteingesellschaft alstom transport sa and voestalpine ag we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm trade receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america cat financial also has offices and subsidiaries in asiapacific europe and latin america 

  

for over 30 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 53 percent include 

  

 

 

 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 13 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 34 percent include 

  

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2015 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio this matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data see also the risk factors on pages 9 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience customer financial information creditrating agency ratings loantovalue ratios and other internal metrics cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 85 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segments there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions economic growth government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production levels market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity price changes component price increases fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures and support growth fund our employee retirement benefit programs pay dividends and buy back stock continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

   

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either caterpillar or cat financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor by seeking other funding 

sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

  

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example certain of cat financial’s activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank a comprehensive financial reform act signed into law in july 2010 that includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition additional regulations in 

the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities 

the risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and enduser customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts changes in our competitors’ behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives 

we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which we expect to have a positive effect on our business competitive position results of operations and financial condition for example we formed the caterpillar enterprise system group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and ordertodelivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements as well as to reduce waste further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers we are also in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning erp systems in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations there can be no assurance that these erp systems these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if our new erp systems are not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions 

on september 24 2015 we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions we expect to take additional restructuring actions through 2018 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred as a result of these actions we will likely continue to incur charges which may include but not be limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits potential additional pension funding obligations and pension curtailments any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand additionally some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources these liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations in addition we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws regulations and business practices that differ from those in the united states there is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 5 — income taxes and note 22 — environmental and legal matters of part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data to this annual report on form 10k  

  

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition changes in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period 

  

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and we could in the future experience similar attacks however to date no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity while we actively manage information technology security risks within our control there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems networks and data the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war terrorist acts fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

2015  compared with 2014 

consolidated sales and revenues 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2014  at left and 2015  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

total sales and revenues were 47011 billion in 2015 down 8173 billion or 15 percent from 2014 the decrease was largely due to lower sales volume primarily in energy  transportation and construction industries  sales volume was also lower in resource industries  currency  had an unfavorable impact of 17 billion due to continued strengthening of the us dollar against most currencies with the largest impact from the euro we expect the continued strength of the us dollar to negatively impact sales in 2016 while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in energy  transportation construction industries and resource industries most of the decrease was for new equipment financial products’ revenues declined 178 million 

while price realization  was about flat from 2014 to 2015 it was positive in the first half of 2015 and negative over the second half of 2015 we expect that negative trend to continue in 2016 we are experiencing pricing pressure from the competitive nature of the businesses we are in and from the impact of a stronger us dollar 

the two most significant reasons for the decline in sales and revenues from 2014 were weakening economic growth and substantially lower commodity prices the impact of weak economic growth was most pronounced in developing countries such as china and brazil lower oil prices had a substantial negative impact on the portion of energy  transportation that supports oil drilling and well servicing where new order rates in 2015 were down close to 90 percent from 2014 we do not expect an improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices in 2016 and expect our 2016 sales and revenues to be lower than 2015 

the impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories was about flat in total dealer inventories decreased about 1 billion in both 2015 and 2014 we expect that a further decline in sales in 2016 will cause dealers to reduce inventory levels about as much as they did in 2015 dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels in general dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 

sales declined in all regions sales in north america declined 11 percent primarily in energy  transportation with the most significant decrease in rail applications sales also declined in resource industries and construction industries in asiapacific sales declined 19 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for construction and mining equipment and oil and gas applications the impact of currency was also unfavorable as our sales in japanese yen and australian dollars translated into fewer us dollars in eame  sales declined 14 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency as our sales in euros 

translated into fewer us dollars the remaining sales decline is primarily due to lower sales in russia as a recession slowed demand and the absence of a large power generation project that occurred in 2014  latin america  sales decreased 28 percent due to lower enduser demand mostly for construction equipment the decline was due to continued widespread economic weakness across the region with the most significant decline in brazil due to continued weak construction activity resulting from depressed economic conditions 

by segment sales decreased in energy  transportation construction industries and resource industries energy  transportation’s sales declined 17 percent with much of the decline a result of low oil prices construction industries’ sales declined 14 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand and the unfavorable impact of currency resource industries’ sales declined 15 percent primarily due to weaker demand for mining products partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealer inventories decreased more in 2014 than in 2015 financial products segment revenues decreased 7 percent primarily due to lower average earning assets  and lower average financing rates 

consolidated operating profit 

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2014  at left and 2015  at right items favorably impacting operating profit   appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments  and machinery energy  transportation other operating income expenses  

operating profit for 2015 was 3256 billion a decrease of 2072 billion from 2014 the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs partially offset by lower manufacturing costs  the favorable impact of currency and lower sga and rd expenses  

restructuring costs of 908 million in 2015 included in corporate items were primarily related to a reduction in workforce across the company in 2014 restructuring costs were 441 million primarily related to a workforce reduction at the gosselies belgium facility and other actions across the company our restructuring activities continued in 2015 as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations in 2016 we expect to incur restructuring costs related to programs started in 2015 and for additional actions to further improve our longterm cost structure 

manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to improved material costs and lower incentive compensation expense favorable material costs were due to declines in commodity prices and a focus on reducing the cost of components in our products these lower costs were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as there was a more significant inventory decline in 2015 than 2014 and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume in 2016 we expect lower material costs as a result of lower commodity prices and supplier collaboration favorable cost absorption as we expect a smaller inventory decline in 2016 than in 2015 and favorable variable manufacturing costs as we focus on operational improvements 

the favorable impact of currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and british pound as we are a net exporter from japan and the united kingdom 

sga and rd expenses declined as lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by higher spending for new product introductions 

shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2015 was about 585 million compared to about 13 billion of shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2014 shortterm incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually 

in 2016 we expect a greater proportion of the expected sales decline will occur in higher margin products for the oil and gas and mining industries likely resulting in an unfavorable impact on operating margin 

other profitloss items 

other incomeexpense  was income of 106 million in 2015 compared with income of 239 million in 2014 the change was primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of currency translation and hedging gains and losses partially offset by a gain of 120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third party logistics business translation and hedging losses in 2015 totaled 228 million primarily due to the brazilian real and japanese yen in 2014 translation and hedging gains were 54 million primarily due to the euro 

the  provision for income taxes  for 2015 reflects an estimated annual tax rate of 245 percent compared with 28 percent for 2014 excluding the items discussed below the decrease is primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective in 2015 including the impact of restructuring costs primarily at higher us tax rates 

the provision for income taxes for 2015 also includes a 42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by 68 million partially offset by a benefit of 26 million to record us refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination our consideration of decisions by the us court of appeals for the second circuit in 2015 involving other taxpayers caused us to increase our unrecognized tax benefits related to foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings 

the 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of 23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a nonus subsidiary and a net benefit of 21 million to adjust prior years’ us taxes and interest

construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 16568 billion in 2015 a decrease of 2794 billion or 14 percent from 2014 the sales decrease was due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined most of the decrease was for new equipment 

 sales decreased in all geographic regions 

 31 

 construction industries’ profit was 1925 billion in 2015 compared with 2207 billion in 2014 the decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume partially offset by lower manufacturing costs sga and rd expenses and the favorable impact of currency manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and improved material costs sga and rd expenses were lower primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 7551 billion in 2015 a decrease of 1370 billion or 15 percent from 2014 primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency mostly the euro and australian dollar price realization was slightly unfavorable resulting from a competitive pricing environment sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts we believe some mining companies are continuing to curtail maintenance and rebuild activities 

commodity prices remained weak and mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they have for the last several years as a result sales and new orders in resource industries continued to weaken we are expecting a further decline in sales volume in 2016 as a result of continued reductions in miningrelated commodity prices and difficult financial conditions for many mining customers around the world 

the sales volume decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories while dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015 the reductions were less significant than in 2014 

sales decreased in all geographic regions 

 resource industries’ loss was 88 million in 2015 compared with profit of 404 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume higher spending for new product introductions and unfavorable price realization partially offset by lower manufacturing costs primarily from improved material costs we expect unfavorable price realization in 2016 due to continued pricing pressure from the competitive nature of the business and the impact of a stronger us dollar 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 17938 billion in 2015 a decrease of 3789 billion or 17 percent from 2014 the sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency mainly from a weaker euro sales decreased in all geographic regions and across all applications 

 32 

inventories decreased in 2015 and were about flat in 2014 in latin america sales were lower primarily due to the absence of a large project that occurred in 2014 sales declined in eame due to depressed oil prices and the unfavorable impact of currency primarily from a weaker euro 

during the first half of 2015 sales remained at relatively high levels for equipment used in gas compression well servicing and drilling because we started the year with a substantial order backlog sales declined during the second half of 2015 as orders from the backlog were shipped and new order levels were weak because of that impact along with the further decline in oil prices we expect reciprocating engine sales in well servicing drilling and gas compression to decline in 2016 sales in our turbine business are also expected to decline in 2016 based on the current backlog and recent quotation activity decreases in turbine sales related to oil projects in 2016 are expected to more than offset increases in turbine sales related to gas compression 

 while oil and gas represents the most significant decline continuing weakness in economic conditions in much of the world is expected to be negative for sales of power generation equipment industrial engines marine and rail in 2016 

energy  transportation’s profit was 3239 billion in 2015 compared with 4135 billion in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume which includes a favorable mix of products partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense 

excluding incentive compensation expense manufacturing costs were about flat as improved material costs were about offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume the unfavorable impact of cost absorption resulted from a significant decrease in inventory in 2015 compared to an increase in inventory in 2014 

sga and rd expenses were favorable as lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by increases in program spending including for new product introductions 

financial products segment 

financial products’ revenues were 3078 billion a decrease of 235 million or 7 percent from 2014 the decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates average earning assets were down in asiapacific latin america and eame partially offset by higher average earning assets in north america average financing rates decreased primarily in north america and eame 

financial products’ profit was 809 million in 2015 compared with 901 million in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to a 68 million decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting changes in the geographic mix of margin and currency impacts and a 55 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets partially offset by a 33 million decrease in the provision for credit losses at cat financial the decrease in provision for credit losses at cat financial was primarily due to a favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate and a favorable impact from changes in portfolio balances partially offset by an increase in writeoffs net of recoveries the favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate was driven by changes in certain assumptions within the allowance for credit loss model during 2015 as a result of managements review the loss emergence period and loss given default assumptions were updated and resulted in a decrease to the allowance for credit losses of 66 million 

at the end of 2015 past dues at cat financial were 214 percent compared with 217 percent at the end of 2014 writeoffs net of recoveries were 155 million for the fullyear 2015 compared with 104 million for the fullyear 2014 the increase in writeoffs net of recoveries was primarily driven by the mining and marine portfolios 

as of december 31 2015 cat financials allowance for credit losses totaled 338 million or 122 percent of net finance receivables compared with 401 million or 136 percent of net finance receivables at yearend 2014 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 3149 billion in 2015 an increase of 258 million from 2014 corporate items and eliminations include corporatelevel expenses restructuring costs timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates and intersegment eliminations 

the increase in expense in 2015 was primarily due to a 467 million increase in restructuring costs and an unfavorable impact from methodology differences partially offset by a favorable impact from timing differences

sales and revenues 

total sales and revenues were 11030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 14244 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 a decline of 3214 billion or 23 percent the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency due to continued strengthening of the us dollar against most currencies with about half of the impact from the euro the two most significant reasons for the decline in sales in 2015 were weakening economic growth primarily in developing countries and substantially lower commodity prices most notably oil while sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in all segments most of the decrease was for new equipment 

sales declined in all regions in north america sales decreased 26 percent due to lower enduser demand primarily in energy  transportation and unfavorable changes in dealer inventories mostly in construction industries in eame sales declined 20 percent mostly due to lower enduser demand for products used in energy  transportation applications and the unfavorable impact of currency as sales in euros translated into fewer us dollars sales decreased 36 percent in latin america primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region which had a negative impact on construction and mining activity and demand for products used in oil and gas applications the most significant decrease was in brazil asiapacific sales declined 16 percent primarily due to lower enduser demand for energy  transportation applications and products used in mining in addition the impact of currency was unfavorable as sales mostly in australian dollars and japanese yen translated into fewer us dollars these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories as dealers reduced inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 

sales decreased in all segments energy  transportation’s sales declined 29 percent as sales decreased due to lower enduser demand and the unfavorable impact of currency construction industries’ sales decreased 18 percent primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 additionally dealer deliveries to end users the impact of currency and price realization were unfavorable resource industries’ sales declined 23 percent mostly due to continued low enduser demand financial products’ segment revenues were down 8 percent primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates 

consolidated operating profit

operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 114 million compared with operating profit of 1063 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 the decrease of 1177 billion was primarily due to lower sales volume reflecting weak market conditions in most of the industries we serve higher restructuring costs and unfavorable price realization these items were partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs and lower sga and rd expenses 

the unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions and an unfavorable geographic mix of sales 

manufacturing costs were favorable due to lower incentive compensation expense lower spending due to cost reduction efforts and improved material costs partially offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than in the fourth quarter of 2014 

sga and rd expenses were favorable due to lower incentive compensation expense and lower spending due to cost reduction efforts 

although the strong us dollar had a negative impact to our sales our sizable manufacturing presence outside of the united states resulted in a favorable impact to costs and operating profit 

restructuring costs of 682 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce in the fourth quarter of 2014 restructuring costs were 97 million 

other profitloss items 

 

 

the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 also includes a benefit of 77 million related to the decrease from the thirdquarter estimated annual tax rate of 27 percent primarily due to the renewal in the fourth quarter of the us research and development tax credit the provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 also included benefits of 85 million related to a decrease from the thirdquarter estimated annual effective tax rate and the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a nonus subsidiary

the sales decrease was primarily due to lower enduser demand across all regions this was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories primarily in asiapacific as dealer inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a decline in the fourth quarter of 2014 

commodity prices remained weak and mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they have for several years as a result sales and new orders in resource industries continue to be weak 

resource industries incurred a loss of 105 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with profit of 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 the unfavorable change was primarily the result of lower sales volume partially offset by improved manufacturing costs 

manufacturing costs were favorable due to lower period costs resulting from cost reduction efforts and improved material costs 

sga and rd expenses were about flat as higher spending for new product introductions was about offset by lower sga expenses 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 4419 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 a decrease of 1772 billion or 29 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014 the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency mostly from the euro sales decreased in all applications

the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2013  at left and 2014  at right items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the companys board of directors and employees 

  

total sales and revenues were 55184 billion in 2014 down 472 million or 1 percent from 2013 sales volume decreased 680 million primarily due to lower volume in resource industries partially offset by higher volume in energy  transportation and construction industries in addition the impact of currency was unfavorable 237 million primarily due to the japanese yen and brazilian real these unfavorable items were partially offset by improved price realization of 365 million and an increase in financial products’ revenues of 80 million 

the volume decrease was primarily the result of lower enduser demand for mining equipment in resource industries as customers reduced their capital expenditures this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as dealers decreased inventories about 1 billion in 2014 compared to a decrease of over 3 billion in 2013 in addition enduser demand increased for energy  transportation applications 

dealers are independent and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels in general dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes macroeconomic conditions and other factors delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers 

aftermarket parts sales were about flat as increases in energy  transportation were about offset by declines in resource industries 

sales declines in asiapacific and latin america were nearly offset by increases in north america in asiapacific sales decreased 13 percent as a result of lower enduser demand resulting from weak economic conditions sales were down in each segment across the region sales declined 17 percent in latin america primarily due to lower enduser demand for mining equipment sales increased 12 percent in north america primarily due to higher enduser demand for construction equipment and oil and gas and transportation applications and the favorable impact of dealer inventory changes primarily for construction equipment 

sales were about flat in eame as lower enduser demand for mining equipment was about offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories while sales in eame were about flat sales declines in the cis were about offset by higher construction equipment sales in europe due to weak but improving economic conditions we believe the sales declines in the cis were due to the effects of ongoing political unrest on economic activity in the region 

by segment sales decreases in resource industries were partially offset by increases in energy  transportation and construction industries resource industries’ sales declined 24 percent resulting primarily from weaker demand for mining products partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories energy  transportation’s sales were 8 percent higher with increases in all applications construction industries’ sales increased 4 percent primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories 

  

consolidated operating profit

operating profit for 2014 was 5328 billion compared with 5628 billion for 2013 the decrease was primarily the result of increased sga and rd expenses higher restructuring costs and the absence of a gain related to a settlement in 2013 with the previous owners of caterpillar zhengzhou ltd these unfavorable items were partially offset by improved price realization primarily for construction industries and energy  transportation and lower manufacturing costs 

sga and rd expenses increased 291 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense partially offset by lower retirement benefits costs and decreased program spending we are focusing on developmental activities in the area of data analytics in an effort to enhance customer productivity we believe that should we be successful in developing an automated analytics and diagnostics solution that can be utilized across our product line this will result in a competitive advantage for our company 

our restructuring activities continued in 2014 as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations restructuring costs for 2014 were 441 million and related to a reduction in workforce at our gosselies belgium facility and other actions across the company in 2013 restructuring costs were 200 million 

manufacturing costs improved 104 million primarily due to lower material costs and favorable changes in cost absorption as inventory declined significantly in 2013 as compared to a slight decline in 2014 these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher incentive compensation increased warranty expenses and the absence of lifo inventory decrement benefits of 115 million from 2013 

shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2014 was about 13 billion shortterm incentive compensation expense related to 2013 was about 545 million 

other profitloss items 

 the 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of 23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a nonus subsidiary and a net benefit of 21 million to adjust prior years’ us taxes and interest this compares to benefits in 2013 of 87 million primarily related to the us research and development tax credit that was retroactively extended in 2013 for 2012 and 55 million to adjust us taxes from the prior year 

segment information 



 





construction industries 

construction industries’ sales were 19362 billion in 2014 an increase of 830 million or 4 percent from 2013 the sales increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and the favorable impact of price realization partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency sales of new equipment increased slightly and sales of aftermarket parts were about flat 

 sales increased in north america and eame while sales in asiapacific and latin america were down 

 

 construction industries’ profit was 2207 billion in 2014 compared with 1374 billion in 2013 the increase in profit was primarily due to the favorable impact of currency higher sales volume improved price realization and lower manufacturing costs these favorable items were partially offset by increased sga and rd expenses 

segment profit for 2014 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2014 while segment profit for 2013 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2013 the difference in these fixed exchange rates resulted in a favorable currency impact for the segment 

manufacturing costs improved primarily due to favorable changes in cost absorption resulting from a significantly larger decrease in inventory in 2013 than in 2014 in addition material costs were lower these favorable items were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense 

sga and rd expenses were higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense 

resource industries 

resource industries’ sales were 8921 billion for 2014 a decrease of 2884 billion or 24 percent from 2013 the sales volume decline was primarily due to lower enduser demand across all geographic regions aftermarket part sales also declined as we believe some companies are continuing to extend proactive maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible these declines were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventory while dealers continued to reduce machine inventories worldwide for 2014 the reductions were less significant than in 2013 

customers in most geographic regions continued to reduce spending across the mining industry we believe that mining companies are increasing productivity at existing mines and improving their transportation infrastructure rather than investing in expansions or new mine openings which results in lower demand for our mining products in addition projects started in prior years have led to an increased supply of coal and iron ore which has outpaced demand and contributed to prices moving below investment thresholds for those commodities as a result new orders for mining equipment continued to be weak in 2014 

resource industries’ profit was 404 million for 2014 compared with 1572 billion for 2013 the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume the absence of a 135 million gain related to the settlement with previous owners of caterpillar zhengzhou ltd and unfavorable price realization resulting from a competitive pricing environment these items were partially offset by an improvement in manufacturing costs and benefits from restructuring actions 

the improvement in manufacturing costs was primarily driven by lower material costs and favorable changes in cost absorption cost absorption was favorable due to about flat inventory for 2014 compared with a decrease in inventory for 2013 these favorable items were partially offset by higher warranty expense 

energy  transportation 

energy  transportation’s sales were 21727 billion for 2014 an increase of 1572 billion or 8 percent from 2013 the sales increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in addition the impact of price realization was favorable and sales increased in all applications sales of aftermarket parts also increased

caterpillar sells products that are used in a variety of different oil and gas applications including offshore and land drilling well servicing oil and gas production and gas compression the products we sell to the oil and gas industry include gas turbines and centrifugal natural gas compressors reciprocating engines transmissions and well stimulation pumps about onethird of energy  transportation’s sales in 2014 were related to oil and gas 

 energy  transportation’s profit was 4135 billion for 2014 compared with 3415 billion for 2013 the increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume which included negative product mix due to sales recognition for a large power generation project in eame in addition price realization improved and material costs were lower these favorable items were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense 

financial products segment 

financial products’ revenues were 3313 billion an increase of 89 million or 3 percent from 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher average earning assets  primarily in north america partially offset by a decrease in asiapacific this increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower average financing rates primarily in north america offset by an increase in latin america 

financial products’ profit was 901 million in 2014 compared with 990 million for 2013 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of 72 million in favorable reserve adjustments at caterpillar financial insurance services a 59 million increase in the provision for credit losses at cat financial and a 27 million unfavorable impact on interest rate swap contracts these decreases were partially offset by a 49 million favorable impact from higher average earning assets and a 40 million improvement on net yield on average earning assets 

corporate items and eliminations 

expense for corporate items and eliminations was 2891 billion in 2014 an increase of 702 million from 2013 corporate items and eliminations include corporatelevel expenses restructuring costs timing differences as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis retirement benefit costs other than service cost currency differences for met as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates and intersegment eliminations 

the increase in expense from 2013 was primarily due to timing differences higher restructuring costs the unfavorable impact of currency increased corporate costs the absence of a lifo inventory decrement benefit of 115 million and the absence of a gain on a legal settlement of 68 million from 2013 segment profit for 2014 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2014 while segment profit for 2013 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2013 the difference in actual exchange rates compared with fixed exchange rates is included in corporate items and eliminations and is not reflected in segment profit these unfavorable items were partially offset by decreased retirement benefit costs and other methodology differences 

  

restructuring costs 

restructuring costs for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 908 million 441 million and 200 million respectively the 2015 restructuring costs included 641 million of employee separation costs 127 million of longlived asset impairments and 92 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses and were recognized in other operating income expense in addition in 2015 we incurred costs related to our restructuring programs of 48 million these costs were primarily for accelerated depreciation and inventory writedowns and were recognized primarily in cost of goods sold the 2014 restructuring costs included 382 million of employee separation costs 48 million of longlived asset impairments and 11 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses the 2013 restructuring costs included 151 million of employee separation costs 41 million of longlived asset impairments and 8 million of other costs restructuring costs for 2014 and 2013 were recognized in other operating income expense 

the restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company the restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our gosselies belgium facility the most significant charges in 2013 were for the restructuring of management and support functions and the closure or downsizing of several facilities related to our mining business 

restructuring costs are a reconciling item between segment profit and consolidated profit before taxes 

the following table summarizes the 2014  and 2015  employee separation activity 



  

in december 2013 we announced a restructuring plan for our gosselies belgium facility this restructuring plan was designed to improve the competitiveness of our european manufacturing footprint and achieve competitiveness in our european operations by refocusing our current gosselies operations on final machine assembly test and paint with limited component and fabrication operations this action includes reshaping our supply base for more efficient sourcing improving factory efficiencies and workforce reductions and was approved by the belgian minister of employment in february 2014 in 2014 we recognized 273 million of these separationrelated charges in 2015 we recognized 24 million of employee separation costs relating to this restructuring plan we do not expect any further costs associated with this program 

in september 2015 we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions as part of that announcement we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying us employees various voluntary separation programs outside of the us and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company we have eliminated approximately 5000 positions since then with about 3000 employees separated by december 31 2015 and the other 2100 employees electing to take the voluntary retirement enhancement program in the us and leave the company january 1 2016 we incurred 379 million of employee separation costs and 86 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program are included in the liability balance above and will be paid in the first quarter of 2016 the remaining liability balance as of december 31 2015  represents costs for other employee separation programs most of which are expected to be paid in 2016  

  

the remaining restructuring costs incurred during 2015 were primarily related to closure and consolidation of numerous manufacturing facilities throughout the company 

additional restructuring actions are being contemplated including the consolidation and closures of manufacturing facilities occurring through 2018 in total we expect the cost of these restructuring actions in 2016 to be about 400 million we expect that restructuring actions will result in a benefit to operating costs primarily sga expenses and cost of goods sold of about 700 million in 2016

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sources of funds 

  

we generate significant capital resources from operating activities which are the primary source of funding for our machinery energy  transportation operations funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and longterm debt issuances financial products operations are funded primarily from commercial paper term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio despite weaknesses in many of the industries we serve we had solid operating cash flow in 2015 on a consolidated basis we ended 2015 with 646 billion of cash a decrease of 881 million from yearend 2014 we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately 53 billion held by our nonus subsidiaries amounts held by nonus subsidiaries are available for general corporate use however if all of the cash held by nonus subsidiaries were repatriated to the united states a portion would be subject to additional us tax 

  

consolidated operating cash flow for 2015 was 668 billion down from 806 billion in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2015 which included lower accruals for shortterm incentive compensation payments in addition unfavorable changes to accounts payable primarily due to decreased material purchases as well as higher shortterm incentive compensation payments in 2015 unfavorably impacted operating cash flow partially offsetting these items were favorable changes to inventory and receivables see further discussion of operating cash flow under machinery energy  transportation and financial products 

total debt as of december 31 2015 was 3809 billion a decrease of 119 billion from yearend 2014 debt related to financial products decreased 710 million reflecting decreasing portfolio funding requirements debt related to machinery energy  transportation decreased 482 million in 2015 primarily due to the maturity of a longterm debt issuance 

  

we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling 1050 billion credit facility available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes based on managements allocation decision which can be 

revised from time to time the portion of the credit facility available to machinery energy  transportation as of december 31 2015 was 275 billion our three global credit facilities are 

 

at december 31 2015 caterpillars consolidated net worth was 1992 billion which was above the 900 billion required under the credit facility consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

at december 31 2015 cat financials covenant interest coverage ratio was 205 to 1 this is above the 115 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as 1 profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to 2 interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended required by the credit facility 

in addition at december 31 2015 cat financials sixmonth covenant leverage ratio was 749 to 1 and yearend covenant leverage ratio was 793 to 1 this is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 required by the credit facility 

in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants additionally in such event certain of cat financials other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may at their election choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2015 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31 2015  were 



  

the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31 2015  totaled 375 billion these committed and uncommitted credit lines which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines 

  

in the event that caterpillar or cat financial or any of their debt securities experiences a credit rating downgrade it would likely result in an increase in our borrowing costs and make access to certain credit markets more difficult in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable our machinery energy  transportation operations would rely on cash flow from operations use of existing cash balances borrowings from cat financial and access to our credit facility our financial products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio existing cash balances access to our credit facility and other credit line facilities of cat financial and potential borrowings from caterpillar in addition we 

maintain a support agreement with cat financial which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may under certain circumstances require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios 

machinery energy  transportation 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 518 billion in 2015 compared with 747 billion in 2014 the decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2015 which included lower accruals for shortterm incentive compensation payments in addition unfavorable changes to accounts payable primarily due to decreased material purchases as well as higher shortterm incentive compensation payments in 2015 unfavorably impacted operating cash flow partially offsetting these items were favorable changes to inventory inventory decreased in 2015 to a greater degree than the inventory reductions in 2014 we are anticipating that lower sales and our ongoing focus on operational improvements will result in some reduction in inventory in 2016 

net cash used for investing activities in 2015 was 178 billion compared with 141 billion in 2014 the increase was due to higher spending related to investments and acquisitions in 2015 

net cash used for financing activities in both 2015 and 2014 was 424 billion 2015 financing activities were primarily due to the repurchase of caterpillar common stock dividend payments and payments on longterm debt 2014 financing activities were primarily due to the repurchase of caterpillar common stock and dividend payments partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt 

  

our priorities for the use of cash are to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating provide capital to support growth appropriately fund employee benefit plans pay dividends and repurchase common stock 

  

strong financial position   —  a key measure of machinery energy  transportations financial strength used by both management and our credit rating agencies is machinery energy  transportations debttocapital ratio debttocapital is defined as shortterm borrowings longterm debt due within one year and longterm debt due after one year debt divided by the sum of debt and stockholders equity debt also includes machinery energy  transportation borrowings from financial products the debttocapital ratio for machinery energy  transportation was 391 percent at december 31 2015 within our target range of 30 to 45 percent the machinery energy  transportations debttocapital ratio was 374 percent at december 31 2014 the increase was primarily due to a return of capital to stockholders of 38 billion 20 billion stock repurchase and 18 billion dividends and unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment to equity of 10 billion these items were partially offset by profit 

  

capital to support growth   —  capital expenditures during 2015 were 163 billion we expect machinery energy  transportation capital expenditures in 2016 to be lower than 2015 

  

appropriately funded employee benefit plans   —  during 2015 we made contributions of 30 million to our us defined benefit pension plans and 156 million to our nonus pension plans we made contributions of 255 million to our us defined benefit pension plans and 265 million to our nonus pension plans in 2014 we expect to make approximately 150 million of required contributions in 2016 we believe we have adequate liquidity resources to fund both us and nonus pension plans 

  

paying dividends   —  dividends paid totaled 176 billion in 2015 representing 70 cents per share paid in the first and second quarters and 77 cents per share in the third and fourth quarters each quarter our board of directors reviews the companys dividend for the applicable quarter the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook corporate cash flow the companys liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend 

  

common stock repurchases   —  in january 2014 the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of caterpillar common stock the 2014 authorization which will expire on december 31 2018 as of january 1 2015 750 billion remained available under the 2014 authorization in 2015 we repurchased 203 billion of caterpillar common stock leaving approximately 547 billion available under the 2014 authorization caterpillars basic shares outstanding as of december 31 2015 were 582 million 

  

financial products 

  

financial products operating cash flow was 139 billion in 2015 compared with 143 billion in 2014 net cash used for investing activities in 2015 was 102 billion compared with 258 billion in 2014 the change was primarily due to lower levels of financing net cash used by financing activities in 2015 was 228 million compared with 770 million net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 the change was primarily due to lower funding requirements for investing activities 



contractual obligations 

  

the company has committed cash outflow related to longterm debt operating lease agreements postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations interest on longterm debt and other longterm contractual obligations minimum payments for these obligations are 

  



  

 

the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits was 968 million at december 31 2015 payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements these obligations are not included in the table above we do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets fair values for goodwill impairment tests impairment of availableforsale securities warranty liability stockbased compensation reserves for product liability and insurance losses postretirement benefits postsale discounts credit losses and income taxes we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments these assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each 

  

residual values for leased assets  – the residual values for cat financial’s leased assets which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action at the inception of the lease residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors market size and demand any known significant marketproduct trends total expected hours of usage machine configuration application location model changes quantities and past remarketing experience thirdparty residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation the lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for noncompliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return model changes and updates as well as market strength and product acceptance are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure 

during the term of the leases residual values are monitored if estimated endofterm market values of leased equipment reflect a nontemporary impairment due to economic factors obsolescence or other adverse circumstances the residual value of the leased equipment is adjusted so that the carrying value at end of lease term will approximate the estimated endofterm market value for equipment on operating leases adjustments are made on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the lease through depreciation expense for finance leases adjustments are recognized at the time of assessment through a reduction of finance revenue 

at december 31 2015 the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was 209 billion without consideration of other factors such as thirdparty residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options a 10 nontemporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately 80 million of additional annual depreciation expense 

fair values for goodwill impairment tests – we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a twostep process if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting units where we perform the twostep process the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required in step two the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 

the impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a yearfive residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity the income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the companys market capitalization the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units longterm forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management a reporting unit’s discount rate is a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from a market participants perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing and capital expenditures 

annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value including goodwill except as noted in the following paragraph caterpillars market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the company 

our resource industries segment has two reporting units with goodwill largely from our acquisition of bucyrus international inc in 2011 hauling  extraction with goodwill of approximately 17 billion and material handling  underground with goodwill of approximately 19 billion hauling  extraction’s product portfolio primarily includes large mining trucks electric rope shovels draglines hydraulic shovels offhighway trucks wheel tractor scrapers and related parts material handling  underground’s product portfolio primarily includes large tracktype tractors hard rock vehicles longwall miners track and rotary drills highwall miners large wheel loaders articulated trucks wheel dozers scoops and haulers continuous miners hardrock continuous mining systems and related parts our equipment is used to extract and haul copper iron ore coal oil sands aggregates 

gold and other minerals and ores the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices although the impact may vary by reporting unit weakness in current economic conditions and in the mining industry have caused the october 1 2015 fair values of these two reporting units to decline from previous periods as our future cash flow forecasts and growth rates have been reduced we expect resource industries sales to decline about 15 to 20 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of continuing reductions in miningrelated commodity prices and difficult financial conditions for many mining customers around the world we expect resource industries sales and cash flows to improve over the remainder of the five year forecast period based on our estimates for longterm growth profits and cash flows the fair values of both hauling  extraction and material handling  underground have remained greater than their respective carrying values the fair value of the hauling  extraction reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15 percent the fair value of material handling  underground remains substantially above its carrying value 

an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units particularly longterm growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting units the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process a goodwill impairment would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

impairment of availableforsale securities  –   availableforsale securities primarily at insurance services are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value 

  

for debt securities once a security’s fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred these reviews which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed otherthantemporarily impaired at any time once a security’s fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months the security will be otherthantemporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise 

  

for equity securities in a loss position determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired requires an analysis of that securitys historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return this information is utilized to estimate a security’s future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates 

for both debt and equity securities qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired these include reviews of the following significant changes in the regulatory economic or technological environment of the investee significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

  

warranty liability  – at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine modelengine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates 

  

stockbased compensation  – we use a latticebased optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and sars the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the latticebased optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following 

  

 54 

options on caterpillar stock the implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense 

   

the fair value of our rsus and prsus is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period the estimated dividends are based on caterpillar’s quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant a decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense 

  

stockbased compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest in determining the stockbased compensation expense to be recognized a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award this rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on caterpillar employee historical behavior changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate a decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense 

  

product liability and insurance loss reserve  – we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported loss reserves including incurred but not reported reserves are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels 

  

postretirement benefits  – primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows 

  

 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses actuarial gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss when the unamortized actuarial gains or losses for an individual plan exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or 10 percent of marketrelated value of plans assets at the beginning of the year the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic benefit 

cost using the straightline method the amortization period is generally the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits from the plan for plans in which all or almost all of the plan’s participants are inactive actuarial gains or losses are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants see retirement benefits section for a discussion of changes in accounting for retirement benefits 

  

postsale discount reserve  – we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user the amount of accrued postsale discounts was 1191 million and 1273 million as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustments have not been material 

  

credit loss reserve   the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management takes into consideration past loss experience known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions 

accounts are identified for individual review based on pastdue status and information available about the customer such as financial statements news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateraldependent receivables in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual thirdparty guarantees the allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment 

while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions there can be no assurance that in the future changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers if the financial health of our customers deteriorates the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore could result in a change to our estimated losses 

income taxes  – we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income taxes we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 

  

despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions settlement of any challenge can result in no change a complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statements a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset we record or adjust the related valuation allowance 

in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes 

  

a provision for us income taxes has not been recorded on undistributed profits of our nonus subsidiaries that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us if management intentions or us tax law changes in the future there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs a deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a us tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future 

income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation that statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate in part due to indefinitely reinvested profits of nonus subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which are generally lower than the us rate of 35 percent the indefinitely reinvested profits of caterpillar sarl csarl primarily taxable in switzerland contribute the most significant amount of this difference on january 30 2015 we received a revenue agents report rar from the internal revenue service irs indicating the end of the field examination of our us income tax returns for 2007 to 2009 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005 the irs has proposed to tax in the united states profits earned from certain parts transactions by csarl based on the irs examination team’s application of “substanceoverform” or “assignmentofincome” judicial doctrines we are vigorously contesting this adjustment through the irs appeals process we believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines the purchase of parts by csarl from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the united states have substantial legal commercial and economic consequences for the parties involved we have filed us income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2009 we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

other matters 

  

environmental and legal matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in accrued expenses we believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required 

on january 8 2015 the company received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of illinois the subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to among other things financial information concerning us and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries including undistributed profits of nonus subsidiaries and the movement of cash among us and nonus subsidiaries the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to among other things the purchase and resale of replacement parts by caterpillar inc and nonus caterpillar subsidiaries dividend distributions of certain nonus caterpillar subsidiaries and caterpillar sarl and related structures the company is cooperating with this investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on september 12 2014 the sec notified the company that it was conducting an informal investigation relating to caterpillar sarl and related structures on december 8 2015 the company was notified by the sec that it concluded its investigation relating to caterpillar sarl and related structures and that it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action 

on september 10 2014 the sec issued to caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the company’s accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of bucyrus international inc in 2011 and related matters the company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation and the company is cooperating with the sec regarding its ongoing investigation the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on march 20 2014 brazil’s administrative council for economic defense cade published a technical opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants including two subsidiaries of caterpillar inc mge  equipamentos e serviços ferroviários ltda mge and caterpillar brasil ltda the publication of the technical opinion opened cades official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in brazil while companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in brazil criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of mge and one former employee of mge involving the same conduct alleged by cade the company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities the company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss however we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on october 24 2013 progress rail received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the central district of california the subpoena requests documents and information from progress rail united industries corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of progress rail and caterpillar inc relating to allegations that progress rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts equipment tools and other items in connection with this subpoena progress rail was informed by the us attorney for the central district of california that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices the company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter although the company believes a loss is probable we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

in addition we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters or intellectual property rights the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

  

retirement benefits 

  

we recognized pension expense of 562 million in 2015 as compared to 465 million in 2014 the increase in expense was primarily due to higher amortization of net actuarial losses primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 reflected in 2015 expense compared to the end of 2013 reflected in 2014 expense and changes to our us mortality assumption in addition the 2015 expense includes 52 million of curtailment expense related to the voluntary retirement enhancement program that was offered in 2015 to qualifying us employees the increase in expense was partially offset by lower interest costs at the end of 2015 total actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for pension plans were 755 billion as compared to 753 billion in 2014 the majority of the actuarial losses are due to changes in discount rates losses from demographic assumptions over the past several years and plan asset losses in the fourth quarter of 2014 the mortality assumption for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was reviewed to consider the use of new tables that were released by the society of actuaries as of december 31 2014 the company adopted the new tables with modifications to reflect historical company specific mortality experience and its best estimate of future mortality improvements the adoption of the new tables resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately 400 million 

in 2015 we recognized other postretirement benefit expense of 259 million compared to 227 million in 2014 the increase in expense was primarily due to 34 million of curtailment expense related to the us voluntary retirement enhancement program at the end of 2015 total actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for other postretirement benefit plans were 171 million as compared to 800 million in 2014 these losses mainly reflect the impact of discount rates changes in our health care trend assumption and plan asset losses partially offset by gains from lower than expected health care 

costs the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily the result of gains from lower than expected health care costs increase in the discount rates and amortization of net actuarial losses into earnings during 2015 

at december 31 2015 we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost historically these components were determined utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in 2016 we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows we have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve compared to the method used in 2015 we expect this change to result in lower pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately 180 million in 2016 before considering the change in accounting principle discussed in the paragraph below this change will have no impact on pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and will be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

at january 1 2016 we changed our accounting principle for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to a more preferable policy under us gaap prior to 2016 actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and were generally amortized into earnings in future periods under the new principle actuarial gains and losses will be immediately recognized through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement in addition we changed our policy for recognizing expected returns on plan assets from a marketrelated value method based on a threeyear smoothing of asset returns to a fair value method we believe that these changes are preferable as they provide greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better align with the fair value accounting principles by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred these changes will be applied retrospectively to prior years we are currently determining the impact on prior years and will provide that information later in 2016 excluding any gains or losses from remeasurement we currently estimate this change will reduce our 2016 pension and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately 425 million and the estimated impact on 2015 is a reduction in expense of approximately 575 million as the change to the use of specific spot rates for calculating the service and interest cost component of our pension and other postretirement benefit cost does not impact the measurement of benefit liabilities the related change in service and interest costs will be offset in the gains or losses reported when benefit plans are remeasured 

prior to making these changes we would have expected our total pension and other postretirement benefit expense to decrease approximately 230 million in 2016 which would have been primarily due to a decrease in amortization of net actuarial losses 

in general our strategy for both the us and the nonus pensions includes further aligning our investments to our liabilities while reducing risk in our portfolio for our us pension plans our yearend 2015 asset allocation was 46 percent equity securities 51 percent fixed income securities and 3 percent other our current us pension target asset allocations is 45 percent equity and 55 percent fixed income the target allocations will be revisited periodically to ensure that they reflect our overall objectives the us plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis 

the yearend 2015 asset allocation for our nonus pension plans was 41 percent equity securities 52 percent fixed income securities 4 percent real estate and 3 percent other the 2015 target allocation for our nonus pension plans was 41 percent equity securities 51 percent fixed income securities 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements demographics of the plan participants and funded status the frequency of rebalancing for the nonus plans varies depending on the plan 

the use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives the plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes 

  

during 2015 we made contributions of 30 million to our us defined benefit pension plans and 156 million to our nonus pension plans we made contributions of 255 million to our us defined benefit pension plans and 265 million to our nonus pension plans in 2014 we expect to make approximately 150 million of required contributions in 2016 we believe we have adequate liquidity resources to fund both us and nonus pension plans 

  

actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and other postretirement benefit expenses the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2015 benefit costs and yearend obligations are included in the table below 



postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity 

  

following are the effects of a one percentagepoint change in our primary pension and other postretirement benefit actuarial assumptions included in the following table on 2015  pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 

  

  



sensitivity 

  

foreign exchange rate sensitivity 

  

machinery energy  transportation use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the us dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five 

years based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery energy  transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at yearend a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2016  cash flow for our machinery energy  transportation operations by approximately 318 million last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 362 million adverse impact on 2015  cash flow we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity 

  

since our policy for financial products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 

the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar in reality some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movements in the chinese yuan euro japanese yen australian dollar and british pound 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

for our machinery energy  transportation operations we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixedtofloating interest rate swaps to fixedrate debt and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2016  pretax earnings of machinery energy  transportation last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2015 pretax earnings 

  

for our financial products operations we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our matchfunding objectives and strategies we have a matchfunding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio finance receivables and operating leases within certain parameters in connection with that policy we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads regardless of the direction interest rates move 

  

in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings all onbalance sheet positions including derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant an analysis of the december 31 2015  balance sheet using these assumptions estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential 13 million adverse impact on pretax earnings last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential 5 million adverse impact to 2015  pretax earnings 

  

this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates accordingly no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate 

nongaap financial measures 

the following definitions are provided for the nongaap financial measures used in this report these nongaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 

we have incurred significant restructuring costs in 2015 we believe it is important to separately quantify the profitpershare impact of restructuring costs in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers as these costs are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits we have also provided 2014 profit per share excluding restructuring costs comparable to the 2015 presentation reconciliation of profit per share excluding restructuring costs to the most directly comparable gaap measure profit per share  diluted is as follows 



supplemental consolidating data 

  

we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis the data has been grouped as follows 

  

consolidated – caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries 

  

machinery energy  transportation – caterpillar defines machinery energy  transportation as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries with financial products accounted for on the equity basis machinery energy  transportation information relates to our design manufacturing marketing and parts distribution operations financial products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment the nature of these businesses is different especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences we also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business 

  

financial products –  our finance and insurance subsidiaries primarily cat financial and insurance services

general 

  

originally organized as caterpillar tractor co in 1925 in the state of california our company was reorganized as caterpillar inc in 1986 in the state of delaware as used herein the term “caterpillar” “we” “us” “our” or “the company” refers to caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise 

  

overview 

  

with 2014 sales and revenues of 55184 billion caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company principally operates through its three product segments  resource industries construction industries and energy  transportation formerly power systems  and also provides financing and related services through its financial products segment caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

currently we have seven operating segments of which four are reportable segments and are described below further information about our reportable segments including geographic information appears in note 23 — “segment information” of exhibit 13 

  

categories of business organization 

  

1     machinery energy  transportation  — represents the aggregate total of construction industries resource industries energy  transportation and all other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations 

  

2     financial products  — primarily includes the company’s financial products segment this category includes caterpillar financial services corporation cat financial caterpillar financial insurance services insurance services and their respective subsidiaries 

  

other information about our operations in 2014 including certain risks associated with our operations is incorporated by reference from our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 13 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction general construction rental mining and quarry and aggregates markets 

  

customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine in response to increased demand in developing economies caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies in those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements we continued our multiyear roll out of products designed to meet those requirements the majority of construction industries research and development spending in 2014 focused on tier 4 final compliance we believe that these products have been wellreceived by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh industrial nv deere  company hitachi construction machinery co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai construction equipment part of hyundai heavy industries as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xiamen xgma machinery co ltd xcmg group the shandong heavy industry group co ltd shantui construction machinery co ltd strong construction machinery co ltd and 

shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications as a result of the acquisition of bucyrus international inc bucyrus in july 2011 caterpillar is able to offer mining customers the broadest product range in the industry in 2014 resource industries substantially completed a three year transition of the former bucyrus distribution business to the independent caterpillar dealers who support mining customers prior to 2014 the resource industries segment also served forestry paving and industrial and waste customers due to an internal reorganization these products were reorganized out of resource industries effective january 1 2014 and are now included in the all other operating segments 

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products applications and regional markets our global competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment part of volvo group atlas copco and sandvik mining a number of chinese companies are active in the midtier market including guangxi liugong machinery co ltd xcmg group and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd 

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



  

energy  transportation 

  

our energy  transportation segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines turbines dieselelectric locomotives integrated systems and solutions and related parts across industries serving oil and gas power generation industrial and marine applications as well as railrelated businesses energy  transportation remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years this new product introduction process is the most extensive in our history we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine oil and gas industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application 

principal global competitors include cummins inc rollsroyce power system ag formerly tognum ag ge oil  gas ge power  water deutz ag and wartsila corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se siemens power  gas rollsroyce marine mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co aggreko plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens ag and alstom transport and voestalpine ag we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions 

the energy  transportation product portfolio includes the following 

 

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm trade receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america cat financial also has offices and subsidiaries in asiapacific europe and latin america 

  

for over 30 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 52 percent include 

  

 

 

 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 15 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 33 percent include 

  

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2014 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of exhibit 13 

 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factors on pages 8 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies substantially all such foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts are undesignated 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and intended use of equipment cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

order backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 173 billion at december 31 2014 and 180 billion at december 31 2013 compared to yearend 2013 the order backlog declined about 700 million decreases in resource industries were partially offset by increases in energy  transportation in 2013 the order backlog declined significantly for miningrelated products within resource industries and declined slightly for energy  transportation these declines were partially offset by a substantial increase in construction industries of the total backlog at december 31 2014 approximately 30 billion was not expected to be filled in 2015 

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 48 located in the united states and 129 located outside the united states serving 182 countries and operating 3580 places of business including 1267 dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited are also sold through a worldwide network of 103 distributors located in 182 countries some of the electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited formerly known as fg wilson engineering limited are sold through its worldwide network of 264 distributors located in 145 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business some products primarily turbines and locomotives are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate a dealership in japan that covers approximately 85 of the japanese market nippon caterpillar division we are currently operating this japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the all other operating segments there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the 

company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

our products are sold primarily under the brands “caterpillar” “cat” design versions of “cat” and “caterpillar” “electromotive” “fg wilson” “mak” “mwm” “perkins” “progress rail” “sem” and “solar turbines” we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

  

research and development 

  

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2014 2013 and 2012 we spent 2135 million 2046 million and 2466 million or 39 37 and 37 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs research and development expense is expected to increase about 10 percent in 2015 

  

employment 

  

as of december 31 2014 we employed 114233 fulltime persons of whom 63419 were located outside the united states in the united states most of our 50814 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

as of december 31 2014 there were approximately 10400 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions including the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw the international association of machinists and the united steelworkers approximately 7700 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the uaw that expire on march 1 2017 and december 17 2018 outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

  

sales and revenues 

  

sales and revenues outside the united states were 62 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2014 67 percent for 2013 and 69 percent for 2012 

  

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technologies current applicable laws and regulations and prior remediation experience where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs in formulating the estimate of probable costs we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others we reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item accrued expenses in statement 3  consolidated 

financial position at december 31 of exhibit 13 there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all the sites in the aggregate will be required

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of exhibit 13 to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in exhibit 13 include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking 

statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings higher unemployment and lower consumer spending a prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices increases in demand or output in these industries may lead to increases in demand for our products conversely if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products will generally decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions economic growth government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend proactive maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible    

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease inside or outside of the united states demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity price changes component price increases fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures and support growth fund our employee retirement benefit programs pay dividends and buy back stock continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 10 

 

 

   

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

 each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either caterpillar or cat financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor by seeking other funding sources however there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

  

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example certain of cat financial’s activities are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 and is a comprehensive financial reform act that includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry certain aspects of doddfrank remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the sec the united states commodity futures trading commission and federal banking regulators as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs both directly and indirectly through increased costs of doing business with marketing intermediaries that are now subject to extensive regulation pursuant to doddfrank and other regulatory initiatives for example derivatives dealers may seek to pass to us the cost of any margin capital or other regulatory requirements to which they become subject to under doddfrank or other regulatory reforms as the regulatory regime is still developing and the rulemaking process has been progressing slowly the ultimate costs and impact of doddfrank and other regulatory initiatives on cat financial’s business remain uncertain and may not be known for years however such costs could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition additional regulations in the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities 

the risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products 

and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace we compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts changes in our competitors’ behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives 

we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which we expect to have a positive effect on our business competitive position results of operations and financial condition for example we formed the caterpillar enterprise system group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and ordertodelivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements as well as to reduce waste further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers we are also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations there can be no assurance that this erp system these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if our new erp system is not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions 

throughout 2014 we implemented restructuring plans and incurred significant separationrelated charges primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our gosselies belgium facility we expect to take restructuring actions in 2015 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred as a result of these actions we will likely continue to incur charges which may include but not be limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits potential additional pension funding obligations and pension curtailments any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished 

products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand additionally some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources these liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our operations outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations in addition we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws regulations and business practices that differ from those in the united states there is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations violations of anti 

corruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see note 5 income taxes and note 22 environmental and legal matters to our consolidated financial statements in exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10k  we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period 

  

the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time in addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board and the sec the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly reports on form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and we could in the future experience similar attacks however to date no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity while we actively manage information technology security risks within our control there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems networks and data the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war terrorist acts fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction general construction mining and quarry and aggregates markets although the worldwide construction industry in 2013 was depressed from a historical standpoint it showed some signs of improvement as the year progressed and order rates improved construction industries’ sales declined slightly in 2013 from 2012 over half of the sales decrease was due to the unfavorable impact of currency primarily from a weaker japanese yen in addition volume was lower primarily from changes in dealer machine inventory in 2013 our sales declined in eame and asiapacific while north america and latin america were about flat   

  

customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine in response to increased demand in developing economies caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies in those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements we continued our multiyear roll out of products designed to meet those requirements we believe that these products have been wellreceived by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage 

  

in order to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand we began production in 2013 at our rayong thailand and athens georgia usa facilities given the uncertainty in the global economy we slowed other capacity increases and reduced production rates at several facilities during 2013 we also conducted targeted marketing programs to reduce inventory in certain markets including china 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh global industrial nv deere  company hitachi construction machinery co ltd jc bamford excavators ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai construction equipment part of hyundai heavy industries as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include guangxi liugong machinery co ltd longking holdings ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xiamen xgma machinery co ltd xcmg group the shandong heavy industry group co ltd shantui construction machinery co ltd strong construction machinery co ltd and shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications as a result of the acquisition of bucyrus international inc bucyrus in july 2011 caterpillar is able to offer mining customers the broadest product range in the industry resource industries continues to transition the former bucyrus distribution business to the independent caterpillar dealers who support mining customers with nineteen dealer transactions completed during the year in 2013 resource industries also served forestry paving tunneling industrial and waste customers due to an internal reorganization these products were reorganized out of resource industries effective january 1 2014 and is now included in the all other operating segments 

resource industries sales declined significantly in 2013 almost all from lower sales volume attributable to declines in dealer inventories and lower enduser demand although production of most mined commodities is near or above a year ago mining customers in all geographic regions reduced capital spending which resulted in lower demand for our mining products dealers also reduced machine inventories during the year to better align their inventory levels with expected demand cost management was a key element of resource industries’ strategy in 2013 the significant decline in sales resulted in substantial actions to lower production cost and employment actions taken during the year included temporary plant shutdowns global workforce reductions temporary layoffs of salaried and management employees reductions in program and discretionary spending and substantially lower incentive pay in order to be wellpositioned when the mining industry improves we are continuing our efforts to reduce costs but are not expecting to make substantial changes in physical capacity 

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products applications and regional markets our global competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment part of volvo group atlas copco sandvik mining wirtgen and deere  co a number of chinese companies are active in the midtier market including liugong machinery co ltd xcmg group and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd 

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



  

power systems 

  

our power systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power industrial petroleum and marine applications as well as railrelated businesses 

  

in september 2013 we acquired johan walter berg ab berg berg is a leading manufacturer of mechanically and electrically driven propulsion systems and marine controls for ships headquartered in Öckerö islands sweden berg has designed and manufactured heavyduty marine thrusters and controllable pitch propellers since 1929 its proprietary systems are employed in maritime applications throughout the world that require precise maneuvering and positioning with the acquisition caterpillar will transition from selling only engines and generators to providing complete marine propulsion package systems   sales of engines decreased in 2013 primarily due to lower volume in electric power petroleum and rail applications power systems remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years this new product introduction process is the most extensive in our history we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc rollsroyce power system ag formerly tognum ag ge oil  gas ge power  water deutz ag and wartsila corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se siemens energy rollsroyce energy rollsroyce marine mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co aggreko plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens ag and alstom transport and voestalpine ag we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions 

the power systems product portfolio includes the following 

 

  

  

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america cat financial also has additional offices and subsidiaries in asiapacific europe and latin america 

  

for over 30 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 53 percent include 

  

 

 

 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 14 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 33 percent include 

  

   

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2013 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of exhibit 13 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various other banks and finance companies in 

addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factors on pages 9 through 19 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies substantially all such foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts are undesignated 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and intended use of equipment cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

raw materials and component products 

  

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made either to caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

  

order backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 180 billion 202 billion and 298 billion at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the order backlog declined significantly for miningrelated products within resource industries and declined slightly for power systems these declines were partially offset by a substantial increase in construction industries in 2012 the decline occurred in construction industries resource industries and power systems with 

the most significant decrease in resource industries although dealer deliveries to end users were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 cat dealers lowered their order rates well below enduser demand to reduce their inventories of the total backlog approximately 30 billion 45 billion and 40 billion at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively was not expected to be filled in the following year 

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 48 located in the united states and 130 located outside the united states serving 182 countries and operating 3454 places of business including 1202 dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary perkins engines company limited perkins are also sold through its worldwide network of 100 distributors located in 180 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary caterpillar northern ireland limited formerly known as fg wilson engineering limited are sold through its worldwide network of 264 distributors located in 145 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business turbines locomotives and certain global mining products are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

while the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated we own and operate three dealerships in japan caterpillar east japan ltd caterpillar west japan ltd and caterpillar tohoku ltd cat tohoku in the north we are currently operating these japanese dealers directly and their results are reported in the construction industries segment there are also three independent dealers in the southern region of japan 

  

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request

risk factors 

tableend   

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of exhibit 13 to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k including in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in exhibit 13 include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and in the particular industries we serve the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment a prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and 

countries experiencing economic growth and investment a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices increases in demand or output in these industries may lead to increases in demand for our products conversely if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products will generally decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease inside or outside of the united states demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity price changes component price increases fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively 

impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures and support growth fund our employee retirement benefit programs pay dividends and buy back stock continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

   

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

  

 each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on each of caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting there can be no assurance that caterpillar or cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either caterpillar or cat financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity 

competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for cat financial or an available source of shortterm financing for caterpillar an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to insurance services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the 

customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

  

new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

cat financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business in the us for example cat financial’s operations are subject to the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry many of the regulations implementing the derivatives provisions of doddfrank became effective in 2013 and additional requirements will become effective in 2014 as such cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs both directly and indirectly through increased costs of doing business with more marketing intermediaries that are now subject to extensive regulation pursuant to doddfrank for example derivatives dealers may seek to pass to us the cost of any margin capital or other regulatory requirements that they are subject to under doddfrank as the regulatory regime is still developing and important additional regulations have yet to be adopted the ultimate costs of doddfrank on cat financial’s business remain uncertain however such costs could be significant   and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition additional regulations in the us or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities 

the risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 13 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time including the ongoing divestiture of the bucyrus distribution business to our independent dealers in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including epa tier 4 interim and tier 4 final diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards in the eu israel japan and canada tier 4 or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts changes in our competitors’ behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives 

we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which we expect to have a positive effect on our business competitive position results of operations and financial condition for example we formed the caterpillar enterprise system group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and ordertodelivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements as well as to reduce waste further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers we are also in the process of implementing a new operating system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations there can be no assurance that this operating system these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if our new operating system is not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position 

we could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions 

in december 2013 we announced a restructuring plan for our gosselies belgium operations in order to improve the competitiveness of our european manufacturing footprint we expect to incur significant separationrelated charges in connection with this restructuring plan throughout 2014 which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred in addition we expect to take additional restructuring actions in 2014 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation as a result of these actions we may incur additional charges including but not limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits potential additional pension funding obligations and pension curtailments any of which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition liquidity results of operations and cash flows 

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand additionally some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment 

and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources these liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations in addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the united states and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance national state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to criminal and civil sanctions we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations in addition we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws regulations and business practices that differ from those in the united states there is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees by intermediaries acting on our behalf or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as changes in tax laws and regulations we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities the results of audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows while the use of currency 

hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates in addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

  

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

the potential for governmentmandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing mandatory legislative regulatory andor policybased constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions for example the epa has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavyduty onhighway diesel vehicles which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources although various attempts to pass comprehensive legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the united states the epa has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law the final details and scope of these various legislative regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain so we cannot fully predict the impact on us however should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board and the sec market conditions have prompted these organizations to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly reports on form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

  

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting materially sensitive data or controlling materially sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information 

or systems the compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

general 

  

originally organized as caterpillar tractor co in 1925 in the state of california our company was reorganized as caterpillar inc in 1986 in the state of delaware as used herein the term “caterpillar” “we” “us” “our” or “the company” refers to caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise 

  

overview 

  

with 2012 sales and revenues of 65875 billion caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company is also a leading services provider through caterpillar financial services corporation cat financial caterpillar remanufacturing services and progress rail services corporation progress rail caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

in 2010 we announced a revised strategy and reorganization of our business into strategic business units currently we have five operating segments of which four are reportable segments and are described below further information about our reportable segments including geographic information appears in note 22 — “segment information” of exhibit 13 

  

categories of business organization

other information about our operations in 2012 including certain risks associated with our operations is incorporated by reference from our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 13 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction general construction mining and quarry and aggregates markets after a strong start for our sales of construction machinery in 2012 uncertainties in the global economy had a moderating impact on customer demand dealer deliveries to end users were higher compared with 2011 but dealers began reducing their inventory in the second half of 2012 to align their inventory with enduser demand as a result our sales of construction machinery declined slightly when compared with 2011 although our sales were higher in north america lower sales in other regions including asiapacific more than offset these increases 

customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine in response to increased demand in developing economies caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies in those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements we continued our multiyear roll out of products designed to meet those requirements we believe that these products have been wellreceived by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage 

  

in response to customer demand and our expectations for industry growth we announced significant investment programs in 2010 and 2011 to increase our production of construction machinery especially in the united states brazil and asia these investments are designed to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand in august 2012 we began production of hydraulic excavators at a new facility in victoria texas that will triple our us production capacity for these machines when operating at full capacity in light of global economic uncertainty and lower customer demand we slowed 

other capacity increases and reduced production rates at several facilities we also conducted targeted marketing programs to reduce inventory in certain markets including china 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group cnh global nv deere  co hitachi construction machinery co jc bamford ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include liugong machinery co ltd longking group sany heavy industry co ltd xiagong machinery co ltd xcmg group the shandong heavy industry group co ltd shantui construction machinery co ltd strong construction machinery co ltd and shandong jcm construction machinery co ltd and shandong lingong construction machinery co ltd part of volvo group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications it also serves forestry paving tunneling industrial and waste customers our resource industries business was transformed by the acquisition of bucyrus international inc bucyrus in july 2011 and now offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry we subsequently announced our intention to transition the bucyrus distribution business to the independent caterpillar dealers who support mining customers we made significant progress integrating bucyrus in 2012 and are working closely with our dealers to transition the distribution business with twelve dealer transactions completed during the year 

  

over the past two years we have added capacity for mining products to better align production with expected demand as a result of the increase in production capability coupled with our existing mining order backlog sales in 2012 were higher than 2011 however in the second half of the year slow global growth and commodity prices that were off their 2012 highs resulted in some reductions delays and cancellation of orders for mining products we have continued our announced investments in new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities to increase capacity but slowed the pace of these investments we also completed the acquisition of era mining machinery limited including its whollyowned subsidiary zhengzhou siwei mechanical  electrical manufacturing co ltd siwei to pursue opportunities in the chinese midtier market our investments reflect our belief that longterm trends of urbanization and related infrastructure development will support continued longterm mining industry growth 

  

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products andor applications or in regional markets our global competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment part of volvo group atlas copco wirtgen and deere  co a number of chinese companies are active in the midtier market including beijing shougang construction group co ltd chery heavy industry co ltd liugong machinery co ltd sany heavy industry co ltd xcmg group and zhengzhou coal mining machinery group co ltd 

  

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  



  

power systems 

  

our power systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power industrial petroleum and marine applications as well as railrelated businesses power systems sales increased globally in 2012 driven by increased customer demand and included a full year of sales by mwm holding gmbh mwm 

  

the power systems portfolio includes 

   

as in our other segments customer demand for most power systems products and services has increased significantly in the developing world and we have made investments to increase our production in line with regional demand in 2012 we opened a new electromotive diesel inc emd manufacturing facility in sete lagoas brazil in october 2011 we acquired mwm a leading supplier of natural gas and alternativefuel engines in response to increasing customer demand for sustainable power alternatives while sales of engines and turbines for petroleum applications increased in 2012 along with sales of our rail products and services these increases were partially offset by lower sales for industrial and electric power generation excluding mwm in response to lower sales in certain markets we announced reductions in our workforce at certain facilities power systems remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years this new product introduction process is the most extensive in the company’s history we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc tognum ag ge oil  gas ge power  water deutz ag and wartsila corp other competitors such as man diesel  turbo se siemens energy rolls royce group plc mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group weichai power co ltd kirloskar oil engines limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens ag and alstom transport we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions 

  

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america however cat financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in asia australia europe and latin america 

  

for over 30 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 50 percent include 

  

 

 

 

   

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 15 percent include 

  

 

   

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 35 percent include 

  

   

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2012 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of exhibit 13 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various other banks and finance companies in 

addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs funded by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factors on pages 9 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies substantially all such foreign currency forward option and cross currency contracts are undesignated 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and intended use of equipment cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer funds an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit outside the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions

users were higher compared to 2011 cat dealers lowered their order rates well below enduser demand to reduce their inventories in 2011 order backlog increased by approximately 41 billion due to the acquisition of bucyrus the remaining increase for 2011 compared to 2010 year end was primarily due to an increase in volume across most business units of the total backlog approximately 44 billion 40 billion and 28 billion at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively was not expected to be filled in the following year 

dealers and distributors

for caterpillar branded products the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors

employment 

  

as of december 31 2012 we employed 125341 persons of whom 70783 were located outside the united states we build and maintain a productive motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably 

  

in the united states most of our 54558 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

as of december 31 2012 there were 13666 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents 9027 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that expires on march 1 2017 the international association of machinists iam represents 1811 employees under labor agreements that will expire on may 17 2015 and april 30 2018 the united steelworkers usw represents 1213 employees under labor agreements that will expire on april 30 2013 april 30 2015 and august 19 2018

sales and revenues 

  

sales and revenues outside the united states were 69 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2012 70 percent for 2011 and 68 percent for 2010 

  

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines we have made and will continue to make significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are accrued against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 3 — “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

  

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global economy generally and in various capital markets the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment a prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate if demand or output in these industries increases the demand for our products will generally increase likewise if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products will generally decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the united states demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country in which we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition 

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity or component price increases fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs on the other hand if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures and support growth fund our employee retirement benefit programs pay dividends and buy back stock continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

in addition demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations further following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty many financial institutions have revised their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

   

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets 

  

caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in 2009 two of the major credit rating agencies modified their outlook for caterpillar and cat financial also in 2009 one major credit rating agency that had previously rated caterpillar and cat financial slightly higher than the others downgraded its ratings to a comparable level and assigned a stable outlook while the two rating agencies that had modified their outlooks subsequently improved their outlooks to stable there can be no assurance that caterpillar’s or cat financial’s credit ratings andor outlooks will not be lowered in the future 

  

although caterpillar and cat financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including 

restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

during the last global economic downturn financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of cat financials customers and our dealers and suppliers continuing to meet cat financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing if global economic conditions were to deteriorate cat financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business as well as our and cat financials results of operations and financial condition 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financials and our earnings andor cash flow 

  

changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to cat insurances investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

an increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several 

factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows in addition although cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in cat financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financials and our earnings and cash flows 

  

changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial 

  

the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry we continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation as regulators continue to propose adopt and enforce the implementing rules we are also monitoring other us and international initiatives that further regulate the financial services industry while many of the regulations implementing doddfrank have not yet been adopted these and other regulatory initiatives are expected to impose additional reporting capital and other financial requirements that could result in significant costs or restrictions for cat financial or us and have an adverse effect on cat financials and our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures we often compete with others for the same opportunities to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities for example as discussed in note 23 — acquisitions of exhibit 13 we recorded goodwill impairment of 580 million in 2012 related to our acquisition of siwei 

the risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction 

  

in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time including the ongoing divestiture of the bucyrus distribution business to our independent dealers in the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including epa tier 4 interim and tier 4 final diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards in the eu israel japan and canada tier 4 or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors’ behavior could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from capacity expansion projects costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives including the caterpillar production system cps 

  

we are implementing a number of capacity expansion projects to meet expected customer demand and to expand our share of industry sales there can be no assurance that these projects will succeed in meeting customer demand or that the benefits expected from these projects will be realized as anticipated or at all if we overestimate customer demand we may have underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins certain of our competitors have also announced investments to increase capacity industry overcapacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are also actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which have had a positive effect on our business results of operations and financial condition cps is a productivity initiative that aims to improve our ordertodelivery processes and factory efficiency as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers we are also in the process of implementing a new operating and financial reporting system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations and reporting there can be no assurance that these systems and initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if our new operating and reporting system is not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results 

  

our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and sourcing practices both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than desired they may postpone product purchases from us which may negatively impact our results similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand additionally some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the united states and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance national state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the 

office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

  

moreover several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

  

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as changes in tax laws and regulations we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities the results of audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense 

calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

  

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

the potential for governmentmandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing mandatory legislative regulatory andor policybased constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions for example the epa has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavyduty onhighway diesel vehicles which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources although various attempts to pass comprehensive 

legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the united states the epa has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law the final details and scope of these various legislative regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain so we cannot fully predict the impact on us however should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board and the sec market conditions have prompted these organizations to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly reports on form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

  

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to caterpillar the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

legal proceedings

we are involved in unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters or intellectual property rights the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities if any associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material in some cases we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter however there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of caterpillar inc company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 

because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we concluded that as of december 31 2012 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

management has excluded era mining machinery limited including its whollyowned subsidiary zhengzhou siwei mechanical manufacturing co ltd commonly known as siwei from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 because we acquired siwei in may 2012 siwei is a wholly owned subsidiary of caterpillar inc whose total assets and total sales and revenues represent approximately 1 percent and less than 1 percent respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2012

during the last fiscal quarter there has been no significant change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting except as noted below 

  

during 2012 we acquired 100 percent of the equity in siwei as part of the postclosing integration we are engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the company management has excluded the internal controls of siwei from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 for 2012 this exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

originally organized as caterpillar tractor co in 1925 in the state of california our company was reorganized as caterpillar inc in 1986 in the state of delaware as used herein the term “caterpillar” “we” “us” “our” or “the company” refers to caterpillar inc and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise 

  

overview 

  

with 2011 sales and revenues of 60138 billion caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company is also a leading services provider through caterpillar financial services corporation cat financial caterpillar remanufacturing services caterpillar logistics inc cat logistics and progress rail services corporation progress rail caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

in 2010 we announced a revised strategy and reorganization of our business into strategic business units our reorganization was implemented in 2011 and resulted in the creation of seven operating segments of which four are reportable segments and are described below further information about our reportable segments including geographic information appears in note 22 — “segment information” of exhibit 13 

  

categories of business organization 

  

1   machinery and power systems — represents the aggregate total of construction industries resource industries power systems and all other segments and related corporate items and eliminations 

  

2   financial products — primarily includes the company’s financial products segment this category includes cat financial caterpillar insurance holdings inc cat insurance and their respective subsidiaries 

  

other information about our operations in 2011 including certain risks associated with our operations is incorporated by reference from our “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in exhibit 13 

  

construction industries 

  

our construction industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications the majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction general construction mining and quarry and aggregates markets as the global economy has returned to growth demand for construction machinery increased in 2011 over 2010 especially in developing economies where new machine sales were close to or above record levels sales also increased in developed economies driven primarily by the need for customers to upgrade machine fleets and replace older equipment as we continued to ramp up production to meet demand sales of some machines were limited by our capacity 

  

  

customer demand for construction machinery has been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine in response to increased demand in developing economies caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our sem brand machines we believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies 

  

in response to customer demand and our expectations for industry growth we are investing to increase our production of construction machinery especially in the united states brazil and asia these investments are designed to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand in 2011 we announced new facilities in north carolina texas china and thailand we also announced expansions of our existing facilities in arkansas texas brazil and india in addition to capacity constraints for certain machines we experienced some supply chain constraints related to the tsunami and earthquake that struck japan on march 11 2011 our employees worked closely with our suppliers dealers and customers to mitigate the effects of this disaster and almost all negative impacts experienced in the second quarter were recovered in the second half of the year with minimal profit impact 

  

the competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv deere  co hitachi construction machinery co jc bamford ltd doosan infracore co ltd and hyundai as an example of regional and local competitors our competitors in china also include liugong machinery co ltd longking group sany heavy industry co ltd xiagong machinery co ltd and xcmg group each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each has varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the construction industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  

   

  

resource industries 

  

the resource industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications it also serves forestry paving and tunneling customers our resource industries business was transformed by the acquisition of bucyrus international inc bucyrus in july 2011 and now offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry we subsequently announced our intention to transition the bucyrus distribution business to the independent caterpillar dealers who support mining customers we are expediting integration of the acquired company and working closely with our dealers to transition the distribution business 

  

resource industries sales grew significantly in 2011 both with and without the impact of bucyrus as our mining customers responded to attractive commodity prices and an economic environment that favored capital investment for certain products including large mining trucks our sales were constrained by capacity we have announced investments in new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities to increase capacity including in illinois kansas north dakota china india indonesia russia and thailand these investments reflect our belief that longterm trends of urbanization and related infrastructure development will support continued mining industry growth 

  

the competitive environment for resource industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products andor applications or in regional markets our global competitors include komatsu ltd joy global inc hitachi construction machinery co ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab atlas copco wirtgen and deere  co 

  

the resource industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts 

  

   

power systems 

  

our power systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power industrial petroleum and marine applications as well as railrelated businesses power systems sales increased globally in 2011 driven by increased customer demand and included a full year of sales by electromotive diesel inc emd 

  

the power systems portfolio includes 

·   reciprocating engine powered generator sets 

·   integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry 

·   reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and petroleum industries 

·   reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as caterpillar machinery 

·   turbines and turbinerelated services 

·   dieselelectric locomotives and components and other railrelated products and services 

  

as in our other segments customer demand for most power systems products and services has increased significantly in the developing world and we have announced investments to increase our production in line with regional demand in 2011 we announced investments in engine facilities in brazil china and india two new emd manufacturing facilities commenced operations in indiana and mexico and we announced plans to open an emd manufacturing facility in 

  

  

brazil we also see increasing customer demand for sustainable power alternatives and in october 2011 acquired mwm holding gmbh mwm a leading supplier of natural gas and alternativefuel engines power systems is focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers 

  

regulatory emissions standards of the us environmental protection agency epa and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years this new product introduction process is the most extensive in the company’s history we believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance 

  

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include cummins inc tognum ag ge energy infrastructure siemens energy and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems man diesel  turbo se mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group ab kawasaki heavy industries multiple emerging chinese competitors and rolls royce group plc compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels in railrelated businesses our global competitors include ge transportation vossloh ag siemens ag and alstom transport we also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products services andor geographic regions 

  

financial products segment 

  

the business of our financial products segment is primarily conducted by cat financial a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america however cat financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in asia australia europe and latin america 

  

for over 30 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

  

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

  

  

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 50 percent include 

  

·   tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes depending on the characteristics of the lease for tax purposes cat financial is considered the owner of the equipment 14 percent 

  

·   finance nontax leases where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term 20 percent 

  

·   installment sale contracts which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or tradein and structure payments over time 15 percent 

  

·   governmental leasepurchase plans in the us that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified nonfederal government agencies 1 percent 

  

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 18 percent include 

  

·   inventoryrental programs which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new caterpillar inventory and rental fleets 7 percent 

  

·   shortterm receivables we purchase from caterpillar at a discount 11 percent 

  

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 32 percent include 

  

·   loans that allow customers and dealers to use their caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing 

  

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2011 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 6 — “cat financial financing activities” of exhibit 13 

  

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various other banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 — “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factor titled “our financial products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial service industry” for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

  

  

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and equipment application cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

our products are sold primarily under the brands “caterpillar” “cat” design versions of “cat” and “caterpillar” “electromotive” “fg wilson” “mak” “mwm” “olympian” “perkins” “progress rail” “sem” and “solar turbines” we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

  

research and development 

  

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent 2297 million 1905 million and 1421 million or 38 percent 44 percent and 44 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs research and development expense is expected to increase about 15 percent in 2012 primarily related to the introduction of products designed to meet applicable emissions requirements 

  

employment 

  

as of december 31 2011 we employed 125099 persons of whom 71863 were located outside the united states we build and maintain a productive motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably 

  

in the united states most of our 53236 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

  

  

as of december 31 2011 there were 14367 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents 9684 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that expires on march 1 2017 the international association of machinists iam represents 2000 employees under labor agreements that will expire on april 30 2012 and may 17 2015 

  

outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

  

sales 

  

sales outside the united states were 70 percent of consolidated sales for 2011 68 percent for 2010 and 69 percent for 2009 

  

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or global competitive position 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are accrued against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 2 — “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

  

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of exhibit 13 to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10k include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions 

  

forwardlooking statements may include statements relating to future actions prospective products product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies economic conditions potential returns financial condition and financial results such statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected 

  

  

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10q or form 8k 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global economy generally and in various capital markets the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment a prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate if demand or output in these industries increases the demand for our products will generally increase likewise if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products will generally decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the united states demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

  

central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products as a result unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products during the 20082009 global economic downturn we reduced our own production levels and as a result our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products since 2010 we have significantly increased production levels and have announced a number of capacity expansion programs we cannot guarantee that key suppliers will increase production in time to meet growing demand for our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets during the 20082009 global economic downturn financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures fund our employee retirement benefit programs pay dividends and buy back stock continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

in addition the global demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations further following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty many financial institutions have revised their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customers’ liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

  

  

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

·   multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change 

  

·   imposition of currency restrictions restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints 

  

·   imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas 

  

·   national and international conflict including terrorist acts and 

  

·   political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries 

  

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets 

  

caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in 2009 each of the major credit rating agencies either modified their outlook for the company and cat financial or downgraded the rating while the rating agencies subsequently improved their outlooks to stable there can be no assurance that caterpillar’s or cat financial’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future 

  

although the company and cat financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

difficult and volatile market conditions may have an adverse effect upon the financial industry in which cat financial operates cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customer’s management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 

  

changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on cat financial’s and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows in addition because cat financial makes a significant number of loans in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to cat insurance’s investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

  

the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry we continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation as regulators propose adopt and enforce the implementing rules we are also monitoring other us and international initiatives to further regulate the financial services industry if the doddfrank rules as implemented or other laws or regulations impose significant costs or restrictions on the company or cat financial we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

cat financial relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations including commercial paper medium term notes retail notes variable denomination floating rate demand notes assetbacked securitizations and bank loans significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact cat financial’s access to funding increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows a large portion of cat financial’s borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets while cat financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for cat financial should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced cat financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business results of operations and financial condition the extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs would depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of any future market disruptions the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market general credit conditions the volatility of equity and debt markets our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks including 

  

·   market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which could impact cat financial’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

·   the process cat financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of 

  

  

management’s judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments 

  

·   cat financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 

  

·   as cat financial’s counterparties are primarily financial institutions their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility andor disruptions in financial markets 

  

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures including the acquisition of bucyrus we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

  

from time to time we engage in strategic transactions involving risks including the possible failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or realize the expected benefits of such transactions on july 8 2011 we acquired bucyrus and subsequently announced our intention to sell the bucyrus distribution business to caterpillar dealers who support mining customers we are working to integrate the mining businesses of both companies to transition the bucyrus distribution business to our dealers and to realize the benefits of this acquisition we may not receive sufficient proceeds from the sale of the bucyrus distribution business to offset the sales and service revenues we will forego as a result of this transfer even if the mining businesses are successfully integrated and the bucyrus distribution business is successfully transferred to our dealers we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all in addition the integration may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities or competitive responses the risks associated with this acquisition and our other past or future acquisitions include 

  

·   the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture 

  

·   technological and product synergies economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected 

  

·   unforeseen expenses delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approvals or consents 

  

·   the company may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions 

  

·   faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process 

  

·   unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations processes and systems 

  

·   higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems including it systems accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

·   the company may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business 

  

·   higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations and 

  

·   the company may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases 

  

  

many of these factors will be outside of the company’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention 

  

in addition in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

our introduction of tier 4 emissions compliant machines and engines may not be successful 

  

regulatory agencies have adopted new and more stringent emission standards including epa tier 4 interim and tier 4 final nonroad diesel emission requirements and equivalent standards in the eu japan and canada tier 4 the first phase of these standards tier 4 interim applied to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011 we are using certain technology with state of the art integrated systems as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the tier 4 emissions requirements 

  

our plans to meet tier 4 emissions requirements are subject to many variables including the timing of our tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction if we are unable to meet our plans as projected it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position we are incurring research and development costs to design and introduce products to meet tier 4 requirements we are including costs associated with tier 4 development and production in prices of our products the level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors’ behavior could have an adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from capacity expansion projects costreduction initiatives cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives including the caterpillar production system cps 

  

we have announced a number of capacity expansion projects to meet growing demand and to expand our share of industry sales there can be no assurance that the benefits expected from these projects will be realized as anticipated or at all certain of our competitors have also announced investments to increase capacity industry overcapacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are also actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs which have had a positive effect on our business results of operations and financial condition cps is a productivity initiative that aims to improve our ordertodelivery processes and factory efficiency as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers we are also in the process of implementing a new operating and financial reporting system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations and reporting there can be no assurance that these systems and initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated efficiency improvements incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all if our new operating and reporting system is not implemented successfully it could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results 

  

our business is subject to the sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers 

  

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively in particular some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

in particular our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the united states and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance national state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

  

moreover several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

  

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

  

  

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are reported in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support i our commercial paper program and ii general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

union disputes or other employee relations issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates there can be no assurance that any current or future issues 

  

  

with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

  

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

the potential for governmentmandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing mandatory legislative regulatory andor policybased constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions for example the epa has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavyduty onhighway diesel vehicles which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources although various attempts to pass comprehensive legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the united states the epa has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law the final details and scope of these various legislative regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company however should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact the company’s capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board and the sec market conditions have prompted accounting guidance setters to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on form 10k and our quarterly reports on form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting guidance we 

  

  

are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services 

  

we rely upon it systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities and we collect and store sensitive data increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime including advanced persistent threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data a failure of or breach in security could expose the company and our customers dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a15e based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of caterpillar is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we concluded that as of december 31 2011 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

management has excluded bucyrus international inc bucyrus and mwm holding gmbh mwm from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 because we acquired bucyrus in july 2011 and mwm in october 2011 bucyrus and mwm are wholly owned subsidiaries of caterpillar inc whose combined total assets and total revenues represent approximately 17 and 4 respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 

  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm their report appears on page a4 of exhibit 13

in october 2011 we acquired 100 percent of the equity in mwm as part of the postclosing integration we are engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the company management has excluded the internal controls of mwm from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for 2011 this exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the sec that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of consolidation

company strengths 

  

for more than 85 years caterpillar has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent with 2010 sales and revenues of 42588 billion caterpillar is the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines industrial gas turbines and dieselelectric locomotives the company also is a leading services provider through cat financial caterpillar remanufacturing services caterpillar logistics services inc cat logistics and progress rail services corporation progress rail caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world 

  

competitive environment 

  

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

  

outside of the united states certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

  

  

machinery 

  

the competitive environment for caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include but are not limited to komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv deere  co hitachi construction machinery co jcbamford ltd doosan infracore co ltd and liugong construction machinery na llc each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each have varying degrees of regional focus 

  

the world economy started to recover from its worst postwar recession in 2009 and that recovery continued throughout 2010 developing countries had the strongest recoveries which increased the need for construction and commodities end users increased equipment purchases to meet this increased demand and dealers began rebuilding their inventories to support higher deliveries economic recoveries in the developed economies were weak and unemployment remained near record highs most construction continued to decline in developed economies despite weak economic recoveries and construction declines end users purchased more equipment to slow deterioration in their fleets in response dealers added to their inventories worldwide the change in dealer inventory practices and increased deliveries to end users resulted in a significant increase in machine sales volume in 2010 

  

caterpillar’s logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and approximately 50 customers worldwide it competes with global regional and local logistics competitors including companies such as dhl international ceva logistics and kuehne  nagel inc the unit has grown significantly since its inception in 1987 

  

caterpillar also provides railrelated products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary progress rail progress rail is a leading provider of a broad range of products and services to the railroad industry including new and remanufactured locomotives railcar and track products and design and maintenance services it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as ge transportation bombardier siemens and vae nortrak north america inc 

  

engines 

  

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engineturbine manufacturing and packaging environment the company designs manufactures markets and sells diesel heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for caterpillar machinery electric power generation systems locomotives marine petroleum construction industrial agricultural and other applications in addition caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbinerelated services for oil and gas and power generation applications 

  

the global competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors who compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a substantial number of smaller companies who compete in a limitedsize product range geographic region andor application principal global competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc tognum ag ge energy infrastructure siemens energy and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems man diesel se mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group ab kawasaki heavy industries multiple emerging chinese competitors and rolls royce group plc compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels 

  

as previously announced caterpillar no longer provides new engines for trucks and other onhighway original equipment manufacturers oems subject to current us and european emissions regulations caterpillar will continue to service our previous onhighway engine customers through caterpillar and truck oem dealer channels 

  

since the introduction of caterpillar’s acert® technology in 2003 caterpillar has continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging this technology the building blocks for acert technology are flexible and scalable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application caterpillar is adding several new technologies to our portfolio of acert technologies to meet tier 4 interimstage iiib nonroad emissions regulations we believe acert provides caterpillar with a valuable foundation to meet emissions and performance requirements 

  

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with enginesturbines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing 

  

  

more than two million units annually and recycling more than 150 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole

cat financial operates in a highly competitive environment with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere capital corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

  

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

  

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factor titled “risks to financial products line of business” for general risks associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

  

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge 

  

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and equipment application cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing we believe that these marketing programs provide cat financial a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products

dealers and distributors 

  

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network 50 located in the united states and 138 located outside the united states serving 182 countries and operating 3475 places of business including dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins engines company limited perkins are also sold through its worldwide network of 142 distributors located in 183 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by fg wilson engineering limited fg wilson are sold through its worldwide network of 154 distributors located in 179 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries 

  

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business turbines are sold through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

  

the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

  

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

our products are sold primarily under the brands “caterpillar” “cat” design versions of “cat” and “caterpillar” “electromotive” “fg wilson” “mak” “olympian” “perkins” “progress rail” and “solar turbines” we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

  

research and development 

  

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2010 2009 and 2008 we spent 1905 million 1421 million and 1728 million or 45 percent 44 percent and 34 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs rd expense is expected to increase about 20 percent in 2011 primarily related to the rollout of products designed to meet applicable emissions requirements 

  

  

  

  

employment 

  

as of december 31 2010 we employed 104490 persons of whom 57171 were located outside the united states from a global enterprise perspective we believe our relationship with our employees is very good we build and maintain a productive motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably 

  

in the united states most of our 47319 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

  

as of december 31 2010 there were 12496 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents 9423 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that expires on march 1 2011 and that we are currently in the process of renegotiating the international association of machinists represents 1814 employees under labor agreements that will expire on april 30 2012 and may 17 2015 

  

outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

  

sales 

  

sales outside the united states were 68 percent of consolidated sales for 2010 69 percent for 2009 and 67 percent for 2008 

  

environmental matters 

  

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or global competitive position 

  

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 2 — “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

  

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of exhibit 13 to this form 10k in addition the statements in this section include “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the discussion and analysis contained in the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and other items in this form 10k are forwardlooking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in oral presentations to the public or in other materials we issue to the public forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook you can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as “believe” “expect” “estimate” “anticipate” “will be” “should” “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions that identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 

  

in particular these forwardlooking statements include statements relating to future actions prospective products product approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies economic conditions potential returns financial condition and financial results such statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 

  

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you may however consult any related disclosures we make in subsequent form 10q or form 8k filings with the sec 

  

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements you should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties 

  

our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve 

  

our results of operations are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and various capital markets the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment 

  

the energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate if demand or output in these industries increases the demand for our products would likely increase likewise if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products would likely decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth commodity inventories and any disruptions in production we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing the general economic and financial outlooks we disclose each quarter our 

  

  

“outlooks” commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the united states demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  

  

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities interest rate changes also affect customers’ abilities to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

  

economic events have reduced the availability of liquidity to fund investments in many markets that we serve central banks and other policy arms of many countries have implemented various actions to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit the continuing effectiveness of these and related government actions is uncertain and could have an impact on the customers and markets we serve and our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

government policies on taxes and spending affect our business throughout the world government spending finances much infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain both of which influence investment decisions unfavorable developments such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

  

commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers 

  

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products as a result unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products during the global economic downturn we reduced our own production levels and as a result our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products although we monitor the ability of key suppliers to ramp up production in the event that demand continues to grow we cannot guarantee that they will be able to timely increase production to meet our demands a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe our sources of raw materials and component products will generally be sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future however our business results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations 

  

disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers 

  

global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets during the 20082009 global economic downturn financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain of our customers dealers and suppliers although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures buy back stock pay dividends and fund our employee retirement benefit programs continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in many of the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

  

in addition the global demand for our products generally depends on our customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds subject to global economic conditions many of our customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations further following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty many financial institutions have revised their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs the liquidity of our customers may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

  

our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate 

  

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including 

  

·   multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change 

  

·   imposition of currency restrictions restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints 

  

·   imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas 

  

·   national and international conflict including terrorist acts and 

  

·   political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries 

  

the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets 

  

caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in 2009 each of the major credit rating agencies either modified their outlook for the company and cat financial or downgraded the rating while the rating agencies subsequently improved their outlooks to stable there can be no assurance that caterpillar’s or cat financial’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future 

  

although the company and cat financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

our financial products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry 

  

difficult and volatile market conditions may have an adverse effect upon the financial industry in which cat financial operates cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customer’s management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 

  

changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a material adverse effect on cat financial’s and our earnings and cash flows because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows in addition because cat financial makes a significant number of loans in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to cat insurance’s investment activities changes in the 

  

  

equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

  

the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law in july 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry the impact of this legislation remains uncertain as regulators continue to propose and adopt implementing rules if the rules as adopted impose significant costs or restrictions on the company including without limitation costs or restrictions on our or cat financial’s use of derivatives or asset backed securitizations we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

cat financial relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations including commercial paper medium term notes retail notes variable denomination floating rate demand notes assetbacked securitizations and bank loans significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact cat financial’s access to funding increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows a large portion of cat financial’s borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets while cat financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for cat financial should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced cat financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business results of operations and financial condition the extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs would depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of any future market disruptions the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market general credit conditions the volatility of equity and debt markets our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  

market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks including 

  

·   market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which could impact cat financial’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

·   the process cat financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments 

  

·   cat financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 

  

·   as cat financial’s counterparties are primarily financial institutions their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility andor disruptions in financial markets 

  

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures including the recently announced acquisition of bucyrus we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

  

from time to time we engage in strategic transactions involving risks including the possible failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such transactions on november 14 2010 we entered into an agreement to acquire bucyrus subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals if the merger with bucyrus is consummated the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger including the expected synergies and cost savings will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the mining businesses of both companies our management will be required to devote significant attention and resources to this integration process which may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and if implemented ineffectively could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect failure to successfully integrate the operations of the caterpillar and bucyrus mining businesses or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the mining operations of the combined company in addition the integration may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and the diversion of management’s attention and may cause our stock price to decline the risks associated with the bucyrus acquisition and our other past or future acquisitions include 

  

  

·   the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture 

  

·   technological and product synergies economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected 

  

·   unforeseen expenses delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approvals or consents 

  

·   the company may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities 

  

·   faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process 

  

·   unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems 

  

·   the company may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business 

  

·   higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations and 

  

·   the company may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases 

  

many of these factors will be outside of the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy with respect to the bucyrus acquisition specifically it is possible that regulators will impose conditions on required antitrust approvals including by requiring dispositions even if the mining businesses are successfully integrated the combined company may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that the combined company expects these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all if we fail to complete the bucyrus acquisition or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition this could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

  

in addition in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements in connection with the announcement of the bucyrus acquisition we announced that we intend to issue debt and equity securities to fund the acquisition of bucyrus such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures if we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

  

failure to implement the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time these divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses including through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results 

  

international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position 

  

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

  

our introduction of tier 4 emissions compliant machines and engines may not be successful 

  

the epa has adopted new and more stringent emission standards including tier 4 nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011 we previously announced our intent to make our nonroad engines compliant with the new emission standards including the tier 4 emission requirements by the stated deadline we intend to use certain technology with state of the art integrated systems as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the tier 4 emissions requirements 

  

although we are executing comprehensive plans designed to meet tier 4 emissions requirements these plans are subject to many variables including the timing of our tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction if we are unable to meet our plans as projected it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position we are incurring research and development costs to design and introduce products to meet tier 4 requirements we plan to include costs associated with tier 4 development and production in 

  

  

prices of our products the level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position 

  

the success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs 

  

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing  

  

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

  

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors’ behavior could have an adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

  

union disputes or other employee relations issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results  

  

some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates while we do not expect to be impacted by employee relations issues there can be no assurance that future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire including the master collective bargaining agreement with the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers which is scheduled to expire on march 1 2011 if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the implementation of the caterpillar production system cps or other productivity initiatives 

  

cps is a significant productivity initiative that aims to improve our ordertodelivery processes and factory efficiency as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers inability or failure to implement and utilize cps or other productivity initiatives could have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations there can be no assurance that this initiative or others will be beneficial to the extent anticipated or that the estimated cost savings will be realized 

  

our business is subject to the sourcing practices of our dealers and our original equipment manufacturer oem customers 

  

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively in particular some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to 

  

  

outsource engine manufacture in the future decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs 

  

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

  

in particular our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the united states and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance national state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

  

our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including us regulations issued by customs and border protection the bureau of industry and security the office of antiboycott compliance the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws our continued operation and expansion outside the united states including in developing countries could increase the risk of such violations violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 

  

moreover several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the united states although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a usdomiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

  

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

  

currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of 

  

  

currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

  

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

  

restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility 

  

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support i our commercial paper program and ii general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

  

although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

  

in 2008 we received the consent of lenders under certain of our facilities to our lower consolidated net worth of 6087 billion as of december 31 2008 and to cat financial’s lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 097 as of december 31 2008 in consideration of these consents we agreed to increase the upper range of interest rates applicable to amounts that may be drawn by us and cat financial under certain of our facilities 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability 

  

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years we may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

costs associated with lawsuits or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition however we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

  

  

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional material payments which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

national governments or intergovernmental organizations may impose carbon emissions regulations 

  

the potential for governmentmandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing mandatory reductions being considered by many jurisdictions may take the form of new legislation andor regulations for example in the united states the epa has stated that it plans to promulgate regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources as well as stationary sources additionally the american clean energy and security act has passed the us house of representatives and similar legislation has been introduced in the us senate this legislation is also designed to restrict and reduce carbon emissions from us stationary and mobile sources the final details and scope of these legislative and regulatory measures are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company should final legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact the company’s capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

  

changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our financial statements 

  

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which is periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board market conditions have prompted accounting guidance setters to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

unexpected events including natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters pandemic illness equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing additionally we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues or intellectual property rights although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a15e based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of caterpillar is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a15f our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we concluded that as of december 31 2010 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

management has excluded electromotive diesel inc emd from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 because we acquired emd in august 2010 emd is a wholly owned subsidiary of caterpillar inc whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately 2 percent and 1 percent respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm their report appears on page a4 of exhibit 13 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting

company strengths 

caterpillar is the leader in construction and mining equipment and diesel and natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines in our size range the company is also a leading services provider through cat financial caterpillar logistics services inc cat logistics caterpillar remanufacturing services and progress rail services corporation progress rail annual sales and revenues were 32396 billion in 2009 making caterpillar the largest manufacturer in its industry caterpillar is also a leading us exporter through direct sales of certain products and a global network of independent dealers caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world for almost 85 years the caterpillar name has been associated with the highest level of quality products and services more information is available at wwwcatcom

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

 

 

 

 

the competitive environment for caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include but are not limited to komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv deere  co hitachi construction machinery co terex corporation jc bamford ltd jcb and doosan infracore co ltd each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each have varying degrees of regional focus john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co for example has numerous product lines that compete with caterpillar primarily in north america and latin america others like jcb offer a limited range of products that compete globally against caterpillar 

the world economy experienced its worst postwar recession in 2009 causing construction spending to decline in many countries and mining companies to reduce production end users significantly reduced purchases of equipment and dealers reduced their reported inventories by over 33 billion as a result machinery sales volume declined at an unprecedented rate governments responded with large infrastructure programs and central banks reduced interest rates to record lows as a result the world economy began recovering in the third quarter of 2009 and the yearonyear decline in sales volume in the fourth quarter was less than in the prior two quarters 

caterpillar’s logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and 50 other companies worldwide it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as dhl international ceva and united parcel service inc the unit has grown signifcantly since its inception in 1987 

since its acquisition by caterpillar in june 2006 wholly owned subsidiary progress rail has continued its position in north america as a leading provider of a broad range of products based in albertville alabama progress rail is a leading provider of remanufactured locomotive railcar and track products and services to the north american railroad industry the company also has one of the most extensive rail service and supply networks in north america expansion into the railroad aftermarket business is a good fit with our strategic direction and leverages caterpillar’s global remanufacturing capabilities 

 

 

 

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engineturbine manufacturing and packaging environment the company designs manufactures markets and sells diesel heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for caterpillar machinery electric power generation systems locomotives marine petroleum construction industrial agricultural and other applications in addition caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power generation applications 

 

page 2 

 

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few global competitors who compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range andor application principal global competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc mtu friedrichshafen and mtu detroit diesel both are tognum group companies ge energy infrastructure siemens energy and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems man diesel se man turbo mitsubishi heavy industries ltd volvo penta part of volvo group ab kawasaki heavy industries and rolls royce group plc compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels 

as previously announced caterpillar no longer provides new engines to truck and other onhighway original equipment manufacturers oems caterpillar will continue to service our previous onhighway engine customers through caterpillar and truck oem dealer channels 

since the introduction of caterpillar’s acert® technology in 2003 caterpillar has continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging this technology the building blocks for acert technology are flexible and scalable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application caterpillar will add several new technologies to our portfolio of acert technologies to meet upcoming tier 4 interimstage iiib nonroad emissions regulations we believe acert provides caterpillar with a valuable foundation to meet emissions and performance requirements 

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with enginesturbines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 140 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole 

 

 

  

our financial products business is primarily conducted by cat financial cat financial incorporated in delaware is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financial’s primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers around the world retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines in addition cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm dealer receivables from caterpillar and its subsidiaries the various financing plans offered by cat financial are designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financial’s activities is conducted in north america however cat financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in asia australia europe and latin america 

for over 25 years cat financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates contributing to its knowledge of asset values industry trends product structuring and customer needs 

in certain instances cat financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers and investors iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices and vi regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience cat financial’s ability to comply with these governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations 

cat financial’s retail leases and installment sale contracts totaling 60 percent include

cat financial’s wholesale notes receivable finance leases and installment sale contracts totaling 8 percent include 

 

 

 

cat financial’s retail notes receivables 32 percent include 

 

 

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financial’s competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere credit corporation that utilize belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

cat financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

cat financial has a “match funding” policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 see also the risk factor titled “risks to financial products line of business” for general risk associated with our financial products business included in item 1a of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financial’s operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge 

 

 

indicates the percentage of cat financial’s total portfolio at december 31 2009 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financial’s concentration of credit risk please refer to note 8 – “finance receivables” of exhibit 13 

 

page 4 

cat financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other factors the customer’s credit history financial strength and equipment application cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment throughout the world cat financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers under these programs caterpillar or the dealer subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing these marketing programs provide cat financial with a significant competitive advantage in financing caterpillar products transaction processing time and supporting technologies continue to drive cat financial in its efforts to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing efficiencies we believe cat financial’s webbased cat financ express sm transaction processing and information tool currently available in the united states france canada and australia provides cat financial a competitive advantage in those areas cat financ express sm is a webbased tool that provides finance quotes credit decisions and the ability to print the appropriate financial documents for enduser signature all within a reasonably short time frame

business developments in 2009 

economic and market conditions 

our business results of operations and financial condition were materially affected by the conditions in the global economy during 2009 the continuing global economic crisis and the volatility in the credit and capital markets had a significant impact on our 2009 sales and revenues and profitability overall the company’s sales and revenues decreased 37 percent from 2008 and profit in 2009 was down 75 percent from 2008 

in response to the ongoing recession in 2009 we continued executing our “trough” plans which we had commenced implementing in 2008 and taking other actions to deal with the effects of the recession and to reduce costs these actions resulted in fullyear redundancy costs of 075 per share in addition we focused on maintaining solid profitability and cash flow and improving our balance sheet these efforts contributed to our ability to maintain our credit ratings maintain our dividend rate make pension contributions and continue selective investment in new products and capacity 

during the second half of 2009 market conditions in developing economies showed signs of improvement the more developed economies also showed signs of improvement but at a slower pace many countries responded to the recession by adopting various forms of economic stimulus packages including allocations for infrastructure spending a positive factor for sales of our machinery and engines however the economic recovery remained uneven at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010 

financial results and stockholder value 

full year 2009 results marked a significant decline in sales and revenues and profit for caterpillar the company realized 2009 sales and revenues of 32396 billion and profit of 895 million our profit per share in 2009 was 143 including redundancy costs of 075 per share in spite of the severe economic conditions we improved our balance sheet and maintained our dividend rate the company has not resumed its stock repurchase program since temporarily suspending it on january 26 2009

raw materials and component products 

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials rough and finished parts unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made to either caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery 

order backlog 

much of our backlog is in large engines gas turbines and mining products the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 96 billion at december 31 2009 147 billion at december 31 2008 and 178 billion at december 31 2007 of the total backlog approximately 25 billion at december 31 2009 22 billion at december 31 2008 and 25 billion at december 31 2007 was not expected to be filled in the following year the decrease during 2009 reflects the impact of weak global economic conditions and our decision beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009 to allow dealers to cancel orders our backlog is generally highest in the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying trends in our industry 

dealers 

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network  51 located in the united states and 127 located outside the united states serving 182 countries and operating 3518 places of business including dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins engines company limited perkins are also sold through its worldwide network of 129 distributors located in 165 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by fg wilson engineering limited fg wilson are sold through its worldwide network of 157 dealers located in 180 countries some of the large medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the mak brand through a worldwide network of 19 dealers located in 130 countries 

our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business turbines are sold through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the company’s trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the company’s products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the company’s product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request 

 

page 8 

 

  

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

  

patents and trademarks 

our products are sold primarily under the brands “caterpillar” “cat” design versions of “cat” and “caterpillar” “solar turbines” “mak” “perkins” “fg wilson” “olympian” and “progress rail” we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

research and development 

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2009 2008 and 2007 we spent 1421 million 1728 million and 1404 million or 44 percent 34 percent and 31 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs rd expense is expected to increase about 20 percent in 2010 primarily to support product development programs related to the us environmental protection agency epa tier 4 emissions requirements 

employment 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 93813 persons of whom 50562 were located outside the united states from a global enterprise perspective we believe our relationship with our employees is very good we build and maintain a productive motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably 

in the united states most of our 43251 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

as of december 31 2009 there were 9728 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents 7570 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that will expire march 1 2011 the international association of machinists represents 1627 employees under labor agreements that expire on may 23 2010 and april 30 2012 

outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

sales 

sales outside the united states were 69 percent of consolidated sales for 2009 67 percent for 2008 and 63 percent for 2007 

environmental matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or global competitive position 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 2 – “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

 

page 9 

 

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you may however consult any future related disclosures we make on our form 10q or any form 8k report to the sec 

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from expected or past results you should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties 

economic volatility global economic conditions and the economic conditions of industries or markets we serve 

our results of operations are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and various capital markets global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets in some cases the markets have decreased availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers customers dealers and suppliers 

although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures buy back stock pay dividends and fund our employee retirement benefit programs continuing to meet these cash requirements over the longterm will require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in many of the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact the ability of the company to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

the energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these industries if demand or output in these industries increases the demand for our products would likely increase likewise if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products would likely decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth commodity inventories and any disruptions in production we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the us demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

after declining for three years us residential housing starts began a modest recovery in the second quarter of 2009 but remain at historic lows housing permits in the eurozone have continued to decline since late 2006 although uk housing orders increased in the fourth quarter of 2009 the situation has been compounded by a deterioration of mortgage and financial markets and has negatively impacted our sales in north america and europe historically housing starts have been volatile and these downturns could continue or become more severe although the us government and governments of many other countries including countries in europe japan and australia has adopted initiatives to help restore and stabilize mortgage and real estate markets and the economy generally there is no assurance that these measures will achieve the intended effect 

we expect that the developing markets ie africa asiapacific latin america the middle east and russia which accounted for a significant portion of our 2009 sales and revenues will experience growth during 2010 however a slower rate of economic growth in developing markets than anticipated in our outlooks could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition

changes in government monetary and fiscal policies 

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which alter demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affect sales of our products that serve these activities also interest rates affect customers’ abilities to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies 

economic events have reduced the availability of liquidity to fund investments in many markets that we serve central banks and other policy arms of many countries have implemented various actions to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit the continuing effectiveness of these and related government actions is uncertain and could have a material impact on the customers and markets we serve and our business results of operations and financial condition government policies on taxes and spending affect our business throughout the world government spending finances much infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users can retain both of which influence investment decisions developments more unfavorable than anticipated such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

changes in price and significant shortages of component products 

we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products as a result unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products during the global economic downturn we reduced our own production levels and as a result our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products we anticipate significant volume increases in 2010 and are currently reviewing the ability of key suppliers to ramp up production a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe our sources of raw materials and components products will be generally sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future however our business results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations 

in addition global economic conditions and the volatility in the credit and capital markets have caused a significant decline in sales and revenues and restricted access to liquidity and financing for many businesses if these conditions continue or worsen many of our suppliers’ financial viability could be adversely impacted as a result their ability to continue supplying component products for the manufacture of our products could be significantly undermined which in turn could negatively impact our ability to meet our customers’ demand for our products and our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental regulations 

regulatory compliance in general 

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of general nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

 

page 12 

 

 

in particular our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the us and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance national state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

tier 4 emissions requirements 

the epa has adopted new and more stringent emission standards including tier 4 nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011 we previously announced our intent to make our nonroad engines compliant with the new emission standards including the tier 4 emission requirements by the stated deadline we intend to use certain technology with state of the art integrated systems as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the tier 4 emissions requirements 

although we are executing comprehensive plans designed to meet tier 4 emissions requirements these plans are subject to many variables including the timing of our tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction if we are unable to meet our plans as projected it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position we are incurring research and development costs to design products to meet tier 4 requirements we plan to include costs associated with tier 4 development and production in prices of our products the level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position 

regulation of carbon emissions 

the potential for governmentmandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing mandatory reductions being considered by many jurisdictions may take the form of new legislation andor regulations for example in the us the epa has stated that it plans to promulgate regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources as well as stationary sources additionally the american clean energy and security act has passed the us house of representatives and similar legislation has been introduced in the us senate this legislation is also designed to restrict and reduce carbon emissions from us stationary and mobile sources the final details and scope of these legislative and regulatory measures are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company should final legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could have a material impact upon the company’s capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position 

failure to maintain credit ratings 

caterpillar’s and cat financial’s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on caterpillar’s and cat financial’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting on january 26 2009 moody’s investment services moodys changed its outlook for the longterm ratings of the company and cat financial to negative from stable moody’s did not alter the ‘a2’ longterm ratings or the ‘prime1’ shortterm ratings of the two companies on april 21 2009 standard  poor’s ratings services sp revised its outlook for the company and cat financial to negative from stable while affirming the ‘a’ longterm corporate credit rating and ‘a1’ shortterm ratings on the company and its related entities on april 22 2009 fitch ratings which had previously rated caterpillar and cat financial slightly higher than moody’s and sp downgraded the company and cat financial to ‘a’ from ‘a’ and assigned a stable rating outlook on may 6 2009 dbrs which had similarly rated caterpillar and cat financial slightly higher than moody’s and sp downgraded the company and cat financial to ‘a’ from ‘a high’ and stated that the trend for the rating was stable 

although the company and cat financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have a further adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part our access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

risks to financial products line of business 

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customer’s management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 

changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a material adverse effect on cat financial’s and our earnings and cash flows because a significant amount of the loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows in addition since cat financial makes a significant amount of loans in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows cat financial also relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations including commercial paper medium term notes retail notes variable denomination floating rate demand notes assetbacked securitizations and bank loans significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact cat financial’s access to funding increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows although cat financial manages interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to cat financial’s insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

the recent difficult and volatile market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry in which cat financial operates cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cat financial’s liquidity and ongoing profitability are in large part dependent upon its timely access to capital and the costs associated with raising funds in different segments of the capital markets cat financial depends and will continue to depend on its ability to access diversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flows requirements and to continue to fund its operations a large portion of cat financial’s borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets while cat financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for cat financial should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced cat financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient any of these events could negatively impact cat financial’s business results of operations and financial condition the extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of any future market disruptions the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market general credit conditions the volatility of equity and debt markets our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

should current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may also face a number of other risks in connection with these events including

market acceptance of products 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the global demand for our products generally depends on our customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds due to global economic conditions many of our customers may be experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations further due to capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty many financial institutions have revised their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if the capital and credit market volatility continues or worsens the liquidity of our customers may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with these other companies thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors’ behavior could have a material impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in our sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

caterpillar production system 

in 2006 we launched a significant productivity initiative cps to improve our ordertodelivery processes and factory efficiency cps aims to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers inability or failure to implement and utilize cps or other productivity initiatives would have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations there can be no assurance that this initiative will be completed or beneficial to the company or that any estimated cost savings from cps will be realized

international trade policy 

government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition for example a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

risks due to debt covenants 

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support i our commercial paper program and ii general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries including cat financial these covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated stockholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss of not less than 9 billion limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each december 31 not greater than 100 to 1 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended of not less than 115 to 1 and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us 

although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

in 2008 we received the consent of lenders under certain of our facilities to our lower consolidated net worth of 6087 billion as of december 31 2008 and to cat financial’s lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 097 as of december 31 2008 in consideration of these consents we agreed to increase the upper range of interest rates applicable to amounts that may be drawn by us and cat financial under certain of our facilities 

dealeroriginal equipment manufacturers sourcing practices 

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 

in particular some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future increased levels of production insourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

additional tax expense or additional tax exposure 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

risks to global operations 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally and in countries with political and economic instability including without limitation brazil prc and india which exposes our business operations to certain political and economic risks inherent in operating globally these risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a normal practice we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless they are already happening when the outlook is issued as a result the occurrence of one or more of these events has the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

currency fluctuations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar visàvis other currencies will affect the us dollar amounts of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition if such increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar are substantial 

risk due to funding obligations under pension plans 

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

impact of acquisitions 

we may from time to time engage in acquisitions involving risks including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions for example with any past or future acquisitions there is the possibility that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 17 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to continue implementing the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition in order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions that would be financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot guarantee any such acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

litigation and contingency 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition however we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of such contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve requiring us to make additional material payments which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

healthcare reform legislation 

healthcare reform is currently a high priority for the us presidential administration and us congress both the us house and the us senate have passed healthcare reform bills however this legislation remains subject to modification during the process of harmonizing the house and senate bills and its content and potential impact remain uncertain should any final legislation impose significant costs on the company including without limitation by making government subsidies received for medicareequivalent prescription drug coverage taxable this could have a material impact upon the company’s results of operations and competitive position 

changes in accounting standards 

our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

natural disasters 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes and other forms of severe weather in the us or in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and overseas suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend 

 

we have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing additionally we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues or intellectual property rights although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on may 14 2007 the epa issued a notice of violation to caterpillar inc alleging various violations of clean air act sections 203 206 and 207 the epa claims that caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter aftertreatment devices separately introducing into commerce a number of uncertified andor misbuilt engines and failing to timely report emissionsrelated defects caterpillar is currently engaging in negotiations with the epa to resolve these issues but it is too early in the process to place precise estimates on the potential exposure to penalties however caterpillar is cooperating with the epa and based upon initial discussions and although penalties could potentially exceed 100000 management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity 

on february 8 2009 an incident at caterpillar’s joliet illinois facility resulted in the release of approximately 3000 gallons of wastewater into the des plaines river in coordination with state and federal authorities appropriate remediation measures have been taken on february 23 2009 the illinois attorney general filed a complaint in will county circuit court containing seven counts of violations of state environmental laws and regulations each count seeks injunctive relief as well as statutory penalties of 50000 per violation and 10000 per day of violation in addition on march 5 2009 the epa served caterpillar with a notice of intent to file a civil administrative action notice indicating the epa’s intent to seek civil penalties for violations of the clean water act and oil pollution act on january 25 2010 the epa issued a revised notice seeking civil penalties in the amount of 167800 and caterpillar is preparing a response to the revised notice at this time we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

 

 

 

the competitive environment for caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include but are not limited to komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv hitachi construction machinery co terex corporation jc bamford ltd and doosan infracore co ltd each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with caterpillar products and each have varying degrees of regional focus john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co for example has numerous product lines that compete with caterpillar primarily in north america and latin america others like jcb offer a limited range of products that compete globally against caterpillar 

global industry demand increased in the first three quarters of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to gains in developing economies and commodity sectors demand in the developed economies declined during this period the financial crisis worsened after mid september leading to a worldwide recession and collapses in most commodity prices during fourth quarter 2008 industry demand in all regions dropped below fourth quarter 2007 levels 

caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and over 55 other companies worldwide it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as dhl international gmbh and united parcel service inc the unit has grown rapidly since its inception in 1987 

since its acquisition by caterpillar in june 2006 wholly owned subsidiary progress rail has continued its position in north america as a leading provider of a broad range of products based in albertville alabama progress rail is a leading provider of remanufactured locomotive railcar and track products and services to the north american railroad industry the company also has one of the most extensive rail service and supply networks in north america expansion into the railroad aftermarket business is a good fit with our strategic direction and leverages caterpillar’s global remanufacturing capabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engineturbine manufacturing and packaging environment the company designs manufactures markets and sells diesel heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for caterpillar machinery electric power generation systems onhighway vehicles and locomotives marine petroleum construction industrial agricultural and other applications in addition caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power generation applications 

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few global competitors who compete in a variety of markets that caterpillar serves and a larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range andor application principal global competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc mtu friedrichshafen and mtu detroit diesel both are a tognum group company and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems siemens ag power generation ge energy man diesel se mitsubishi heavy industries ltd and volvo penta part of ab volvo group compete in certain markets in which caterpillar competes an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co kawasaki heavy industries ltd rollsroyce group plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels

in north america caterpillar competes for sales of onhighway diesel engines with among others cummins inc detroit diesel corp and mercedesbenz both part of daimler ag navistar international corp and ab volvo group  outside north america caterpillar competes for sales of onhighway diesel engines with among others mitsubishi fuso truck  bus corp both part of daimler ag daf trucks nv dongfeng motor corporation fiat powertrain technologies spa man ag and scania ab some of these competitors are truck andor bus manufacturers with proprietary diesel engines who also offer engines from independent manufacturers such as caterpillar as previously announced caterpillar will not provide environmental protection agency epa 2010 compliant engines to truck and other onhighway original equipment manufacturers oems additionally by mid2009 caterpillar will supply a very limited number of epa 2007 compliant engines to truck and other onhighway oems 

since the introduction of its four engine models with acert® technology beginning in 2003 caterpillar has continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging acert technology into nonroad markets as well as into more of its engine platforms the building blocks for acert technology are flexible and scaleable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application from october 2004 through yearend 2008 caterpillar has shipped over 65000 caterpillar machines powered by engines with acert technology a line of acert industrial electric power and marine engines has been released to further leverage the technology throughout caterpillar’s businesses and engine platforms 

we believe acert provides caterpillar a valuable foundation now and in the future to meet emissions and performance requirements and we plan to continue investing in developing and leveraging acert technology systems and components 

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with enginesturbines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 140 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole 

previously caterpillar announced it would comply with tier 4 requirements for its nonroad engines and has invested significant rd expenditures on projects to ensure compliance which also includes the use of certain allowances and credits provided under the tier 4 regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

our financial products business is primarily conducted by cat financial cat financial incorporated in delaware is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of caterpillar cat financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for caterpillar products to customers around the world such retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of caterpillar equipment machinery and engines in addition cat financial also provides financing for vehicles power generation facilities and marine vessels that in most cases incorporate caterpillar products in addition to retail financing cat financial provides wholesale financing to caterpillar dealers and purchases shortterm dealer receivables from caterpillar the various financing plans offered by cat financial are designed to increase the opportunity for sales of caterpillar products and generate financing income for cat financial a significant portion of cat financials activities is conducted in north america however cat financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in asia australia europe and latin america

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financials competitors include wells fargo equipment finance inc general electric capital corporation and various local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors such as volvo financial services komatsu financial lp and john deere credit corporation use belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

cat financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors 

cat financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 – “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 also see the risk to financial services line of business for general risk associated with our financial products business on pages 17 and 18 of this form 10k 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financials operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge 

 

indicates the percentage of cat financials total portfolio at december 31 2008 we define total portfolio as total finance receivables net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses plus equipment on operating leases less accumulated depreciation for more information on the above and cat financials concentration of credit risk please refer to note 8 – “finance receivables” of exhibit 13

business developments in 2008 

economic and market conditions 

our business results of operations and financial condition are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy the global economic crisis and the volatility in the credit and capital markets which began in 2007 had a significant impact on our 2008 profitability overall the company realized record 2008 sales and revenues of 51324 billion with strong sales and revenues and profit per share for the first three quarters of the year however due to the deteriorating global economic conditions and the volatility of financial markets our fourth quarter profit per share of 108 was significantly depressed down 28 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 while sales and revenues of about 12923 billion increased 779 million from the fourth quarter of 2007 our fourth quarter profit of 661 million decreased by 314 million from 2007 fourth quarter profit this was due to the significantly higher manufacturing costs driven by higher material and freight costs along with manufacturing inefficiencies as costs did not drop in line with a sharp decline in production volume also we experienced a significant decrease in the profitability of our financial products business as a result of the turbulence in the financial markets 

as we move forward in 2009 the global economic conditions and key commodity prices have continued to decline significantly the financial markets remain under stress and our expectations for 2009 have deteriorated we are projecting 2009 sales and revenues to be in a range of plus or minus 10 percent from 40 billion down 25 percent from 2008 sales at 40 billion in sales and revenues in 2009 the company expects to achieve profit of about 200 per share or 250 per share excluding redundancy costs we have been rapidly executing our “trough” plans and implementing actions throughout the company to deal with a very challenging global business environment and to reduce costs some of the “trough” plans and actions include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while we expect the full year of 2009 to be very challenging profit in the first half and particularly the first quarter will be under severe pressure in fact a first quarter loss is possible 

as a result of the impact of the global economic downturn on our business many of the expansion plans announced in 2008 some of which are discussed below under growth initiatives are under review and will be implemented based on our spending priorities

business combinations 

information related to acquisitions and alliances appears in note 25 – “business combinations ” of exhibit 13 

raw materials and component products 

we source our raw materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally these purchases include unformed materials rough and finished parts unformed materials would be a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities rough parts would be various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made to either caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications we machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales we also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes we maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend we expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and delivery of raw materials and component products supplied for our machine and engine products we use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption the risks monitored include supplier financial viability business continuity quality and delivery 

order backlog 

much of our backlog is in large engines gas turbines and in mining products the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 147 billion at december 31 2008 and 178 billion at december 31 2007 of the total backlog approximately 22 billion at december 31 2008 and 25 billion at december 31 2007 was not expected to be filled in the following year our backlog is generally highest in the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying trends in our industry as we look forward to 2009 we expect our backlog to ease particularly in the mining sector which has begun to experience slowing investment activities due to declining commodity prices 

dealers 

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network  52 located in the united states and 128 located outside the united states serving 182 countries and operating 3537 places of business including dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins are also sold through its worldwide network of 131 distributors located in 172 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by fg wilson are sold through its worldwide network of 157 dealers located in 180 countries 

these dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal businesses turbines and large medium speed reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

 

 

page 9 

 

the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the companys trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer 

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the companys products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the companys product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request 

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

patents and trademarks 

our products are sold primarily under the brands caterpillar cat design versions of cat and caterpillar solar turbines mak perkins fg wilson olympian and “progress rail” we own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents 

research and development 

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2008 2007 and 2006 we spent 1728 million 1404 million and 1347 million or 34 percent 31 percent and 32 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs we expect rd expenditures in 2009 to decline somewhat from 2008 levels and we will emphasize product development required to meet tier 4 emissions requirements 

employment 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 112887 persons of whom 59378 were located outside the united states however due to deteriorating global economic conditions that are having a significant impact on our business the company is implementing workforce reductions that will reduce the number of employees in 2009 

in the united states most of our 53509 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

as of december 31 2008 there were 14899 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america represents 12262 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that will expire march 1 2011 the international association of machinists represents 2028 employees under labor agreements that expire on may 23 2010 and april 30 2012

environmental matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or global competitive position 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 2 – “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a  risk factors 

tableend 

 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the “notes to consolidated financial statements” of exhibit 13 to this form 10k in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the discussion and analysis contained in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other items in this form 10k is forwardlooking and involves uncertainties that could significantly impact results from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we issue to the public or in the form of oral presentation to the public forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company you can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe expect estimate anticipate will be should “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions that identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 

in particular these forwardlooking statements include statements relating to future actions prospective products products’ approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies economic conditions potential returns financial condition and financial results the statements are based on assumptions or on known or unknown risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions we cannot guarantee the realization of these statements achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you may however consult any future related disclosures we make on our form 10q or any form 8k report to the sec 

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from expected or past results you should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties 

changes in government monetary and fiscal policies 

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which alter demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affect sales of our products that serve these activities also interest rates affect customers’ abilities to finance machine purchases and can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated 

the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis reduced the availability of liquidity to fund investments in many markets that we serve the central banks and other policy arms of many countries have implemented various actions to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit the effectiveness of these and related government actions is uncertain and could have a material impact on the customers and markets we serve and our business results of operations and financial condition government policies on taxes and spending affect our businesses throughout the world government spending finances much infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users can retain both of which influence investment decisions developments more unfavorable than anticipated such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

government can also impact international trade and investment through a variety of policies such as import quotas inspections capital controls or tariffs developments worse than anticipated in the outlook which could include lower import quotas more detailed inspections or higher tariffs could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition

environmental regulations 

our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of general nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

particularly our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the us and other regulatory agencies around the world for instance governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

the epa has adopted new and more stringent emission standards including tier 4 nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011 we previously announced our intent to make our nonroad engines compliant with the new emission standards including the tier 4 emission requirements by the stated deadline our strategy for compliance includes using certain technology with state of art integrated systems as well as using the flexibility provided by the regulations 

although we are executing comprehensive plans designed to meet tier 4 emissions requirements these plans are subject to many variables including the timing of our tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction if we are unable to meet our plans as projected it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position 

credit and equity market volatility changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions of industries or markets we serve 

our results of operations are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and in the global capital markets the current global financial crisis which began in 2007 has deteriorated further and has caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets principally in the us europe and japan in some cases the markets have decreased availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers and customers 

although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses fund our capital expenditures buy back stock pay dividends and fund our employee retirement benefit programs our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements over the longterm will require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in many of the markets that we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations continuing market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact the ability of the company to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position 

in addition due to the decreased availability of and the related high cost in accessing liquidity and credit in this current volatile credit and capital market we may in a bid to conserve cash for operations undertake acquisitions that would be financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot guarantee any such acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

 

 

page 13 

 

the energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these industries if demand or output in these industries increases the demand for our products would likely increase likewise if demand or output in these industries declines the demand for our products would likely decrease prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions economic growth commodity inventories and any disruptions in production we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed have the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the us demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results 

residential housing starts have been declining in the us since early 2006 and housing permits in europe have declined since late 2006 the situation has worsened with the deterioration in mortgage and real estate markets and has negatively impacted our sales in north america and europe these downturns could continue if current levels of volatility and uncertainty in the global capital and credit markets persist or worsen although the us government has enacted the emergency economic stabilization act eesa and governments of many countries including countries in europe japan and australia have adopted similar initiatives to help restore viability in these markets and the economy generally there is no assurance that the measures stipulated in the eesa and other actions of the us government or the initiatives of other governments for the purpose of stabilizing the mortgage real estates and financial markets will achieve the intended effect 

the growth in the emerging markets ie africa asiapacific latin america the middle east and russia have positively impacted our sales and revenues and accounted for a significant portion of our 2008 sales and revenues however countries in emerging markets are beginning to experience slowing growth due to the impact of the global economic downturn as a result the volume of capital and infrastructure projects has declined and some governments are cutting spending on capital projects including construction and infrastructure if this trend continues or worsens our sales in the emerging markets could be adversely impacted which could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in price and significant shortages of component products 

we are a significant user of steel and many commodities required for the manufacture of our products as a result increases in the prices of such commodities likely would increase costs more than expected negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse affect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe our source of supply of raw materials will be generally sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future however our business results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should the supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations 

in addition the current general global economic downturn and the volatility in the credit and capital markets have caused a significant decline in sales and revenues and limited liquidity for many businesses if these conditions continue or worsen many of our suppliers’ financial viability could be adversely impacted as a result their ability to continue supplying component products for the manufacture of our products could be significantly undermined which in turn could negatively impact our ability to meet our customers’ demand for our products and our business results of operations and financial condition 

currency fluctuations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar visàvis other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial

dealeroriginal equipment manufacturers sourcing practices 

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 

in particular some of our engine customers are oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future increased levels of production insourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

impact of acquisitions 

we may from time to time engage in acquisitions involving some potential risks including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions for example with any past or future acquisitions there is the possibility that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to continue implementing the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition due to the decreased availability of and the related high cost in accessing liquidity and credit in this current volatile credit and capital market we may in a bid to conserve cash for operations undertake acquisitions that would be financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot guarantee any such acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales predicated on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete successfully with these other companies thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

 

page 15 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace changes in market acceptance of price increases changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors’ behavior could have a material impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

changes in accounting standards 

our financial statements are subject to the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

litigation and contingency 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition however we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

as required by gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of such contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve requiring us to make additional material payments which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks to global operations 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally and countries with political and economic instability each of which exposes our business operations to certain political and economic risks inherent in operating globally these risks include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 16 

as a normal practice we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless they are already happening when the outlook is issued as a result the occurrence of one or more of these events has the potential to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

risk due to funding obligations under pension plans 

we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain payment obligations towards the funding of the plans in determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs an adverse significant change in the credit and capital market conditions could result in actual rates of return and growth rates being materially lower than projected this could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and as a result adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks due to debt covenants 

we maintain a number of credit facilities to support i our commercial paper program and ii general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants including limits on subsidiary debt the incurrence of liens minimum levels of consolidated net worth minimum interest coverage ratios and restrictions on consolidation and merger 

although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition such adverse consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries 

we recently received the consent of lenders under certain credit facilities to our lower consolidated net worth of 6087 billion as of december 31 2008 and to cat financial’s lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 097 as of december 31 2008 in consideration of these consents we agreed to increase the upper range of interest rates applicable to certain amounts that may be drawn by us and cat financial under certain credit facilities by approximately 100 to 150 percentage points and by cat financial under certain of its other facilities by approximately 100 percentage point 

 

risks to financial services line of business 

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 

changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows because a significant amount of loans made by cat financial are made at fixed interest rates our business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flow in addition since cat financial makes a significant amount of loans in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce our earnings and cash flow cat financial also relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations including commercial paper medium term notes retail notes variable denomination floating rate demand notes assetbacked securitizations and bank loans significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact cat financial’s access to funding and the associated funding costs and reduce its earnings and cash flow although cat financial manages interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flow if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective we may incur losses with respect to cat financial’s insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

 

page 17 

the current difficult and volatile market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry in which cat financial operates cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

cat financial’s liquidity and ongoing profitability are in large part dependent upon its timely access to capital and the costs associated with raising funds in different segments of the capital markets cat financial depends and will continue to depend on its ability to access diversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flow requirements and to continue to fund its operations a large portion of cat financials borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets and although cat financial has continued to have access to most of these markets there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for cat financial if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen cat financial could face materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business or seek to repay medium term notes and commercial paper as it becomes due or to meet its other liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks andor by seeking other funding sources however under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient the extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs will depend on several factors including our operating cash flow the duration of any market disruption the effects of governmental programs such as the federal deposit insurance corporation’s fdic’s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp credit conditions generally the volatility of equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

should current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen we may also face a number of other risks in connection with these events including

government programs designed to support credit markets 

a number of governmental programs designed to support the global financial system were implemented in 2008 while we generally support these programs there have been unintended consequences of the programs that have impacted cat financial and other companies that do not qualify to participate in them as an example in the united states some of cat financials competitors in the banking and manufacturing sectors have participated in the tlgp the tlgp was created to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by providing a government guaranty of certain qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies despite the fdic’s intent to support the banking system through the tlgp some of cat financials competitors in the manufacturing sector have been permitted to participate in this program and issue senior unsecured debt with governmental guarantees at rates significantly below those capable of being offered by cat financial likewise cat financials ability to issue debt rates that are competitive with those offered by its banking competitors has been further disadvantaged and accentuated at times by their participation in governmental programs such as the tlgp the tlgp as well as other governmental initiatives have effectively created belowmarket government subsidized financing for such competitors this program and other similar governmental programs in various jurisdictions have disadvantaged cat financial and other nonqualifying companies the tlgp is currently set to expire on june 30 2009 although the fdic has indicated that it plans to extend the program at least through october 31 2009 other governmental programs may not have clear expiration dates should the tlgp or any other governmental program that disadvantages cat financial be extended or expanded by its respective government cat financial could continue to be negatively impacted in its ability to issue senior unsecured debt at rates that are comparable to those offered by its competition 

market acceptance of products 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the global demand for our products generally depends on our customers’ ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds due to global economic conditions many of our customers may be experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations further due to capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty many financial institutions have revised their lending standards thereby decreasing access to capital if the capital and credit market volatility continues or worsens the liquidity of our customers may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 

natural disasters 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes and other forms of severe weather in the us or in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and overseas suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers

we have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing additionally we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues or intellectual property rights although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

on may 14 2007 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation to caterpillar inc alleging various violations of clean air act sections 203 206 and 207 epa claims that caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter aftertreatment devices separately introducing into commerce a number of uncertified andor misbuilt engines and failing to timely report emissionsrelated defects caterpillar is currently engaging in negotiations with epa to resolve these issues but we are unable at this time to place precise estimates on the potential exposure to penalties however caterpillar is cooperating with epa and based upon initial discussions and although penalties could potentially exceed 100000 management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

on september 29 2004 kruse technology partnership kruse filed a lawsuit against caterpillar in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that certain caterpillar engines built from october 2002 to the present infringe upon certain claims of three of kruses patents on engine fuel injection timing and combustion strategies caterpillar denied kruses allegations and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration from the court that caterpillar is not infringing upon kruses patents and that the patents are invalid and unenforceable on december 20 2008 caterpillar and kruse entered into a confidential settlement agreement whereby all pending claims with regard to the lawsuit were settled the settlement which did not have a material impact on our financial statements included an agreement by both parties to not bring any future actions in the matter subsequent to the agreement the court entered an order dismissing the case

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions 

 

 

 

the competitive environment for caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include but are not limited to komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv hitachi construction machinery co terex corporation jc bamford ltd and doosan infracore co ltd each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with caterpillar product lines and each have varying degrees of regional focus john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co for example has numerous product lines that compete with caterpillar primarily in north america and latin america others like hitachi offer a limited range of products that compete globally against caterpillar 

during 2007 global industry demand continued to be strong and most competitors experienced increased sales and operating profits despite weak construction activity in north america solid economic and industry growth was experienced in most of the world outside north america particularly in emerging markets the overall competitive environment in the machinery business continues to be intense and the overall financial health of the industry continues to improve 

caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and over 65 other companies worldwide it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as dhl express usa inc and united parcel service inc the unit has grown rapidly since its inception in 1987 and the contract logistics industry is expected to continue to grow at rates above that of the global economy as a whole 

since its acquisition by caterpillar in june 2006 wholly owned subsidiary progress rail has continued its position in north america as a leading provider of a broad range of products based in albertville alabama progress rail is a leading provider of remanufactured locomotive railcar and track products and services to the north american railroad industry the company also has one of the most extensive rail service and supply networks in north america expansion into the railroad aftermarket business is a strong fit with our strategic direction and will leverage caterpillar’s global remanufacturing capabilities 

in february 2007 caterpillar acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of franklin power products and international fuel systems inc subsidiaries of remy international these businesses joined other caterpillar remanufacturing facilities in the united states mexico europe and asia increasing our overall product and service offering and providing a platform for future growth opportunities for remanufactured products 

in november 2007 caterpillar announced the acquisition of the assets of the blount forestry division and assumed product design development and manufacturing responsibilities offering a full range of products and services for logging millyard roadbuilding and land management competition in this market comes from john deere forestry division part of deere  co komatsu ltd and others 

 

 

 

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engineturbine manufacturing and packaging environment the company designs manufactures markets and sells diesel heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for caterpillar machinery electric power generation systems onhighway vehicles and locomotives marine petroleum construction industrial agricultural and other applications in addition caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power generation applications 

 

page 2 

 

the competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine petroleum construction industrial agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few global competitors who compete in a variety of caterpillar’s markets and a larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range andor application principal global competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc mtu friedrichshafen and mtu detroit diesel both part of tognum gmbh and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems part of deere  co siemens power generation part of siemens ag ge energy man ag mitsubishi heavy industries ltd and volvo penta part of volvo group ab compete in a portion of caterpillar’s markets an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co kawasaki heavy industries ltd rollsroyce group plc and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels 

in the north american onhighway heavyduty and midrange diesel engine markets competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc detroit diesel corp and mercedesbenz both part of daimler ag navistar international corp and volvo group ab  o nhighway diesel engine competitors in overseas markets include but are not limited to mercedesbenz and mitsubishi fuso truck  bus corp both part of daimler ag daf trucks nv iveco motors part of fiat spa man ag scania ab and volvo group ab some of these competitors are truck andor bus manufacturers with proprietary diesel engines who also offer engines from independent manufacturers such as caterpillar 

since the introduction of our four engine models with acert® technology beginning in 2003 caterpillar has shipped over 550000 acert engines into the north american onhighway truck market customer acceptance of caterpillar engine performance quality and reliability continues to be strong as evidenced by receiving a jd power and associates award in customer satisfaction in 2007 for an unprecedented seventh year 

caterpillar also continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging acert technology into offroad markets as well as into more of our engine platforms the building blocks for acert technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application from october 2004 through yearend 2007 caterpillar has shipped over 65000 caterpillar machines powered by engines with acert technology a line of acert industrial electric power and marine engines has been released to further leverage the technology throughout caterpillar’s businesses and engine platforms 

we believe acert provides caterpillar a valuable foundation now and in the future to meet emissions and performance requirements and we plan to continue investing in developing and leveraging acert technology systems and components 

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with enginesturbines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 100 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financials competitors include cit group inc citicapital a business unit of citigroup general electric capital corporation and various local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors use belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to respond to these competing offers 

cat financials results are largely dependent upon caterpillar dealers ability to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

cat financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 – “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13 

 

page 4 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financials operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge 

 

cat financial provides financing only when acceptable criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other things the customers credit history financial strength and equipment application cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment especially in north america cat financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs subsidized by caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers which allow it to offer belowmarket interest rates under these programs caterpillar or the dealer subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing transaction processing time and supporting technologies continue to drive cat financial in its efforts to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing efficiencies we believe cat financials webbased cat financ express sm transaction processing and information tool currently available in the united states france canada and australia provides cat financial a competitive advantage in those areas cat financ express collects information online to provide finance quotes and credit decisions and then prints the related documents all in a very short time frame

environmental matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or global competitive position 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item “accrued expenses” in statement 2 – “consolidated financial position at december 31” of exhibit 13 

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend 

 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with the “management’s discussion and analysis” of exhibit 13 in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the discussion and analysis in this form 10k and in our 2007 annual report to stockholders that are forwardlooking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we issue to the public or in the form of oral presentation to the public forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company you can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe expect estimate anticipate will be should “plan” “project” “intend” “could” and similar words or expressions that identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 

in particular these forwardlooking statements include statements relating to future actions prospective products products’ approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies and financial results the statements are based on assumptions or on known or unknown risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions we cannot guarantee the realization of these statements achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you may however consult any further related disclosures we make in our form 10q or any form 8k reports to the sec 

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from expected and past results you should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties 

 

page 10 

changes in government monetary and fiscal policies 

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which alter demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affect sales of our products that serve these activities also interest rates affect customers’ abilities to finance machine purchases and can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated 

government policies on taxes and spending affect our businesses throughout the world government spending finances much infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users can retain both of which influence investment decisions developments more unfavorable than anticipated such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

government can also impact international trade and investment through a variety of policies such as import quotas inspections capital controls or tariffs developments worse than anticipated in the outlook which could include lower import quotas more detailed inspections or higher tariffs could negatively impact our results 

environmental regulations 

our facilities and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of general nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 

particularly our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the us and other various regulatory agencies around the world for instance governments may set new standards that could impact our operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to impact our results negatively 

changes in economic conditions of industries we serve 

the energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these industries if demand of output in these industries increases the demand for our products would likely increase and vice versa prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to economic growth commodity inventories and any disruptions in production we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed have the potential to negatively impact our sales 

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the us or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted 

changes in price and significant shortages of component products 

we are a significant user of steel and many commodities required for the manufacture of our products so increases in the prices of such commodities likely would boost costs higher than expected negatively impacting profits 

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased in availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse affect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe our source of supply of raw materials will be generally sufficient for our need in the foreseeable future however our results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should the supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations

currency fluctuations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar visàvis other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial  

dealeroriginal equipment manufacturers sourcing practices 

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network or directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 

in particular some of our engine customers are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future increased levels of production insourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturers or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

impact of acquisitions 

we may from time to time engage in acquisitions involving some potential risks including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions for example with any past or future acquisitions there is the possibility that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to continue implementing the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales predicated on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete successfully with these other companies thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announced from time to time will hold in the marketplace while we expect that the environment will continue to absorb these price actions changes in marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results moreover additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated realization 

 

page 12 

 

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

litigation and contingency 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty environmental claims and lawsuits including other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our results however we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves based on our assessment of such contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve requiring us to make additional materials payments which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks to global operations 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally countries with political and economic instability exposing our business operations to certain political and economic risks inherent in operating in some countries these risks include 

 

 

 

 

as a normal practice we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless already happening when the outlook is issued so the occurrence of one of these events has the potential to negatively impact our results 

 

risks to financial services segment 

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 

 

changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows because a significant amount of loans made by us are made at fixed interest rates our business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows in addition since we make a significant amount of loans in currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce our earnings and cash flows we also rely on a number of diversified global debt capital markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for our global operations including commercial paper medium term notes retail notes variable denomination floating rate demand notes assetbacked securitizations and bank loans significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact our access to funding and the associated funding cost and reduce our earnings and cash flows although we manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks with a variety of techniques including a match funding program the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we use to hedge our exposure to these various types of risk are ineffective we may incur losses 

 

page 13 

 

with respect to our insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

 

 

market acceptance of products 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have material impact on our business 

natural disasters 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes and other forms of severe weather in the us or in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and overseas suppliers disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and endusers and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers 

for instance on february 5 2008 a certain portion of our facility in oxford mississippi that manufactures hose couplings for most of our machinery was physically damaged by a tornado for the next few months assembly operations covering a broad range of machinery will be sporadically impacted as a result of the tornado damage this event could adversely impact our results

 item 3 legal proceedings 

tableend 

we have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing additionally we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business the most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure contracts employment issues or intellectual property rights although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

on may 14 2007 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a notice of violation to caterpillar inc alleging various violations of clean air act sections 203 206 and 207 epa claims that caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter aftertreatment devices separately introducing into commerce a number of uncertified andor misbuilt engines and failing to timely report emissionsrelated defects caterpillar is currently engaging in negotiations with epa to resolve these issues but it is too early in the process to place precise estimates on the potential exposure to penalties however caterpillar is cooperating with epa and based upon initial discussions and although penalties could potentially exceed 100 thousand management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

on september 29 2004 kruse technology partnership kruse filed a lawsuit against caterpillar in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that certain caterpillar engines built from october 2002 to the present infringe upon certain claims of three of kruses patents on engine fuel injection timing and combustion strategies kruse seeks monetary damages injunctive relief and a finding that the alleged infringement by caterpillar was willful caterpillar denies kruses allegations believes they are without merit and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration from the court that caterpillar is not infringing upon kruses patents and that the patents are invalid and unenforceable the counterclaim filed by caterpillar is pending and no trial date is currently scheduled in the opinion of management the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries 

 

 

 

the competitive environment for caterpillar’s machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors examples of global competitors include but are not limited to komatsu ltd volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv hitachi construction machinery co terex corporation jcb and ingersollrand company limited each have varying numbers of product lines that compete with caterpillar product lines and each have varying degrees of regional focus john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co for example has numerous product lines that compete with caterpillar primarily in north america and latin america others like ingersollrand offer a limited range of products that compete against caterpillar but do compete globally 

during 2006 global industry demand continued to be strong and most competitors experienced increased sales and operating profit also in 2006 offhighway emissions regulations in europe north america and japan required caterpillar and its competitors to introduce products with emissionscompliant engines in a certain horsepower range in some cases competitors also timed product upgrades to coincide with these emissions requirements the overall competitive environment in the machinery business continues to be intense and the overall financial health of the industry continues to improve 

caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and over 60 other companies worldwide it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as dhl and ups the unit has grown rapidly since its inception in 1987 and the contract logistics industry is expected to continue to grow at rates above that of the global economy as a whole 

progress rail a newly acquired business has achieved a leading market position in north america as a provider of a broad range of products and services for both railroad rolling stock and the railroad track infrastructure and a supplier of reconditioned and remanufactured railroad freight car and locomotive components progress rail leverages its extensive network of plant and service facilities to provide customers high quality products and services with lower shipping costs and faster turnaround times these elements along with progress rail’s ability to source a substantial volume of reconditionable parts to its railcar and locomotive remanufacturing operations provide progress rail with a sustainable cost advantage and competitive prices for its customers 

 

 

 

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engineturbine manufacturing and packaging environment the company manufactures diesel heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for the on and offhighway markets and provides industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power generation applications caterpillar designs manufactures assembles and distributes electrical generator sets and compression packages that can be customized with a wide range of ancillary equipment and performance options to create fully integrated electric power and compression systems 

 

page 2 

 

the competitive environment for offhighway enginesturbines and generator sets consists of a few global competitors who compete in a variety of caterpillar’s markets and a larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range andor application principal global competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc mtu friedrichshafen and mtu detroit diesel both part of tognum gmbh and wartsila corp other competitors such as john deere power systems part of deere  co siemens power generation part of siemens ag general electric company and volvo penta part of volvo group ab compete in a portion of caterpillar’s markets an additional set of competitors including generac power systems inc kohler co and others are packagers who source engines andor other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels 

in the north american onhighway heavyduty and midrange diesel engine markets competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc detroit diesel corp and mercedesbenz both part of daimlerchrysler ag navistar international corp and volvo group ab  o nhighway diesel engine competitors in overseas markets include but are not limited to mercedesbenz and mitsubishi fuso truck  bus corp both part of daimler chrysler ag iveco motors part of fiat spa man ag scania ab and volvo group ab some of these competitors are truck andor bus manufacturers with proprietary diesel engines who also offer engines from independent manufacturers such as caterpillar during 2006 onhighway engine competitors worked to meet strong global demand for their products while in north america preparing to meet tightening january 1 2007 united states environmental protection agency epa emissions requirements 

during 2006 caterpillar continued in its leadership position in the north american onhighway truck market since the introduction of its five engine models with acert® technology beginning in 2003 the company has shipped over 450000 acert engines into the north american onhighway truck market and continued to maintain its leadership position in this market customer acceptance of caterpillar acert engine performance quality and reliability is strong as evidenced by an unprecedented sixth jd power and associates award 

caterpillar received epa certification for the c7 c13 and c15 acert engines in november 2006 the c9 acert engine epa application was recently submitted and certification is expected in early 2007 

caterpillar also continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging acert technology into offroad markets as well as into more of its engine platforms the building blocks for acert technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application from october 2004 through yearend 2006 the company has shipped over 30000 caterpillar machines powered by engines with acert technology a line of acert industrial electric power and marine engines has been released to further leverage the technology throughout caterpillar’s businesses and engine platforms caterpillar was the first company to offer a full line of tier 3stage iiia emissions compliant offhighway engines 

our 2007 onhighway acert engines have been validated in the field to meet the new emissions regulations while maintaining the fuel economy and durability characteristics of our current onhighway engines the 2007 production engines began shipping in january with volumes to increase throughout the year the acert technologies in this product were expanded to include the aftertreatment system caterpillar environmental technologies mexico s de rl de cv was formed to design and manufacture the diesel particulate filter dpf 

we believe acert provides caterpillar a valuable foundation now and in the future to meet emissions and performance requirements and we plan to continue investing in developing and leveraging acert technology systems and components 

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with enginesturbines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 100 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole

in certain instances cat financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices vi prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans and vii regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financials competitors include cit group inc citicapital a business unit of citigroup general electric capital corporation and local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors use belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to respond to these competing offers 

cat financials results are largely dependent upon caterpillar dealers ability to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

cat financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3  “derivative financial instruments and risk management” of exhibit 13

dealers 

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of independent dealers dealer network  54 located in the united states and 128 located outside the united states worldwide these dealers serve 182 countries and operate 3576 places of business including 1639 dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins engines company limited perkins also are sold through a worldwide network of 132 distributors located in 181 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by fg wilson are sold through a worldwide network of 200 dealers located in 180 countries 

these dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal businesses turbines and large marine and large power generation reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by the company at times these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to use the companys trademarks service marks and brand names in some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

we are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in statement 2  “consolidated financial position at december 31  accrued expenses  of exhibit 13 

we cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation currently we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

 item 1a business risk factors tableend 

 

the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with the  “management’s discussion and analysis” of exhibit 13 in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the discussion and analysis in this form 10k and in our 2006 annual report to stockholders that are forwardlooking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we issue to the public or in the form of oral presentation to the public forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company you can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe expect estimate anticipate will be should “plan” “project” “intend” and similar words or expressions that identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 

 

page 10 

 

in particular these forwardlooking statements include statements relating to future actions prospective products products’ approvals future performance or results of current and anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies and financial results the statements are based on assumptions or on known or unknown risks and uncertainties although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions we cannot guarantee the realization of these statements achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you may however consult any further related disclosures we make in our form 10q or any form 8k reports to the sec 

the following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business these are factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from expected and past results you should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties 

changes in government monetary and fiscal policies 

most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which alter demand for residential and nonresidential structures energy and mined products which in turn affect sales of our products that serve these activities also interest rates affect customers’ abilities to finance machine purchases and can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries interest rates higher than those assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated 

government policies on taxes and spending affect our businesses throughout the world government spending finances much infrastructure development such as highways airports sewer and water systems and dams tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users can retain both of which influence investment decisions developments more unfavorable than anticipated such as declines in government revenues decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes could negatively impact our results 

government can also impact international trade and investment through a variety of policies such as import quotas inspections capital controls or tariffs developments worse than anticipated in the outlook which could include lower import quotas more detailed inspections or higher tariffs could negatively impact our results 

environmental regulations 

our facilities and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of general nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future compliance with all aforementioned existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

particularly our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies in the us and other various regulatory agencies around the world although current compliance with all existing emissions and noise requirements has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position governments may set new standards that could impact our operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy thus significant changes in standards or the adoption of new standards have the potential to impact our results negatively 

 

page 11 

 

changes in economic conditions of industries we serve 

the energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these industries if demand of output in these industries increases the demand for our products would likely increase and vice versa prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to economic growth commodity inventories and any disruptions in production we assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks commodity prices lower than those assumed have the potential to negatively impact our sales 

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the us or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted 

changes in price and significant shortages of component products 

we are a significant user of steel and many commodities required for the manufacture of our products so increases in the prices of such commodities likely would boost costs higher than expected negatively impacting profits 

we rely on suppliers to secure component products particularly steel required for the manufacture of our products a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased in availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse affect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe our source of supply of raw materials will be generally sufficient for our need in the foreseeable future however our results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should the supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations 

currency fluctuations 

the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets liabilities expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates as a result increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar visàvis other currencies or vice versa will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar or other currencies is substantial    

 

dealeroriginal equipment manufacturers sourcing practices 

we sell finished products through an independent dealer network or directly to oems both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively 

in particular some of our engine customers are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future increased levels of production insourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries a significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturers or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disease epidemics 

historical data shows that major flu epidemics often caused sharp drops in economic output such epidemics are difficult to forecast either in their occurrence or in their impact so such an event would have the potential to impact our results more unfavorably than we would assume in our outlooks 

 

page 12 

 

impact of acquisitions 

we may from time to time engage in acquisitions involving some potential risks including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions for example with any past or future acquisitions there is the possibility that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to continue implementing the company’s acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales predicated on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace the company competes on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete successfully with these other companies thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealerowned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our 2007 sales outlook assumes that the price increases announced for january 2007 hold in the marketplace while we expect that the environment will continue to absorb these price actions changes in marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results moreover additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated realization 

in addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

litigation and contingency 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits we are involved in various intellectual property product liability product warranty environmental claims and lawsuits including other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit and the range of probable loss we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our results however we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period in addition while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims 

as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we establish reserves based on our assessment of such contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve requiring us to make additional materials payments which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

page 13 

 

risks to global operations 

our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including countries with political and economic instability exposing our business operations to certain political and economic risks inherent in operating in some countries these risks include 

 

 

 

 

as a normal practice we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless already happening when the outlook is issued so the occurrence of one of these events has the potential to negatively impact our results 

risks to financial services segment 

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral additionally interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt our match funding policy addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis to achieve our match funding objectives we issue debt with a similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated our financial results could be negatively impacted with respect to our insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

market acceptance of products 

our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products to achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers oems and customers this is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs in addition our continued success is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations this means we must be able to obtain patents that lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have material impact on our business

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries 

 

the competitive environment for caterpillars machinery business consists of global competitors regional competitors and specialized local competitors principal global competitors include komatsu volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global nv hitachi construction machinery co ltd terex corporation jcb and ingersollrand company limited each has a particular product line andor regional pockets of strength john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co is a principal competitor only in north and south america some competitors have broad ranges of products that compete with caterpillar others like ingersollrand only offer a limited range of products that compete with caterpillar 

during 2005 increased demand for construction machinery continued and most of our competitors saw continued improvement in sales and operating profit supply chain and material cost challenges continued for many major competitors distribution channel challenges experienced by some competitors moderated somewhat asiabased competitors with significant business in china benefited from industry improvements there europebased competitors remain most impacted by the value of the euro most north americabased competitors continued to benefit from strong north american industry demand the competitive environment in the machinery business remains intense and the financial health of the industry as a whole continues to improve 

caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for caterpillar and to over fifty other companies worldwide it competes with global regional and local competitors including companies such as dhl and ups the unit has grown rapidly since its inception in 1987 and the contract logistics industry is expected to continue to grow at rates above that of the global economy as a whole 

 

caterpillar operates in a very competitive engine turbine manufacturing and packaging environment in north america onhighway heavyduty and midrange diesel engine competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc volvo group ab mack trucks inc part of volvo group ab detroit diesel corp and mercedesbenz both part of daimlerchrysler ag isuzu motors ltd and navistar international corp during 2005 these truck engine competitors continued to market heavyduty and midrange onhighway emissionscertified engines meeting the current united states environmental protection agency epa emission requirements overseas onhighway diesel engine competitors include but are not limited to mercedesbenz part of daimlerchrysler ag volvo group ab mitsubishi fuso truck  bus corp part of daimler chrysler ag scania ab man aktiengesellschaft iveco motors isuzu motors ltd hino motors ltd and mwm motores diesel in addition the industry continued strong investment in new technology to meet future on and offhighway emission regulations in north america europe and asia

in the north america offhighway mobile and stationary markets domesticbased competitors include but are not limited to cummins inc john deere power systems part of deere  co detroit diesel corp ford power products part of ford motor co general electric co kohler co katolight corp generac power systems inc multiquip inc stewart  stevenson services inc waukesha part of dresser inc and other regional companies overseasbased offhighway mobile and stationary competitors include but are not limited to wartsila nsd man bw diesel ag mtu friedrichshafen gmbh part of daimlerchrysler ag volvo penta part of volvo group ab mitsubishi heavy industries ltd deutz ag ge jenbacher part of general electric co kubota corp isuzu motors ltd yanmar diesel engine co ltd bergen part of rolls royce plc rollsroyce plc siemens ag alstom sdmo himoinsa sl atlas copco ab kawasaki heavy industries ltd and aksa power generation kazanci holding some of these competitors are packagers who source emissioncompliant as well as noncompliant engines and turbines and other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels 

during 2005 caterpillar continued in its leadership position in the north america onhighway truck market since the introduction of its five engine models with acert® technology beginning in 2003 the company has shipped over 300000 acert engines into the north america onhighway truck market and continued to maintain its leadership position in this market customer acceptance of caterpillar acert engine performance quality and reliability is strong 

caterpillar also continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging acert technology into offroad markets as well as into more of its engine platforms the building blocks for acert technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application since october 2004 through yearend 2005 the company has shipped 45 models of caterpillar machines powered by engines with acert technology with a further 25 models planned for introduction in 2006 a line of nine acert industrial engines has been released and acert technology will be further leveraged throughout caterpillars businesses and engine platforms we expect this to establish caterpillar as the first company to offer a full line of tier 3stage iiia emission compliant offhighway engines 

we believe acert provides caterpillar a competitive advantage now and in the future to meet emission and performance requirements and we plan to continue investing in developing and leveraging acert technology systems and components 

caterpillar’s remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to caterpillar and other external clients the remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies the company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with engines and is now one of the world’s largest remanufacturers processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 100 million pounds of remanufactured products each year the business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole

in certain instances cat financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state federal and various foreign governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which among other things i regulate credit granting activities ii establish maximum interest rates finance charges and other charges iii require disclosures to customers iv govern secured transactions v set collection foreclosure repossession and other trade practices vi prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans and vii regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financials competitors include cit group inc citicapital a business unit of citigroup general electric capital corporation and local banks and finance companies in addition many of our manufacturing competitors use belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to respond to these competing offers 

cat financials results are largely dependent upon caterpillar dealers ability to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements it is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

cat financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy cat financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 on pages a14 and a15 of exhibit 13

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financials operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios none of these foreign currency forward contracts is designated as a hedge 

cat financial provides financing only when acceptable criteria are met credit decisions are based on among other things the customers credit history financial strength and equipment application cat financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment cat financial finances a significant portion of caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of caterpillar equipment especially in north america cat financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs subsidized by caterpillar andor caterpillar dealers which allow it to offer belowmarket interest rates under these programs caterpillar or the dealer subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction which cat financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing transaction processing time and the supporting technologies continue to drive cat financial in its efforts to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing efficiencies we believe cat financials webbased cat financ express sm transaction processing and information tool currently available in the united states france canada and australia helps to give cat financial a competitive advantage in those areas cat financ express collects information online to provide finance quotes and credit decisions and then prints the related documents all in a very short time frame

environmental matters 

we strive to be a global leader in sustainability and we promote sustainable development consistent with our business goals in line with our vision 2020 strategy 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use of substances and control of emissions in addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations these laws often impact the development of our products including through required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

we are cleaning up contamination at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is probable we will pay cleanup costs at a site and those costs can be estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in formulating that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others the amount recorded for environmental cleanup is not material and is included in statement 2 on page a6 of exhibit 13 under accrued expenses   

we cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of cleanup currently we have several sites in the very early stages of cleanup and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for cleanup at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

the u s federal reserve board has raised interest rates at 14 consecutive meetings and while hinting the tightening cycle is about over has not clearly specified at what rate it plans to stop overall economic growth has slowed however business investment and manufacturing continue to perform strongly should the fed decide to continue with several more rate increases prospects for business investment and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently to impact sales opportunities in the eurozone any additional interest rate increases there could halt an economic recovery that just started in the last half of 2005 jeopardizing a modest improvement in sales 

production capacity 

the ongoing recovery in the world economy as well as in caterpillar sales has extensively used available productive capacity in many industries and stressed the worlds transportation system our forecast for 2006 assumes continued good world economic growth as well as another increase in our sales as a result capacity in a number of industries could become even tighter and more vulnerable to disruptions such as labor disagreements weather or lack of raw materials such disruptions could result in material cost spikes disruptions in production or increased inefficiencies all of which would impair our ability to efficiently meet customer demand 

metal and energy prices 

the increase in metals and energy prices since 2002 has significantly boosted demand for machines and engines factors causing higher prices tight supplies and growing demand are expected to remain in place in 2006 however metals and energy prices are volatile and a sudden drop in demand perhaps resulting from weaker economic growth could cause a collapse in prices such an event would weaken economic growth in many developing countries and reduce investments in new production capacity for metals and energy

safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of 1995 

 

certain statements contained in our managements discussion and analysis are forwardlooking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results the words believes expects estimates anticipates will be should and similar words or expressions identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 

 

world economic factors 

our projection for about 35 percent growth in the world economy in 2006 assumes central banks will cautiously raise interest rates so as not to slow growth too much low interest rates and continued good economic growth should encourage further growth in construction and mining should central banks raise interest rates aggressively both world economic growth and our machinery and engines sales likely would be weaker 

we expect the u s federal reserve will soon end its policy of raising interest rates and that the federal funds rate will end the year below five percent somewhat higher interest rates should cause a further slowing in economic growth to slightly over three percent in 2006 other financial factors  longterm interest rates corporate bond spreads  are expected to remain sufficiently favorable to support further growth in business investment should financial conditions tighten noticeably causing economic growth to slow below three percent expected improvements in machinery and engines sales likely would be lower than projected 

our projection of increased sales of machinery and engines in europe africa middle east eame in 2006 assumes that continued low interest rates will allow slightly faster economic growth in europe and that favorable commodity prices will extend healthy recoveries in both africa and middle east ame and the commonwealth of independent states cis key risks are significant interest rate increases in the eurozone that would slow the european economy or a worldwide collapse in commodity prices those developments would likely negatively impact our results 

 

page 17 

somewhat higher local interest rates in latin america in 2006 and slower economic growth in the united states are expected to contribute to a further slowing in latin american economic growth to slightly less than four percent that rate of growth should support further increases in construction spending and high metals prices should benefit investment in mining both contributing to an increase in machinery and engines sales this forecast is vulnerable to a significant weakening in commodity prices widespread increases in interest rates or political disruptions 

in asiapacific we project economic growth will remain slightly below 65 percent in 2006 with faster growth in australia and developing asia offsetting a slight slowing in china the projected increase in machinery and engines sales assumes that coal and metals prices will contribute to increased mine investment growing populations and rising home prices will benefit housing construction and rapid economic growth will prompt businesses to invest more in structures some developments that could lower expected results include reduced demand for thermal and coking coal significant revaluations of regional currencies restrictions on regional exports and sharp interest rate hikes particularly in china and indonesia 

commodity prices 

commodities represent a significant sales opportunity with prices and production as key drivers prices have improved sharply over the past three years and our outlook assumes that continued growth in world industrial production low inventories and some difficulties in increasing production will cause metals prices to remain high enough in 2006 to encourage further mine investment any unexpected weakening in world industrial production however could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results 

coal prices showed softness in some regions late in 2005 but remained well above prices that make mine investment attractive we expect that the need to rebuild some coal stocks as well as increased electricity generation will support demand for coal in 2006 and prices will remain favorable should coal prices soften due to a slowing in world economic growth or otherwise the ongoing sales recovery would be vulnerable 

oil and natural gas prices increased sharply over the past three years due to strong demand and high capacity usage higher energy prices have not halted economic recoveries since strong demand boosted prices and world production increased high prices are encouraging more exploration and development however should significant supply cuts occur such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country the resulting oil shortages and price spikes could slow economies potentially with a depressing impact on our sales 

monetary and fiscal policies 

for most companies operating in a global economy monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the united states and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth and accordingly demand for our product in general higher than expected interest rates reductions in government spending higher taxes excessive currency movements and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 

with economic data looking more favorable central banks in several developed countries have raised interest rates from the lowest rates in decades with the u s federal reserve bank being the most aggressive our outlook assumes that central banks will try to avoid increasing rates so much that economic recoveries stall should central banks raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated both economic growth and our sales could suffer 

budget deficits in many countries remain higher than governments would like our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect our sales 

 

political factors 

political factors in the united states and abroad can impact global companies our outlook assumes that no major disruptive changes in economic policies occur in either the united states or other major economies significant changes in either taxing or spending policies could reduce activities in sectors important to our businesses thereby reducing sales 

 

page 18 

our outlook assumes that there will be no additional significant military conflicts in either north korea or the middle east in the forecast period such military conflicts could severely disrupt sales into countries affected as well as nearby countries 

our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks if there is a major terrorist attack confidence could be undermined potentially causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive 

our outlook assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports particularly in the asiapacific region our outlook includes a negative impact from the phaseout of the extraterritorial income exclusion as enacted by the american jobs creation act of 2004 our outlook assumes any other tax law changes will not negatively impact our provision for income taxes 

currency fluctuations 

the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations our outlook assumes no significant currency crises occur that could disrupt international trade or the competitiveness of our facilities should any crisis develop economic activity and our results could be negatively impacted 

the companys largest manufacturing presence is in the united states so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency costs to our end users and reduce our global competitiveness 

dealeroriginal equipment manufacturers inventory practices 

the company sells finished products through an independent dealer network or directly to original equipment manufacturers oem both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively the current outlook assumes no major changes in either dealer or oem inventory practices should dealers or oems decide to control inventories more tightly our sales would be lower 

financial products division factors 

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral additionally interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt our match funding policy addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio loans and leases with customers and dealers within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis to achieve our match funding objectives we issue debt with a similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated our financial results could be negatively impacted with respect to our insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

other factors 

the rates of infrastructure spending housing starts commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the companys results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted 

projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors these factors could include among other things higher than expected wages energy andor material costs andor higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions in which the alliances conduct their operations 

 

page 19 

results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties a failure to price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our 2006 sales outlook assumes that the company is successful in implementing worldwide machine price increases communicated to dealers with an effective date of january 2006 while we expect that the environment will absorb these price actions delays in the marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results moreover additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated realization 

our sales and results are generally sensitive to changes in economic growth particularly those originating in construction mining and energy developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales in addition to the factors mentioned above our sales and results could be negatively impacted by any of the following 

·   any sudden drop in consumer or business confidence 

·   delays in legislation needed to fund public construction 

·   regulatory or legislative changes that slow activity in key industries andor 

·   unexpected collapses in stock markets 

this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the companys actual results to differ from those currently anticipated

company strengths 

caterpillar is the leader in construction and mining equipment diesel and natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines in our size range annual sales and revenues top 30 billion making caterpillar the largest manufacturer in its industry caterpillar is also a leading us exporter with more than onehalf of its sales outside the united states through a global network of independent dealers caterpillar builds longterm relationships with customers around the world for over 75 years the caterpillar name has been associated with the highest level of quality products and services 

competitive environment 

caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets in all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price from time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit 

outside of the united states certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries

the competitive environment for caterpillars machinery business consists of global competitors regional competitors and specialized local competitors principal global competitors include komatsu volvo construction equipment part of the volvo group ab cnh global hitachi construction machinery john deere part of deere  co terex jcb and ingersollrand each has particular regional pockets of strength john deere construction and forestry division part of deere  co for example is a principal competitor in north america some competitors have broad ranges of products which compete with caterpillar others like ingersollrand only offer a limited range of products that compete with caterpillar 

during 2004 the machinery business in general enjoyed an increase in industry demand most of our competitors saw sales and operating profits improve from years of stagnant sales and difficult profitability the sharp industry upturn created supply chain challenges in addition to the material cost challenges of high commodity prices for all competitors several competitors continued to face distribution channel challenges asiabased competitors were impacted the most by the industry slowdown in china europebased competitors were most impacted by the strong euro most north americabased competitors benefited from the very strong north american industry upturn while the competitive environment in the machinery business continued to be intense the financial health of the industry as a whole improved

in the north america market heavyduty and midrange onhighway truck engine competitors continued to market emission certified engines meeting the january 1 2004 united states environmental protection agency epa emission limits using cooled exhaust gas recirculation technology egr in addition the industry continued to invest heavily in new technology to meet future on and offhighway emission regulations in north america europe and asia furthermore competitors formed or continued joint ventures and partnerships in an effort to share development costs strengthen customer relationships reach new markets and leverage core competencies moreover key component suppliers such as delphi corp bosch gmbh denso corp stanadyne corp and fleetguard inc part of cummins inc continued to play visible roles as emission technology drivers partners and key suppliers to the reciprocating engine business 

during 2004 caterpillar completed the introduction of its full line of acert® engines into the north america onhighway truck market and continued to maintain its leadership position in this market in addition caterpillar established itself as a leading provider of truck engines for the specialty bus and recreational vehicle rv markets customer acceptance of caterpillar acert engine performance quality and reliability is strong as a result of strong industry growth caterpillar experienced some heavyduty acert engines capacity constraints in 2004 

caterpillar also focused 2004 investment and resources on leveraging its success with acert engines in onhighway truck markets into offroad markets as well as the remainder of its engine platforms the building blocks for acert technology are very flexible and scaleable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application we have announced that 13 caterpillar machine models are being upgraded to acert engine technology and 6 of these 13 models are already shipping a full line of seven acert industrial engines has been released and plans are in place to leverage acert technology throughout caterpillars businesses and engine platforms we expect this to establish caterpillar as the first company to offer a full line of tier 3stage 3a emission compliant offhighway engines 

we believe acert provides caterpillar a competitive advantage now and in the future to meet emission and performance requirements and we plan to continue investing in developing and leveraging acert technology systems and components while caterpillar is able to leverage its acert technology directly into its offhighway businesses our competitors must pursue alternative technologies or further develop their existing technologies to meet offhighway market needs and emission requirements

the retail financing business is highly competitive with financing for users of caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies cat financials competitors include cit group citibank general electric capital corporation and local banks in addition many of our competitor manufacturers use belowmarket interest rate programs subsidized by the manufacturer to assist machine sales caterpillar and cat financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers 

cat financials results are largely dependent upon caterpillar dealers ability to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements with it it is also affected by the availability of funds from its financing sources and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates 

cat financial has a match funding policy whereby the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of its debt portfolio largely matches the interest rate profile of its receivable portfolio plus retained interests in securitized wholesale receivables within established guidelines in connection with that policy cat financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match these assets this match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move cat financial also uses these instruments to gain an economic andor competitive advantage through a lower cost of borrowed funds this is accomplished by changing the characteristics of existing debt instruments or entering into new agreements in combination with the issuance of new debt for more information regarding match funding please see note 3 on pages a12 and a13 of the appendix 

in managing foreign currency risk for cat financials operations the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions this policy allows the use of foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolio none of these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as a hedge

order backlog 

the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately 91 billion at december 31 2004 and 49 billion at december 31 2003 of the total backlog approximately 613 million at december 31 2004 and 320 million at december 31 2003 was not expected to be filled in the following year our backlog is generally highest in the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying trends in our industry 

dealers 

our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers dealer network  53 located in the united states and 145 located outside the united states worldwide these dealers serve 178 countries and operate 3324 places of business including 1437 dealer rental outlets reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins are also sold through a worldwide network of 170 distributors located in 150 countries most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by fg wilson are sold through a worldwide network of 250 dealers located in 170 countries 

these dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business turbines and large marine reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by solar turbines and mak respectively occasionally these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives 

the companys relationship with each independent dealer within the dealer network is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement pursuant to this agreement the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic region prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace the company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer the agreement further grants the dealer a nonexclusive license to the companys trademarks service marks and brand names 

in exchange for these rights the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers region each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market sell and promote the companys products demonstrate and exhibit the products perform the companys product improvement programs inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request 

these sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and terminate automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors 

 

patents and trademarks   

our products are sold primarily under the brands caterpillar cat design versions of cat and caterpillar solar turbines mak perkins fg wilson and olympian we own a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture which have been obtained over a period of years these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents

research and development 

we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2004 2003 and 2002 we spent 928 million 669 million and 656 million or 31 percent 29 percent and 33 percent of our sales and revenues respectively on our research and development programs 

employment 

as of december 31 2004 we employed 76920 persons of whom 38792 were located outside the united states from a global enterprise perspective we believe our relationship with our employees is very good we build and maintain a productive motivated workforce by treating all employees fairly and equitably 

in the united states most of our 38128 employees are atwill employees and therefore not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement at select business units certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits 

as of december 31 2004 there were 11465 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents 9450 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that will expire march 1 2011 the international association of machinists iam represents 1999 employees under labor agreements expiring on april 30 2005 and may 29 2005 based on our historical experience during periods when labor unrest or work stoppage by unionrepresented employees has occurred we do not expect that the occurrence of such events if any arising in connection with the expiration of these agreements will have a material impact on our operations or results 

outside the united states the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary the provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction 

sales 

sales outside the united states were 54 percent of consolidated sales for 2004  56 percent for 2003 and 55 percent for 2002  

environmental matters 

the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use of substances and control of emissions in all our operations compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

we are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is likely we will pay cleanup costs at a site and those costs can be estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in doing that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies and others 

the amount recorded for environmental cleanup is not material and is included in statement 3 on page a7 of the appendix under accrued expenses if a range of liability estimates is available on a particular site we accrue at the lower end of that range 

 

we cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of cleanup currently we have several sites in the very early stages of cleanup and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for cleanup at any individual site or at all sites in the aggregate will be required

pursuant to a consent decree caterpillar entered with the epa the company was required to meet certain emission standards by october 2002 the decree provides that if engine manufacturers were unable to meet the standards at that time they would be required to pay a nonconformance penalty ncp on each engine sold that did not meet the standard the amount of the ncp would be based on how close to meeting the standard the engine came  the more out of compliance the higher the penalty the company began introduction of fully compliant acert engines in 2003 and by the end of 2003 caterpillar was only producing fully compliant engine models as a result ncps were not payable for any engines built in 2004 ncps of 153 million were paid in 2003 

in addition the consent decree required caterpillar to pay a fine of 25 million which was expensed in 1998 and to make investments totaling 35 million in environmentalrelated products by july 7 2007 total qualifying investments to date for these projects are 349 million of which 59 million was made during 2004 caterpillar expects to reach the 35 million requirement during the first quarter of 2005 a future benefit is expected to be realized from these environmental projects related to caterpillars ability to capitalize on the technologies it developed in complying with its environmental project obligations in short caterpillar expects to receive a positive net return on the environmental projects by being able to market the technology it developed

we are a party to litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of our operations and while the results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty management believes based on the advice of counsel the final outcome of any single proceeding or all proceedings in the aggregate would not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows

world economic factors 

the world economy had its best recovery in years in 2004 and we expect that recovery to continue but at a somewhat slower pace in 2005 that outlook assumes central banks will cautiously raise interest rates so as not to slow growth too much low interest rates and continued good economic growth should encourage further growth in construction and mining should central banks raise interest rates aggressively both the world economic recovery and our machinery and engines sales likely would be weaker 

the us economy is growing at more than a three percent rate which up to now has not created an inflation problem while the federal reserve has raised interest rates we assume the continuation of moderate growth and low inflation will result in interest rates of no more than 35 percent by the end of 2005 longterm interest rates are expected to rise less than shortterm rates that environment should support further growth in construction and manufacturing helping to keep commodity prices favorable should financial conditions tighten noticeably causing economic growth to slow below 3 percent expected improvements in machinery and engines sales likely would be lower than projected 

our projection of increased sales of machinery and engines in europe africa middle east eame assumes that low interest rates will allow slightly faster economic growth in europe and that favorable commodity prices will extend healthy recoveries in both africa and middle east ame and the cis key risks are that the european central bank will raise interest rates sharply to reduce inflation or that commodity prices collapse those developments would negatively impact our results 

favorable commodity prices increased capital inflows and an improved foreign debt situation are expected to contribute to another year of economic recovery in latin america as a result we project that both mining production and construction spending will increase supporting an increase in machinery and engines sales this forecast is vulnerable to a significant weakening in commodity prices a slowing in world economic growth or widespread increases in interest rates 

in asiapacific we project sales growth in australia india and the developing asian economies will offset a further decline in china critical assumptions are continued growth in coal demand low domestic interest rates in most countries further gains in exports and continued good economic growth in china some developments that could lower expected results include reduced demand for thermal and coking coal significant revaluations of regional currencies restrictions on regional exports and sharp interest rate hikes particularly in china 

commodity prices 

commodities represent a significant sales opportunity with prices and production as key drivers prices have improved sharply over the past year and a half and our outlook assumes continued growth in world industrial production will cause metals prices to remain high enough in 2005 to encourage further mine investment any unexpected weakening in world industrial production however could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results 

 

page 16 

 

coal production and prices improved last year and our sales have benefited we expect these trends to continue in 2005 should coal prices soften due to a slowing in world economic growth or otherwise the ongoing sales recovery would be vulnerable 

oil and natural gas prices increased sharply over the past two years due to strong demand and high capacity usage higher energy prices did not halt economic recoveries last year since a strong demand boosted prices and world production increased high prices are encouraging more exploration and development and we expect increased production in 2005 will constrain price increases however should significant supply cuts occur such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country the resulting oil shortages and price spikes could slow economies potentially with a depressing impact on our sales 

monetary and fiscal policies 

for most companies operating in a global economy monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the united states and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth and accordingly demand for a product in general higher than expected interest rates reductions in government spending higher taxes excessive currency movements and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 

with economic data looking more favorable central banks in developed countries have started raising interest rates from the lowest rates in decades our outlook assumes that central banks will take great care to ensure that economic recoveries continue and that interest rates will remain low throughout the forecast period should central banks raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated both economic growth and our sales could suffer 

budget deficits in many countries have increased which has limited the ability of governments to boost economies with tax cuts and more spending our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect our sales 

political factors 

political factors in the united states and abroad can impact global companies our outlook assumes that no major disruptive changes in economic policies occur in either the united states or other major economies significant changes in either taxing or spending policies could reduce activities in sectors important to our businesses thereby reducing sales 

our outlook assumes that there will be no additional significant military conflicts in either north korea or the middle east in the forecast period such military conflicts could severely disrupt sales into countries affected as well as nearby countries 

our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks if there is a major terrorist attack confidence could be undermined potentially causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive 

our outlook assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports particularly in the asiapacific region our outlook includes a negative impact from the phaseout of the extraterritorial income exclusion eti as enacted by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act however our outlook does not include any impact from the provision of the act allowing preferential tax treatment of the repatriation of nonus earnings in 2005 further our outlook assumes any other tax law changes will not negatively impact our provision for income taxes 

currency fluctuations 

the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations our outlook assumes no significant changes in currency values from current rates should currency rates change sharply our results could be negatively impacted 

the companys largest manufacturing presence is in the united states so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency costs to our end users and reduce our global competitiveness 

 

 

page 17 

 

dealer practices 

the company sells primarily through an independent dealer network dealers carry inventories of both new and rental equipment and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively the current outlook assumes dealers will increase inventories in line with higher deliveries should dealers control inventories more tightly our sales would be lower

inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral additionally interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt our match funding policy manages interest rate risk by matching the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within certain parameters to achieve our match funding objectives we issue debt with similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated our financial results could be negatively impacted with respect to our insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings 

other factors 

the rate of infrastructure spending housing starts commercial construction and mining plays a significant role in the companys results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted 

projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors these factors could include among other things higher than expected wages energy andor material costs andor higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions in which the alliances conduct their operations 

as of december 31 2004 there were 11465 us hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw represents 9450 caterpillar employees under a sixyear central labor agreement that will expire march 1 2011 the international association of machinists iam represents 1999 employees under labor agreements expiring on april 30 2005 and may 29 2005 based on our historical experience during periods when labor unrest or work stoppage by unionrepresented employees has occurred we do not expect that the occurrence of such events if any arising in connection with the expiration of these agreements will have a material impact on our operations or results 

results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted 

the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties a failure to price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices 

page 18 

 

the environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint our 2005 sales outlook assumes that the company will be successful in implementing worldwide machine price increases communicated to dealers with an effective date of january 3 2005 while we expect that the environment will absorb these price actions delays in the marketplace acceptance would negatively impact our results moreover additional price discounting to maintain our competitive position could result in lower than anticipated price realization 

in general our results are sensitive to changes in economic growth particularly those originating in construction mining and energy developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales in addition to the factors mentioned above our results could be negatively impacted by any of the following 









this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the companys actual results to differ from those currently anticipated

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the company is a party to litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of its operations and while the results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty management believes based on the advice of counsel the final outcome of such matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position on january 16 2002 caterpillar commenced an action in the circuit court of the tenth judicial circuit of illinois in peoria illinois against navistar international transportation corporation and international truck and engine corporation collectively navistar the lawsuit arises out of a longterm purchase contract between caterpillar and navistar effective may 31 1988 as amended from time to time the purchase agreement the pending complaint alleges that navistar breached its contractual obligations by i paying caterpillar 808 whole dollars less per fuel injector than the agreed upon price for new unit injectors delivered by caterpillar ii refusing to pay contractually agreed upon surcharges owed as a result of navistar ordering less than planned volumes of replacement unit injectors and iii refusing to pay contractually agreed upon interest stemming from navistars late payments at december 31 2003 the past due receivable from navistar regarding the foregoing was 132 million the pending complaint also has claims alleging that franklin power products inc newstream enterprises and navistar collectively and individually failed to pay the applicable price for shipments of unit injectors to franklin and newstream at december 31 2003 the past due receivables for the foregoing totaled 12 million the pending complaint further alleges that sturman industries inc and sturman engine systems inc colluded with navistar to utilize technology that sturman industries inc misappropriated from caterpillar to help navistar develop its g2 fuel system and tortiously interfered with the purchase agreement and caterpillars prospective economic relationship with navistar the pending complaint further alleges that the two parties collusion led navistar to select sturman engine systems inc and another company instead of caterpillar to develop and manufacture the g2 fuel system on may 7 2002 international truck and engine corporation international commenced an action against caterpillar in the circuit court of dupage county illinois that alleges caterpillar breached various aspects of a longterm agreement term sheet in its fourth amended complaint international seeks a declaration from the court that the term sheet constitutes a legally binding contract for the sale of heavyduty engines at specified prices through the end of 2006 alleges that caterpillar breached the term sheet by raising certain prices effective october 1 2002 and also alleges that caterpillar breached an obligation to negotiate a comprehensive longterm agreement referenced in the term sheet international further claims that caterpillar improperly restricted the supply of heavyduty engines to international from june through september 2002 and claims that caterpillar made certain fraudulent misrepresentations with respect to the availability of engines during this time period international seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial and injunctive relief caterpillar filed an answer denying internationals claims and has filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the term sheet has been effectively terminated caterpillar denies internationals claims and will vigorously contest them on september 24 2003 the appellate court of illinois ruling on an interlocutory appeal issued an order consistent with caterpillars position that even if the court subsequently determines that the term sheet is a binding contract it is indefinite in duration and was therefore terminable at will by caterpillar after a reasonable period caterpillar anticipates that a trial currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2004 will address all remaining issues in this matter this matter is not related to the breach of contract action brought by caterpillar against navistar currently pending in the circuit court of peoria county illinois on august 30 2002 a world trade organization wto arbitration panel determined that the european union eu may impose up to 404 billion per year in retaliatory tariffs if the us tax code is not brought into compliance with an august 2001 wto decision that found the extraterritorial tax eti provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures since august 2002 the eu has developed a list of us origin products on which the eu could impose tariffs as high as 100 percent of the value of the product negotiations among eu member states the european commission and the private sector over which products would be listed were intense the eu finalized the list in december 2003 and stated that in march 2004 it will begin imposing retaliatory tariffs of 5 percent on certain us origin goods if imposed the tariffs would increase 1 percentage point per month to a maximum of 17 percent after one year the gradual increase in tariffs is designed to place increasing pressure on the us government to bring its tax laws into compliance with its wto obligations given the makeup of the final retaliation list some caterpillar parts and components will be subjected to these additional tariffs based on what we know today we do not believe these tariffs will materially impact our financial results the company has production facilities in the eu russia asia and south america that would not be affected by a retaliatory tariff aimed at us origin products when the eu implements its proposed tariffs increased pressure will be placed on congress to repeal eti possibly during the current session it is not possible to predict how the us legislative process will affect the companys 2004 income tax liability but based on what we know today we do not believe the impact if any will be material

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

information required by item 7 is incorporated by reference from pages a33 to a54 of the appendix

safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of 1995 certain statements contained in our managements discussion and analysis are forwardlooking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results the words believes expects estimates anticipates will be should and similar words or expressions identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves world economic factors a worldwide economic recovery is now underway and further strengthening should occur this year economic growth is expected to exceed 35 percent in 2004 or about 1 percentage point more than in 2003 low interest rates initiated economic recoveries and low inflation rates likely will encourage central bankers to be cautious about implementing any interest rate hikes if however central bankers decide to raise interest rates significantly the recovery would be less robust than assumed likely weakening machinery and engine sales

page 1 6 

the us economy ended 2003 on a strong note and the continuation of low interest rates in 2004 should ensure a very good year for the economy we project us growth of at least 45 percent and the canadian economy should rebound from 2003s slowdown growing more than 3 percent in 2004 this environment should allow the recovery in machinery and engines sales that developed last year to strengthen further this year low interest rates the tax cuts and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar have all helped the economy and our sales should any of these factors change substantially such as a significant increase in interest rates both economic growth and our sales probably would be weaker than assumed european economies recovered slowly in the last half of 2003 and current low interest rates should allow further strengthening this year we expect the european economies will grow 2 percent in 2004 fast enough to allow some improvement in construction activity favorable energy prices plus much higher commodity prices will promote another year of good economic growth in both africamiddle east and the cis as a result we project some improvement in eame sales in 2004 however the european recovery is fragile and developments such as a much stronger euro or modest interest rate hikes could cause economic growth to falter in that case the modest recovery in sales would be in jeopardy the japanese economy has grown for seven consecutive quarters and our outlook assumes that measures employed by the bank of japan  zero interest rates the maintenance of high levels of reserves in the banking system and the purchase of longterm government bonds  will allow this recovery to strengthen we project economic growth of 3 percent in 2004 up more than 12 percentage point from 2003 and the best year since 1996 the economy remains vulnerable to any tightening in financial conditions and should that occur the recovery could stall slower economic growth would further reduce our sales in that country and could have a negative impact on other economies particularly those in the region our outlook assumes that the asiapacific region will again lead the world in economic growth improving to over 6 percent growth in 2004 we expect chinas booming economy will slow a bit in response to modest tightening in economic policies but better growth in most other countries will more than pick up the slack strong domestic economies and low local interest rates will boost construction and the regions sizeable mining sector will benefit from higher prices the principal risks that could disrupt economic growth and our sales are significant policy tightening in china and intensified trade frictions that slow exports from the region we expect latin american economic growth to improve to about 35 percent in 2004 much better than the 15 percent rate experienced in 2003 we expect that the region will benefit from the worldwide economic recovery reductions in local interest rates and a rebound in foreign direct investment inflows better economic growth should boost our sales however should the economic recovery not materialize as expected our sales could continue to decline commodity prices commodities represent a significant sales opportunity with prices and production as key drivers prices have improved sharply over production the past year and our outlook assumes continued growth in the world economy will cause metals prices to increase further in 2004 any unexpected weakening in world industrial production however could cause prices to drop sharply to the detriment of our results while coals stocks are high and prices have been soft our outlook assumes production and prices will improve in 2004 if coal production and prices do not improve our results could be negatively affected oil and natural gas prices have continued fairly high into 2004 due to strong demand and tight inventories our outlook assumes that increased production will ease shortages in both oil and natural gas allowing prices to ease some we do not yet view higher energy prices as a threat to economies since it is strong demand that is boosting prices however should significant supply cuts occur such as from opec production cuts or political unrest in a major producing country the resulting price spikes likely would slow economies potentially with a depressing impact on our sales

page 1 7 

monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the us and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth and accordingly demand for a product in general higher than expected interest rates reductions in government spending higher taxes significant currency devaluations and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand while economic data are looking more favorable central banks in most developed countries are still holding interest rates steady two reserve bank of australia and bank of england have implemented modest interest rate increases our outlook assumes that central banks will take great care to ensure that economic recoveries continue and that interest rates will remain low throughout 2004 should central banks raise interest rates too aggressively both economic growth and our sales could suffer budget deficits in many countries have increased which has limited the ability of governments to boost economies with tax cuts and more spending our outlook assumes that governments will not aggressively raise taxes and slash spending to deal with their budget imbalances such actions could disrupt growth and negatively affect sales to public construction political factors political factors in the united states and abroad have a major impact on global companies our outlook assumes that there will be no significant military conflict in north korea or the middle east in the forecast period such a military conflict could severely disrupt sales into countries affected as well as nearby countries our outlook also assumes that there will be no major terrorist attacks if there is a major terrorist attack confidence could be undermined causing a sharp drop in economic activities and our sales attacks in major developed economies would be the most disruptive our outlook further assumes that efforts by countries to increase their exports will not result in retaliatory countermeasures by other countries to block such exports particularly in the asiapacific region currency fluctuations the company has costs and revenues in many currencies and is therefore exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations many currency positions are fairly closely balanced which along with the diversity of currency positions helps diminish exchange rate risks the companys largest manufacturing presence is in the united states so any unexpected strengthening of the dollar tends to raise the foreign currency value of costs and reduce our global competitiveness the stronger euro had a favorable impact on translating european sales into u s dollars for the full year the outlook assumes similar benefits in the future should the euro collapse our results could be negatively impacted dealer practices the company sells primarily through an independent dealer network dealers carry inventories of both new and rental equipment and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively the current outlook assumes dealers will reduce inventories slightly in 2004 more drastic reductions would adversely affect sales other factors the rate of infrastructure spending housing starts commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the companys results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the united states or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted the us government is under pressure by the world trade organization to repeal extraterritorial eti income tax benefits our outlook assumes that if eti is repealed we will not be materially impacted in 2004 due to the transition relief currently included in all bills under consideration by congress

pursuant to a consent decree caterpillar entered into with the epa the company was required to meet certain emission standards by october 2002 the consent decree provided for the possibility that diesel engine manufacturers may not be able to meet these standards exactly on that date and allows companies to continue selling noncompliant engines if they pay ncps on those engines the company began shipping lower emission onhighway engines in october 2002 as a bridge until the fully compliant acert engines were introduced in 2003 these bridge engines required the payment of ncps at yearend 2003 caterpillar was in production of all models of its medium heavyduty and heavyduty compliant acert engines therefore our outlook for 2004 assumes that we will not pay ncps beyond 2003 our outlook is also subject to assumptions regarding price increases and sales volumes our net price increase for heavyduty onhighway bridge engines was successfully implemented on october 1 2002 this increase was competitive with price increases implemented by other engine manufacturers on that date we implemented an additional price increase in 2003 to truck manufacturers that purchase our heavyduty acert engines and implemented a price increase on january 1 2004 for medium heavyduty acert engines these increases are based on the additional value that we expect truck owners to receive from acert engines compared to our competitors as a result of better fuel economy less maintenance and greater durability the ultimate net price increase we are able to achieve for our acert engines is dependent upon marketplace acceptance of these engines versus competitive alternatives while we estimate volume to the best of our ability industry volume is an issue out of our control if our assumptions regarding ncps market acceptance of the price increases andor engine volume are not realized company performance could be negatively impacted projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors these factors could include among other things higher than expected wages energy andor material costs andor higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales our results could be negatively impacted the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties a failure to price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices the environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization inherent in the operation of the financial products division is the credit risk associated with its customers the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including but not limited to relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral additionally interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt our match funding policy manages interest rate risk by matching the interest rate profile fixed rate or floating rate of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within certain parameters to achieve our match funding objectives we issue debt with similar interest rate profile to our receivables and also use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower our cost of borrowed funds if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated our financial results could be negatively impacted with respect to our insurance and investment management operations changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings

in general our results are sensitive to changes in economic growth particularly those originating in construction mining and energy developments reducing such activities also tend to lower our sales in addition to the factors mentioned above our results could be negatively impacted by any of the following

nature of operations

we conduct operations in our machinery and engines lines of business under highly competitive conditions including intense price competition we place great emphasis upon the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers service support although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of machines and engines there are numerous companies large and small which compete with us in the sale of each of our products

our financial products line of business also conducts business under highly competitive conditions financing for users of caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies we emphasize prompt and responsive service to meet customer requirements and offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company financial products activity is primarily conducted in the united states with additional offices in asia australia canada europe and latin america

information about our operations in 2000 and outlook for 2001 including risks associated with foreign operations are incorporated by reference from managements discussion and analysis on pages a22 through a30 of the appendix

acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2000 we reached an agreement with daimlerchrysler to create a global engine alliance to develop manufacture market and distribute mediumduty engines and fuel systems for sale to thirdparty customers and for captive use the alliance will create a mediumduty engine joint venture a fuel systems joint venture research and engineering cooperation and combined purchasing volume focused on procurement synergies the alliance is expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2001

during the second quarter of 1999 we acquired the remaining 51 interest in fg wilson fg wilson is a leading packager of dieselpowered generator sets during the first quarter of 1998 we acquired the net assets of perkins ltd and the stock of several related subsidiaries for 1328 billion perkins is a leading manufacturer of small to mediumsized engines both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

dealers machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers 63 located in the united states and 157 located outside the united states worldwide these dealers have over 2700 places of business including about 650 rental stores and serve 171 countries reciprocating engines are sold principally through the worldwide dealer organization and to other manufacturers for use in products manufactured by them some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by perkins are also sold through their worldwide distributor network our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products however in most cases sales and servicing of our products are our dealers principal business turbines and large marine reciprocating engines are sold through sales forces employed by solar and mak respectively occasionally these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives

patents and trademarks our products are sold primarily under the marks caterpillar cat design versions of cat and caterpillar solar mak perkins fg wilson and olympian we own a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture which have been obtained over a period of years these patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future we do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents

research and development we have always placed strong emphasis on productoriented research and engineering relating to the development of new or improved machines engines and major components in 2000 1999 and 1998 we spent 854 million 814 million and 838 million respectively on our research and engineering programs of these amounts 649 million in 2000 626 million in 1999 and 643 million in 1998 were attributable to new prime products major component development and major improvements to existing products the remainders were attributable to engineering

costs incurred during the early production phase as well as ongoing efforts to improve existing products employment at december 31 2000 we employed 68440 persons of whom 30780 were located outside the united states

sales sales outside the united states were 50 of consolidated sales for 2000 50 for 1999 and 49 for 1998

environmental matters the company is regulated by federal state and international environmental laws governing our use of substances and control of emissions compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

we are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations often with other companies pursuant to federal and state laws when it is likely we will pay cleanup costs at a site and those costs can be estimated the costs are charged against our earnings in doing that estimate we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies and others

the amount set aside for environmental cleanup is not material and is included in accrued expenses in statement 3 of the appendix if a range of liability estimates is available on a particular site we accrue the lower end of that range

we cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of cleanup currently we have five of these sites and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for cleanup will be required

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

information required by item 7 is incorporated by reference from managements discussion and analysis on pages a22 through a30 of the appendix

 

safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of 1995

certain statements contained in our managements discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results the words believes expects estimates anticipates will be and similar words or expressions identify forwardlooking statements made on behalf of caterpillar uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves

world economic factors our current outlook calls for a significant slowdown in growth in the us economy in early 2001 but growth is expected to pick up momentum in the second half of the year through 2002 should recent interest rate reductions fail to stimulate the us economy as expected leading to a more protracted slowdown or recession in 2001 then sales of machines and engines would decline sharply this year and could be negatively impacted in 2002 as well the outlook also projects that economic growth is expected to continue in asia pacific europe africa  middle east and latin america if for any reason these projected growth rates falter sales would likely be lower than anticipated in the affected region in general renewed currency speculation significant declines in the stock markets further oil or energy price increases political disruptions or much higher interest rates could result in weaker than anticipated economic growth and worldwide sales of both machines and engines could be lower than expected as a result

economic recovery could also be delayed or weakened by growing budget or current account deficits or inappropriate government policies in particular our outlook assumes that the japanese government remains committed to stimulating their economy with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies and that the brazilian government follows through with promised fiscal and structural reforms a reversal by either government could result in economic uncertainty and a weaker economy our outlook also assumes that currency and stock markets remain relatively stable and that world oil prices move down on average from the relatively elevated levels in the fourth quarter of 2000 if currency markets were to experience a significant increase in volatility andor stock markets were to decline significantly interest rates could move higher which would probably result in slower economic growth and lower sales in addition an eruption of political violence in the middle east could lead to oil supply disruptions and resumed upward pressure on oil prices in this case inflation pressures would move up again and interest rates would be higher than currently projected leading to slower world economic growth and potentially to lower company sales

the russian economy has improved but political and economic uncertainty remains high and an unexpected deterioration could impact worldwide stock or currency markets which in turn could weaken company sales

commodity prices the outlook for our sales also depends on commodity prices consistent with our outlook for moderate worldwide economic growth in 2001 although copper and aluminum prices are expected to be higher industrial metals prices as a whole are expected to be about flat on average in 2001 oil prices are expected to decline from an average of about 30 to 32 a barrel in 2000 to an average of 25 to 30 a barrel in 2001 agricultural prices are likely to be flat based on this forecast equipment sales into sectors that are sensitive to crude oil prices are expected to be up in 2001 industry sales to the industrial metals and agriculture equipment markets are expected to be about flat in 2001

weaker than anticipated world economic growth could lead to sharp declines in commodity prices and lower than expected sales into industrial metals oil and agriculture

monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the us and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth and accordingly demand for a product in the united states the federal reserve is expected to reduce the federal funds rate from current levels of 6 to a range of 5 to 55 in the second half of 2001 if the federal reserve does not lower rates accordingly and add sufficient liquidity to the banking system to generate the projected acceleration in growth in the second half of 2001 then machine and engine industry demand could be lower than expected potentially resulting in lower company sales similarly if the european central bank raises rates in 2001 then machine and engine demand in europe could be lower than expected

in general high interest rates reductions in government spending higher taxes significant currency devaluations and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand the current outlook is for slower us growth in 2001 but not a recession if for whatever reason the us were to enter a recession then demand for company products could fall in the us and canada and would also be lower throughout the rest of the world

political factors political factors in the us and abroad have a major impact on global companies the company is one of the largest us exporters as a percentage of sales international trade and fiscal policies implemented in the us this year could impact the companys ability to expand its business abroad us foreign relations with certain countries and any related restrictions imposed could also have a significant impact on foreign sales there are a number of significant expected political developments in latin america asia and europe africa and the middle east which are expected to take place in 2001 that could affect us trade policies andor destabilize local market conditions leading to lower company sales

currency fluctuations currency fluctuations are also an unknown for global companies the company has facilities in major sales areas throughout the world and significant costs and revenues in most major currencies this diversification greatly reduces the overall impact of currency movements on results however if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the conversion of net nonus dollar proceeds to us dollars would somewhat adversely impact the companys results further since the companys largest manufacturing presence is in the us a sustained overvalued dollar could have an unfavorable impact on our global competitiveness

dealer practices a majority of the companys sales are made through its independent dealer distribution network dealer practices such as changes in inventory levels for both new and rental equipment are not within the companys control primarily because these practices depend upon the dealers assessment of anticipated sales and the appropriate level of inventory and may have a significant positive or negative impact on our results in particular the outlook assumes that inventory to sales ratios will be somewhat lower at the end of 2001 than at the end of 2000 if dealers reduce inventory levels more than anticipated company sales will be adversely impacted

other factors the rate of infrastructure spending housing starts commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the companys results our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the us or abroad demand for our products may be significantly impacted in 1999 the sixyear federal highway bill did not boost us sales as much as anticipated due to delays in getting major capital projects for highways underway in 2000 there was a material increase in the volume of highway construction contracts which had a positive impact on sales of certain types of equipment if funding for highway construction in 2001 is delayed or is concentrated on bridge repair sales could be negatively impacted

projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors these factors could include among other things higher than expected wages energy andor materials costs andor higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in central bank interest rate policies cost savings could also be negatively impacted by unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations

results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales a reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties a failure to price the product competitively or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets

the environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization

this discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the companys actual results to differ from those currently anticipated
