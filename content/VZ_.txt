we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to consumer and business customers 

our direct channel including our companyoperated stores is a core component of our distribution strategy our sales and service centers and business direct sales teams also represent significant distribution channels for our services in addition we have a robust digital channel and omnichannel experience for our customers in order to offer choice and convenience 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the us as well as through the internet the majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also have relationships with highprofile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services as well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services 

in addition to our direct channel our business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by resellers nonstocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers 



the telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to remain intense as traditional and nontraditional participants seek increased market share 

with respect to our wireless connectivity products and services we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers including verizon and resell it to their customers resellers include cable companies and others competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market increased network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies including 5g the introduction of new products and services offerings that include additional bundled premium content increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts new market entrants the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory changes in addition increasing government incentives related to network deployment may enhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers and as mvnos resell wireless communication services in addition dish network has committed to deploy a facilitiesbased 5g broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70 percent of the us population by june 2023 which could result in additional competitive pressures in the us wireless industry 

we also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft corporation alphabet inc apple inc meta platforms inc and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content in addition we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low earth orbit satellite companies 

with respect to our wireline connectivity services we compete against cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop ott providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services while increasing their broadband internet footprint customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services we expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to ott offerings we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry 

• network reliability speed and coverage we consider networks that consistently provide highquality fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction lower prices improved service quality and new service offerings which in many cases include video content have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services we and other networkbased providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage 

• pricing with respect to wireless services and equipment pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape as the demand for wireless services continues to grow wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of verizon we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and some providers offer device leasing arrangements in addition aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as ip networking core voice and other legacy products in addition as nontraditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing for example voip and portalbased voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues 

• customer service we believe that highquality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers including those of other providers our customer service retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easytouse products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote longterm relationships and minimize churn 

customer service is highly valued by our business customers we provide global enterprise and public sector and other customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers we service our small and medium business customers through service representatives and online support as well as through storebased representatives for small business customers for wholesale customers we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives 

• product differentiation customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband video and wireless connections to compete effectively providers need to continuously review improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers we continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services both independently and in collaboration with application providers content providers and device manufacturers features such as wireless and wireline interoperability are becoming increasingly important driven by both customer demand and technological advancement 

• sales and distribution a key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points we seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our companyoperated stores selling wireless products and services webbased sales and fulfillment capabilities outside sales teams and telemarketing our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers which resell wireless services to their endusers 

in addition to these competitive factors and trends companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our business segment a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

in the small and medium business market customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumerlike look and feel are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full lifecycle offers that simplify the process of starting running and growing their businesses several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in the global enterprise and public sector and other markets competition levels remain high primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence we compete in this area with system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers in addition some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software defined networking communication applications and other computing tasks via networks rather than by the use of inhouse machines 

our wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity 



our global network architecture is used by consumer and business our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies 

network evolution 

we are transforming the architecture of our networks into our intelligent edge network providing improved efficiency and virtualization increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiberbased and radio access network technologies we expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements speed the deployment of 5g wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a costefficient manner 

5g deployment 

over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current fourthgeneration 4g lte technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows as of december 31 2021 5g ultra wideband is available in parts of 87 us cities and 5g home is available in parts of 65 us cities our fwa 

broadband service continued to grow during the year with a customer base of approximately 223 thousand as of december 31 2021 in january 2022 we successfully deployed cband spectrum reaching approximately 100 million people in the us as of february 2022 

5g nationwide uses low and midband spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing dss technology which allows 5g service to run simultaneously with 4g lte on multiple spectrum bands with dss whenever customers move outside verizon’s highband ultra wideband coverage area their 5genabled devices will remain on 5g technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5g nationwide network is available this allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4g and 5g customers 

4g lte 

the wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4g lte which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technology as of december 31 2021 our 4g lte network covers approximately 328 million people including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners under this program we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets with our core 4g lte equipment and 700 megahertz mhz c block and advanced wireless services aws spectrum lte home internet our home broadband internet service leverages the verizon 4g lte network 

wireless network reliability and buildout 

we consider the reliability coverage and speed of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services as we design and deploy our network we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network increasing the density of our network elements deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service 

we have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services on our 4g lte and 5g networks we are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience we continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates 

in order to build and upgrade our existing 4g lte network and deploy our 5g network we must secure rights to a large number of sites and obtain zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations we utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites 

our networks in the us include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the us where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the us 

fios 

residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years and we believe that demand will continue to grow we expect the continued emergence of new video services new data applications and the proliferation of ip devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput we believe that the passive optical network pon technology underpinning fios positions us well to meet these demands in a costeffective and efficient manner 

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network our pon infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the business segment especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services 

global ip 

verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiberoptic networks in the world providing connectivity to business customers in more than 180 countries our global ip network includes longhaul metro and submarine assets that enable and support international operations 

global business is rapidly evolving to an everythingasaservice model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services we are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice video and data communications services we are licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper cband and aws 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the us we have also deployed 4g technologies in 35 gigahertz ghz shared spectrum using ltecitizens broadband radio service and in 5 ghz unlicensed spectrum using ltelicensed assisted access all of this spectrum is collectively called low and midband spectrum we are using our low and midband spectrum to provide 3g 4g lte and 5g wireless services we are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3g service to provide 4g lte service we are also utilizing low and midband spectrum through dss for 5g to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 ghz band collectively called millimeter wave spectrum in 2021 we acquired an average of 161 mhz of new midband spectrum in the continental united states in the 37003980 mhz band also known as cband we began using cband for 5g service in january 2022 

millimeter wave spectrum is being used in conjunction with low and midband spectrum for our 5g technology deployment we own millimeter wave spectrum predominantly in the 28 ghz and 3739 ghz bands millimeter wave spectrum is currently being used to increase capacity for mobile and fixed wireless services in areas of high demand we anticipate that demand will continue to increase over time driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed as well as the wider deployment of 5g mobile and fixed services we expect to meet the demand for 4g and 5g spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets if demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur 

from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future in certain cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases require us to obtain governmental approvals 

information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries

regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market as described above some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

federal state and local regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight if demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service for example some states impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services the fcc currently recognizes broadband internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations however the fcc could return to a more utilitiesstyle regulation of broadband additionally a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of those cases related to regulations in california and vermont are being litigated in the courts regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpswwwverizoncomaboutourcompanyverizonbroadbandcommitment 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result

we are subject to local state federal and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including wireline wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the artificial intelligence and iot space at the federal level our business is governed by the fcc or the federal trade commission ftc depending on the product or service europes general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act which went into effect in january 2020 both include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition other states and countries have continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally and privacyrelated legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers the fcc is also addressing the use by american companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions in addition due to recent natural disasters federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters for example the california public utilities commission has imposed regulations on backup power for communications facilities 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate 

regulatory response to the covid19 pandemic 

since the time that covid19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020 verizon has been subject to various international federal state and local policies regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the world’s population in addition governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses including telecommunications companies can operate their business and interact with their customers because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing the impact of the crisis and the governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict

 item 1a risk factors tableend

the following discussion of risk factors identifies factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 



cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses distributed denial of services attacks ransomware attacks credential harvesting social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years they may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker the development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks that individually or in the aggregate have been material to verizons operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to our competitors the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack our presence in the iot industry which includes offerings of telematics products and services could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters extreme weather conditions or terrorist or other hostile acts could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages terrorist or other hostile acts natural disasters or the potential impacts of climate change including the increasing prevalence and intensity of hurricanes wildfires flooding hail and storms such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events we are implementing and will continue to implement measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption damage to our reputation and reduced profits 

public health crises including the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic which had an adverse effect on our operating results in 2020 our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to customers throughout the united states and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a crisis like the covid19 pandemic that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services the way our employees are able to provide services to our customers and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products and services to us for example public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 and initiatives verizon took in response to the health crisis to promote the health and safety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers along with the related 

global slowdown in economic activity resulted in decreased revenues increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020 in addition such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships risks of an economic slowdown regulatory risks and the costs and availability of financing because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing the impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict in addition the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations depends on many factors including those discussed above that are not within our control 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as fiber switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend these suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including for example disruption to the global supply chain as a result of geopolitical factors the covid19 pandemic natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change if such failures occur we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 1 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 240 of our workforce is represented by the communications workers of america or the international brotherhood of electrical workers while we have labor contracts in place with these unions with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations in addition while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by unions for bargaining we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations 



we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industries the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telecommunications companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers technology companies and application and device providers while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

————————————————— 

1 workforce profile metrics do not include employees who joined verizon in connection with the acquisition of tracfone in november 2021 

if we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis or if the deployment of our 5g network is delayed or hindered for any reason we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet 

future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market if our new services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition the deployment of our 5g network is subject to a variety of risks including those related to equipment and spectrum availability unexpected costs and regulatory matters that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues these issues could result in significant costs put us at a competitive disadvantage or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks 

as we introduce new offerings and technologies such as 5g technology we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or elsewhere or inflation in the markets in which we operate could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and our cost of doing business in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services dropping down in price plans or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 



changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level such as those described below those that incentivize business models or technologies different from ours or requirements limiting our ability to discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our businesses impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers 

• privacy and data protection  we are subject to federal state and international laws related to privacy and data protection europes general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act which went into effect in january 2020 both include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition other states and countries have continued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally and privacyrelated legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses 

• regulation of broadband internet access services  in its 2015 title ii order the fcc nullified its longstanding light touch approach to regulating broadband internet access services and reclassified these services as telecommunications services subject to utilitiesstyle common carriage regulation the fcc repealed the 2015 title ii order in december 2017 and returned to its traditional lighttouch approach for these services the 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the dc circuit but may be revisited by the fcc or by congress several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that 

would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services in some cases different from the fcc’s 2015 rules although some of these have been challenged in court the ultimate enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain 

• open access  we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice moreover certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services 

• climaterelated regulation and policy – due to the nature of our operations we may be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change including for example the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions in addition policydriven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels 

these developments and the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims property claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 



verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2021 verizon had approximately 1367 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness 94 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and 142 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal interest and other amounts payable on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures dividend payments and acquisitions 

• making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements debt refinancing acquisitions or other purposes 

• reducing verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions 

• making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business and 

• exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates 

adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our ability to obtain funding under assetbacked debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized our borrowing costs also can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 118400 employees including approximately 800 tracfone employees and approximately 187000 retirees as of december 31 2021 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits 

have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments

capital expenditures and investments 

we continue to invest in our wireless networks highspeed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future during the year ended december 31 2021 these investments included 203 billion for capital expenditures inclusive of approximately 21 billion in cband related capital expenditures see cash flows used in investing activities and liquidity and capital resources for additional information we believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy 

global network and technology 

we are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4g longterm evolution lte network while also building our next generation 5g network we are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services on our 4g lte and 5g networks over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4g lte technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows as of december 31 2021 5g ultra wideband is available in parts of 87 us cities and 5g home is available in parts of 65 us cities 5g nationwide uses low and midband spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing dss technology which allows 5g service to run simultaneously with 4g lte on multiple spectrum bands with dss whenever customers move outside verizon’s highband ultra wideband coverage area their 5genabled devices will remain on 5g technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5g nationwide network is available this allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4g and 5g customers 

to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copperbased products we continue to build fiberbased networks supporting data video and advanced business services  areas where demand for reliable highspeed connections is growing we are transforming the architecture of our networks into our intelligent edge network providing improved efficiency and virtualization increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiberbased and radio access network technologies we expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements speed the deployment of 5g wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a costefficient manner 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the impacts from the covid19 pandemic on our operations were significant during 2020 which affects the comparability of the results from 2021 to 2020 the covid19 pandemic continues to be dynamic and nearterm challenges across the economy remain including the recent surge of new virus variants across the us we remain committed to caring for the health and safety of our employees and our customers through this challenge while supporting the communities in which we operate while we have not experienced a material impact on our business from these new variants thus far we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations in the future and will continue to monitor their daily evolution for a discussion of the risks to our business from covid19 refer to item 1a risk factors

consolidated revenues 



consolidated revenues increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due to increases in our consumer and business segments partially offset by a decrease in corporate and other 

corporate and other revenues decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease of 17 billion within verizon media we had four less months of operating revenues from verizon media as a result of the sale completed on september 1 2021 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the verizon media sale 

revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading segment results of operations 

consolidated operating expenses 



operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading segment results of operations 

cost of services 

cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service salaries and wages benefits materials and supplies content costs contracted services network access and transport costs customer provisioning costs computer systems support costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities and traffic acquisition costs aggregate customer service costs which include billing and service provisioning are allocated between cost of services and selling general and administrative expense 

cost of services decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to 

• a decrease of 576 million in traffic acquisition primarily related to the sale of verizon media 

• a decrease of 294 million in personnel costs primarily related to the sale of verizon media 

• a decrease of 220 million in access costs primarily related to a decline in voice services offset by the inclusion of tracfone results since the acquisition date  

• an increase of 349 million in rent expense related to both adding capacity to the networks to support demand and lease modifications for certain existing cell towers to support the build out of our 5g wireless network 

• an increase of 205 million related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid customers 

• an increase of 185 million in buildings and facilities costs primarily driven by higher utility rates and

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of verizon media 

cost of wireless equipment 

cost of wireless equipment increased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to 

• an increase of 36 billion related to a shift to higher priced equipment in the mix of wireless devices sold  partly driven by the increased demand for 5g enabled devices  and 

• an increase of 13 billion driven by a higher volume of wireless devices and accessories sold

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on both the sale of verizon media and loss on spectrum licenses 

depreciation and amortization expense 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 p rimarily as a result of the verizon media sale see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  

other consolidated results 

other income expense net 

additional information relating to other income expense net is as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

other income expense net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations including interest income gains and losses from nonoperating asset dispositions debt extinguishment costs components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and income and foreign exchange gains and losses 

other income expense net changed during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to 

• a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gain of 24 billion recorded during 2021 compared with a net pension and postretirement benefits remeasurement loss of 16 billion recorded during 2020 and 

• an increase of 34 billion in early debt redemption costs driven by tender offers the redemptions of securities issued by verizon and open market repurchases of verizon and subsidiary notes in 2021 

interest expense 



nm  not meaningful 

1 the average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteenmonth end balances of total shortterm and longterm debt net of discounts premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs 

2 the effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt it is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding 

3 we believe that this measure is useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management 

total interest expense decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 and was primarily due to 

• an increase in capitalized interest costs as a result of qualifying activities performed on cband licenses won and 

• an increase in interest costs on debt balances as a result of higher average debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates as a result of our continuing focus on optimizing our debt footprint and total borrowing costs 

see note 4 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on spectrum licenses and debt transactions respectively 

provision for income taxes 



the effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the sale of verizon media in the current period partially offset by the nonrecurring tax benefit recognized in 2020 from a series of legal entity restructurings the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes in the current period 

a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

consolidated net income consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda 

consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization expenses consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda which are presented below are nongenerally accepted accounting principles gaap measures that we believe are useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to verizon’s competitors consolidated ebitda is calculated by adding back interest taxes depreciation and amortization expenses to net income 

consolidated adjusted ebitda is calculated by excluding from consolidated ebitda the effect of the following nonoperational items equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense net as well as the effect of special items we believe that this measure is useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance we believe that consolidated adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure taxes and depreciation and amortization policies further the exclusion of nonoperational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis see special items for additional information 

it is management’s intent to provide nongaap financial information to enhance the understanding of verizon’s gaap financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to but not instead of the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap each nongaap financial measure is presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as not to imply that more emphasis 

should be placed on the nongaap measure we believe that providing these nongaap measures in addition to the gaap measures allows management investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance the nongaap financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies 



1 includes early debt redemption costs where applicable see special items for additional information 

2 includes pension and benefits marktomarket adjustments and early debt redemption costs where applicable see special items for additional information 

3 includes net gains from dispositions of assets where applicable see special items for additional information 

the changes in consolidated net income consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda in the table above during 2021 compared to 2020 were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses 



we have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units  consumer and business we measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income the use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance 

to aid in the understanding of segment performance as it relates to segment operating income management uses the following operating statistics to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our segments we believe these operating statistics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information because they provide additional insight into drivers of our segments’ operating results key trends and performance relative to our peers these operating statistics may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to those statistics of other companies

with respect to wireless services and equipment pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape we compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price as the demand for wireless services continues to grow wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices these service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers 

we expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans driven in part by attractive bundled content with premium brands as well as from increased connections per account future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and some providers offer device leasing arrangements 

current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

despite this challenging environment we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services we continue to provide network reliability and offer products which include fiberoptic internet access several video services and voice services further we will continue to offer our business and government customers more robust ip products and services and advance our iot strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity platform and solution layers 

we will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and economic environments and maximize returns to shareholders 

2022 connection trends 

in our consumer segment we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain highquality retail postpaid customers capitalizing on demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives we expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones tablets and other connected devices such as wearables we believe the combination of our wireless network performance and mix  match unlimited plans provides a superior customer experience supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections we anticipate continued pressure in 2022 related to tracfone subscribers as we seek to improve the customer retention rate that has declined over the prior two years however expect to grow the tracfone customer base over time by furthering our investment and increasing our product and service offerings within the business we expect to manage churn by providing a consistent reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and continued focus in our distribution channels we expect to continue to grow our fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our fios service areas further supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections at the same time we expect accelerating fixed wireless access connections to complement strong fios results as demand for services continues to grow in fios video the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market we expect to manage market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service including options such as mix  match on fios and other offerings we have experienced continuing access line and dsl losses as customers have disconnected both primary 

and secondary lines and switched to alternative technologies such as wireless voice over internet protocol and cable for voice and data services 

in our business segment we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the us we continue to grow our retail connections while operating in a competitive environment we expect that this connection growth combined with our industryleading network assets will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions such as those around security advanced communications and professional services we also expect to expand our existing services offered to business customers through our intelligent edge network our multiuse platform 

in addition in both our consumer and our business segments we expect to support connection growth in part by adding capacity and density to our 4g lte network and by leading the buildout of our 5g network we also anticipate the continued migration of 3g connections onto 4g and 5g technologies with the expected cessation of 3g services 

2022 operating revenue trends 

in our consumer segment we expect to see a continuation of service revenue growth in 2022 as customers shift to higher access plans with additional services and increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services we expect continued growth in wireless service revenue driven by tracfone contributions migrations to higher priced plans and increases in fixed wireless access connections we expect fios revenue to benefit in 2022 as growth in our broadband customer base and increases in demand for higher speed internet connections offsets the impact of the shift from the tripleplay bundle to standalone service 

in our business segment we expect wireless revenue to expand driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed wireless access contributions we expect that fios through increased penetration will also contribute to revenue growth legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures 

on september 1 2021 we completed the sale of verizon media we expect to see a decrease in operating revenues as a result of this divestiture 

2022 operating expense and cash flow from operations trends 

we expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated ebitda margin to remain strong as we continue to drive revenue growth and undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2022 and beyond business excellence initiatives include zerobased budgeting methodology driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks and evolving our information technology strategy we believe our additional investments in our business segment in both product simplification and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5g and one fiber 

we create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services in addition we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders verizon’s board of directors increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 20 during 2021 making this the fifteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend 

our goal is to use our cash to create longterm value for our shareholders we will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business strengthen our balance sheet acquire spectrum licenses see cash flows from investing activities pay dividends to our shareholders and when appropriate buy back shares of our outstanding common stock see cash flows from financing activities 



we use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks service and repay external financing pay dividends invest in new businesses and spectrum and when appropriate buy back shares of our outstanding common stock our sources of funds primarily from operations and to the extent necessary from external financing arrangements are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond 

our cash and cash equivalents balance is 29 billion as of december 31 2021 consistent with historical prepandemic levels our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity see market risk for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies 

we expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities such as the completion of business acquisitions the acquisition of additional wireless spectrum or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility our available external financing arrangements include an active commercial paper program credit available under credit facilities and other bank lines of credit vendor financing arrangements issuances of registered debt or equity securities us retail mediumterm notes and other capital market securities that are privatelyplaced or offered overseas in addition we monetize our device payment plan agreement receivables through assetbacked debt transactions 

capital expenditures 

our 2022 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services including expanding our core networks adding capacity and density to our 5g network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying cband transforming our structure to deploy the intelligent edge network while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies we expect that the new network architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements improve our 4g lte coverage speed the deployment of 5g technology and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market we anticipate cash requirements for our 2022 capital program to be between 165 billion and 175 billion furthermore we expect an additional 50 billion to 60 billion in capital expenditures related to cband as we continue to build out the initial markets and begin preparations for deploying phase two spectrum

cash flows provided by operating activities 

our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 22 billion during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to changes in working capital which includes higher wireless volumes and slightly higher cash taxes in 2021 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings of 43 billion as a result of prior years discretionary contributions and the fact that actual asset returns have been higher than expected we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2031 subject to changes in market conditions

longterm credit facilities 



na  not applicable 

1 the revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change the revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit  

2 during both 2021 and 2020 we drew down 10 billion from these facilities respectively these credit facilities are used to finance equipmentrelated purchases borrowings under certain of these facilities amortize semiannually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed 

in november 2021 we repaid 500 million under an export credit facility entered into in july 2017 

common stock 

common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we issued 21 million and 23 million common shares from treasury stock respectively which had an insignificant aggregate value 

in connection with our acquisition of tracfone in november 2021 we issued approximately 576 million shares of verizon common shares from treasury stock valued at approximately 30 billion see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in february 2020 the verizon board of directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of verizons common stock the program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized whichever is sooner the program permits verizon to repurchase shares over time with the 

amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs there were no repurchases of common stock during 2021 and 2020 under our current or previously authorized share buyback program 

credit ratings 

verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2021 or 2020 

securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold securities a securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

covenants 

our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large investment grade companies these covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion pay taxes maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies preserve our corporate existence keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions maintain our properties provide financial and other reports to our lenders limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations and other similar covenants 

we and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 

change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 totaled 29 billion a 193 billion decrease compared to december 31 2020 primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 

restricted cash at december 31 2021 totaled 12 billion an 87 million decrease compared to restricted cash at december 31 2020 primarily related to cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe when viewed with our gaap results provides management investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures including capitalized software from net cash provided by operating activities we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



the decrease in free cash flow during 2021 is a reflection of the decrease in operating cash flows as well as the increase in capital expenditures discussed above 

employee benefit plans funded status and contributions 

employer contributions 

we operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans these plans primarily relate to our domestic business units we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2021 or 2020 during 2021 and 2020 we made contributions of 58 million and 57 million to our nonqualified pension plans respectively 

the company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return in an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability we expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase referred to as liability hedging with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries however we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately 60 million in 2022 

contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an asincurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans we contributed 885 million and 709 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 and 2020 respectively contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately 860 million in 2022

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows 

wireless licenses and goodwill 

wireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinitelived intangible assets and therefore are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators are present we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature may change over time and can vary from actual results it is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions including the timing and amount of future cash flows margins growth rates market participant assumptions comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates which could result in different fair value estimates significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the abovenoted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units 

wireless licenses 

the carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately 1476 billion as of december 31 2021 we aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses 

we test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test however we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test it is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed a quantitative impairment assessment according to the policy 

our quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated carrying amount as of the test date under our quantitative assessment we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the greenfield approach the greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical startup company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued a discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless licenses as of the valuation date as a result we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability specifically associated with our wireless licenses an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows 

and assumed terminal value and growth rates we considered current and expected future economic conditions current and expected availability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in estimating future cash flows and profitability the discount rate represented our estimate of the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc or expected return that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date we developed the discount rate based on our consideration of the cost of debt and equity of a group of guideline companies as of the valuation date accordingly our discount rate incorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date including the risk premium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date the terminal value growth rate represented our estimate of the marketplace’s longterm growth rate 

the quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses is substantially in excess of their carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment in the event of a 10 decline in the fair value of our wireless licenses the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value we do not believe reasonable changes in significant estimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment for instance if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis points bps or if the wacc increased by 50 bps the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount as part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business macroeconomic conditions including changes in interest rates and discount rates industry and market considerations including industry revenue and ebitda margin results projections and recent merger and acquisition activity the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole as well as other factors our annual impairment tests in 2020 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment 

goodwill 

to determine if goodwill is potentially impaired we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit being assessed it is our policy to perform quantitative impairment assessments at least every three years during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed quantitative impairment assessments for our consumer and business reporting units according to the policy 

under the qualitative assessment we consider several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test macroeconomic conditions including changes in interest rates and discount rates industry and market considerations including industry revenue and ebitda margin results projections and recent merger and acquisition activity the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit as well as other factors 

under our quantitative assessment the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method as a form of the income approach the market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results the discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two componentsprojected cash flows and a terminal value the terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value the discount rate represented our estimate of the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc or expected return that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date the application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model the discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives as well as revenue and ebitda growth relative to history and market trends and expectations the market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks the selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profitability and volatility in market prices of peer companies these valuation inputs are inherently judgmental and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future 

a projected sustained decline in a reporting units revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges such a decline could be driven by among other things 1 more than anticipated increase in promotional activity decreases in sales volumes or longterm growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors or 2 the inability to achieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives also adverse changes to macroeconomic factors such as increases to longterm interest rates would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit 

at december 31 2021 the balance of our goodwill was approximately 286 billion of which 210 billion was in our consumer reporting unit and 75 billion was in our business reporting unit at the goodwill impairment measurement date of october 31 2021 our quantitative assessments indicate that the fair values for our consumer and business reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment in the event of a 10 decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units the fair value of each of our reporting units would have still exceeded their book values we do not anticipate reasonable changes in significant estimates to change the outcomes to these quantitative impairment assessments for instance if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 bps or if the wacc increased by 50 bps the fair values of our reporting units would still exceed their respective carrying values 

at december 31 2020 the balance of our goodwill was approximately 248 billion of which 172 billion was in our consumer reporting unit and 75 billion was in our business reporting unit we performed qualitative impairment assessments for our consumer and business 

reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020 our qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our consumer and business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

we maintain benefit plans for most of our employees including for certain employees pension and other postretirement benefit plans benefit plan assumptions including the discount rate used the longterm rate of return on plan assets the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income expense assets and obligations changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits 

in determining pension and other postretirement obligations the weightedaverage discount rate was selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of highquality bonds available in the market at december 31 2021 the bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur were noncallable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability at least 300 million par outstanding bond yields are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance credit rating downgrades and upgrades government fiscal policy decisions and general market volatility the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets used in determining the company’s pension and other postretirement obligations are based on expectations for future investment returns for the plans’ asset allocation the rates are subject to uncertainty for a number of reasons including corporate performance credit ratings monetary policy inflation exchange rates investor behavior and general market volatility 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets on the benefit obligations and expense income recorded as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of december 31 2021 and for the year then ended pertaining to verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans is provided in the table below 



the annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is december 31 we use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits the full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date these individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost

income taxes 

our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards changes in tax laws and rates acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and nonrecurring items as a global commercial enterprise our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments we account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes which requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts circumstances and information available at each reporting date to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments we recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

property plant and equipment 

our property plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets we record property plant and equipment at cost we depreciate property plant and equipment on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets the estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or performance technical obsolescence market expectations and competition impacts in connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment during 2021 we determined that the estimated useful life of our property plant and equipment would remain unchanged we expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2021 depreciation expense of 22 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately 35 billion in our 2021 depreciation expense 

accounts receivable 

prior to january 1 2020 accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts the gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets we maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable including our directchannel device payment plan agreement receivables for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments indirectchannel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest and credit losses were recorded as incurred however receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired subsequent to january 1 2020 accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered the gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets we maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments we recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability the allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the credit quality of the customer base the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions such as the covid19 pandemic as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future if applicable the impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics 

we record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible for device payment plan agreement receivables we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model the expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above the loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weightedaverage loss rate used for determining the allowance balance the weightedaverage expected loss rate decreased 081 at december 31 2021 as compared to at december 31 2020 we expect that an increase or decrease of 025 in the weightedaverage loss rate would result in a change of 94 million in the allowance 

we monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups consumer small and medium business global enterprise public sector and wholesale for wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average writeoff balance multiplied by the average lifecycle of an account from billing to writeoff the risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations for global enterprise public sector and wholesale wireline receivables the allowance for credit losses is based on historical writeoff experience and individual customer credit risk if applicable we consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above 

if there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 



spectrum license transactions 

from time to time we enter into agreements to buy sell or exchange spectrum licenses we believe these spectrum license transactions have allowed us to continue to enhance the reliability of our wireless network while also resulting in a more efficient use of spectrum 

in march 2020 the fccs incentive auction auction 103 for spectrum licenses in the upper 37 ghz 39 ghz and 47 ghz bands concluded verizon participated in this incentive auction and was the high bidder on 4940 licenses which primarily consisted of 37 ghz and to a lesser extent 39 ghz spectrum as an incumbent licensee our 39 ghz licenses provided us with incentive payments that were applied towards the purchase price of spectrum in the auction the value of the licenses won by verizon amounted to 34 billion of which 18 billion was settled with the relinquished 39 ghz licenses the new reconfigured licenses were received in the second quarter 2020 and are included in wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets 

in september 2020 the fcc completed auction 105 for priority access licenses verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder on 557 licenses in the 35 ghz band valued at approximately 19 billion verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 and received them from the fcc in march 2021 the purchase cost for these licenses and related capitalized interest based on qualifying activities that occurred are included in wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheets

incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for verizon’s use and therefore the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders’ execution of their clearing process in accordance with the fcc order the clearing must be completed by december 2025 the carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in auction 107 will consist of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction including verizon’s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by and incentive payments due to the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses carrying value will also include capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred the licenses were received from the fcc in july 2021 and are included within wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business including the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in investment equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates we employ risk management strategies which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps forward starting interest rate swaps interest rate swaps interest rate caps treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

it is our general policy to enter into interest rate foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions we do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings 

counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements isda master agreements and credit support annex csa agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange the csa agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value at december 31 2021 we held and posted 01 billion and an insignificant amount respectively of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements which were recorded as other current liabilities and prepaid expenses and other respectively in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 we held 02 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements which were recorded as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet while we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio 



we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and the portion of longterm debt that carries floating interest rates as of december 31 2021 approximately 81 of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixedrate indebtedness including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges of approximately 288 million the interest rates on our existing longterm debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings 

certain of our floating rate debt and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor as the benchmark rate libor is the subject of recent us and international regulatory guidance for reform the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor rates ceased publication after december 31 2021 and other us dollar libor rates will cease publication after june 30 2023 the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging the floating rate senior unsecured notes issued in march 2021 and certain of our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to the secured overnight financing rate as the benchmark rate 

the table that follows summarizes the fair values of our longterm debt including current maturities and interest rate swap derivatives as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100basispoint upward and downward shifts in the yield curve our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans if any because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates

table of contents 



the telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to remain intense as traditional and nontraditional participants seek increased market share 

with respect to our wireless connectivity products and services we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers including verizon and resell it to their customers resellers include cable companies and others competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market increased network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies such as 5g the introduction of new products and services offerings that include additional bundled premium content new market entrants the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers and as mvnos resell wireless communication services in addition dish network has committed to deploy a facilitiesbased 5g broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70 percent of the us population by june 2023 which could result in additional competitive pressures in the us wireless industry 

we also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft corporation alphabet inc apple inc and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

with respect to our wireline connectivity services we compete against cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop ott providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services we expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to ott offerings we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry 

• network reliability speed and coverage we consider networks that consistently provide highquality fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction lower prices improved service quality and new service offerings which in many cases include video content have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services we and other networkbased providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage 

• pricing with respect to wireless services and equipment pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape as the demand for wireless services continues to grow wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of verizon we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and some providers offer device leasing arrangements in addition aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as ip networking core voice and other legacy products in addition as nontraditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing for example voip and portalbased voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues 

• customer service we believe that highquality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers including those of other providers our customer service retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easytouse products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote longterm relationships and minimize churn 

customer service is highly valued by our business customers we provide global enterprise and public sector and other customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers we service our small and medium business customers through service representatives and online support as well as through storebased representatives for small business customers for wholesale customers we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives 

• product differentiation customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband video and wireless connections to compete effectively providers need to continuously review improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly 

table of contents 

deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers we continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services both independently and in collaboration with application providers content providers and device manufacturers features such as wireless and wireline interoperability are becoming increasingly important driven by both customer demand and technological advancement 

• sales and distribution a key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points we seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our companyoperated stores selling wireless products and services outside sales teams and telemarketing webbased sales and fulfillment capabilities our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers which resell wireless services to their endusers 

in addition to these competitive factors and trends companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our business segment a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

in the small and medium business market customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumerlike look and feel are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full lifecycle offers that simplify the process of starting running and growing their businesses several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in the global enterprise and public sector and other markets competition levels remain high primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence we compete in this area with system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers in addition some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software defined networking communication applications and other computing tasks via networks rather than by the use of inhouse machines 

our wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity

our global network architecture is used by consumer business and verizon media our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies 

network evolution 

we are evolving the architecture of our networks to a nextgeneration multiuse platform providing improved efficiency and virtualization increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiberbased and radio access network technologies we call this the intelligent edge network we expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements speed the deployment of 5g wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost efficient manner 

5g deployment 

over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current fourthgeneration 4g lte technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows as of december 31 2020 we have launched our 5g ultra wideband network in 61 us markets we have commercially launched 5g home in 12 of those markets 

we also launched our 5g nationwide network in october 2020 which is available in over 2700 cities across the us covering approximately 230 million people 5g nationwide uses low and midband spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing dss technology which allows 5g service to run simultaneously with 4g lte on multiple spectrum bands with dss whenever customers move outside verizon’s highband ultra wideband coverage area their 5genabled devices will remain on 5g technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5g nationwide network is available this allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4g and 5g customers 

4g lte 

the wireless network technology platform that carries the majority of our wireless traffic is 4g lte which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technology as of december 31 2020 our 4g lte network is available in over 700 markets covering approximately 327 million people including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners under this program we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets with our core 4g lte equipment and 700 megahertz mhz c block and advanced wireless services aws spectrum in 2020 we launched lte home internet a home broadband internet service that leverages the verizon 4g lte network 

wireless network reliability and buildout 

we consider the reliability coverage and speed of our wireless network to be key factors for our continued success we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services as we design and deploy our network we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network increasing the density of our network elements deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service 

we have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services on our 4g lte and 5g networks we are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience we continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates 

in order to build and upgrade our existing 4g lte network and deploy our 5g network we must complete a variety of steps which can include securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations we utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites 

our networks in the us include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup 

table of contents 

generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the us where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the us 

fios 

residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years and we believe that demand will continue to grow we expect the continued emergence of new video services new data applications and the proliferation of ip devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput we believe that the passive optical network pon technology underpinning fios positions us well to meet these demands in a costeffective and efficient manner 

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network our pon infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the business segment especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services 

global ip 

verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiberoptic networks in the world providing connectivity to business customers in more than 180 countries our global ip network includes longhaul metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations 

global business is rapidly evolving to an everythingasaservice model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services we are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice video and data communications services we are licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the us we have also deployed 4g technologies in 35 gigahertz ghz shared spectrum using ltecitizens broadband radio service and in 5 ghz unlicensed spectrum using ltelicensed assisted access all of this spectrum is collectively called low and midband spectrum we are using our low and midband spectrum to provide 3g 4g lte and 5g wireless services we are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3g service to provide 4g lte service we are also utilizing low and midband spectrum through dss for 5g to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 ghz band collectively called millimeter wave spectrum 

millimeter wave and low and midband spectrum are being used for our 5g technology deployment we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed as well as the wider deployment of 5g mobile and fixed services we can meet our future 4g and 5g spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur 

from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future in certain cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases require us to obtain governmental approvals 

information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries

regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market as described above some of our competitors are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

table of contents 

federal state and local regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service for example some states impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services the fcc recognizes broadband internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations however a number of states have taken steps to regulate broadband and two of those cases related to regulations in california and vermont are being litigated in the courts regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpswwwverizoncomaboutourcompanyverizonbroadbandcommitment 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to local state federal and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including wireline wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the media and iot space at the federal level our voice business is subject to the fccs privacy requirements oversight of broadband internet access privacy and data security is governed by the federal trade commission ftc europes general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act which went into effect in january 2020 both include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition other new privacy laws took effect in 2020 including in brazil and maine generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of government globally and privacyrelated legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could 

table of contents 

occur in the future however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers the fcc is also addressing the use by american companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national security risks verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions in addition due to recent natural disasters federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters for example the california public utilities commission has imposed regulations on backup power for communications facilities 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate 

regulatory response to the covid19 pandemic 

since the time that covid19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020 verizon has been subject to various international federal state and local policies regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the world’s population in addition governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses including telecommunications companies can operate their business and interact with their customers because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing the impact of the crisis and the governmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2021 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict

 item 1a risk factors tableend

the following discussion of risk factors identifies factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 



cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years they may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker the development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks that individually or in the aggregate have been material to verizons operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack our presence in the iot industry which includes offerings of telematics products and services could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and natural disasters including an increasing prevalence of wildfires and intensified storm activities such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events 

table of contents 

we are implementing and will continue to implement measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption damage to our reputation and reduced profits 

public health crises including the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic which had an adverse effect on our operating results in 2020 our business is based on our ability to provide products and services to customers throughout the united states and around the world and the ability of those customers to use and pay for those products and services for their businesses and in their daily lives as a result our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a crisis like the covid19 pandemic that significantly impacts the way customers use and are able to pay for our products and services the way our employees are able to provide services to our customers and the ways that our partners and suppliers are able to provide products and services to us for example public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 and initiatives verizon has taken in response to the health crisis to promote the health and safety of our employees and provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers along with the related global slowdown in economic activity resulted in decreased revenues increased costs and lower earnings per share during 2020 in addition such a crisis could significantly increase the probability or consequences of the risks our business faces in ordinary circumstances such as risks associated with our supplier and vendor relationships risks of an economic slowdown regulatory risks and the costs and availability of financing because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing the impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in 2021 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict in addition the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations depends on many factors including those discussed above that are not within our control 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as fiber switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend these suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including for example disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic if such failures occur we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 225 of our workforce is represented by the communications workers of america or the international brotherhood of electrical workers while we have labor contracts in place with these unions with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations in addition while a small percentage of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions for bargaining we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it could have on our operations 



we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industries the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telecommunications companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers and application and device providers while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings a projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and has caused us in the past and may cause us in the future to record goodwill impairment charges the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in 

table of contents 

which the charge is taken in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels our ability to market our products and services effectively and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market 

the deployment of our 5g network is subject to a variety of risks including those related to equipment and spectrum availability unexpected costs and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues these issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new offerings and technologies such as 5g technology we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services dropping down in price plans or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 



changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level such as those described below new laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change or requirements limiting our ability to discontinue service to customers could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our consumer business and verizon media businesses impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers 

• privacy and data protection  we are subject to federal state and international laws related to privacy and data protection europes general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act which went into effect in january 2020 both include significant penalties for noncompliance in addition other new privacy laws took effect in 2020 including in brazil and maine generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at all levels of 

table of contents 

government globally and privacyrelated legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses 

• regulation of broadband internet access services  in its 2015 title ii order the fcc nullified its longstanding light touch approach to regulating broadband internet access services and reclassified these services as telecommunications services subject to utilitiesstyle common carriage regulation the fcc repealed the 2015 title ii order in december 2017 and returned to its traditional lighttouch approach for these services the 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the dc circuit but may be revisited by future fcc commissions or by congress and further appeals and challenges are possible the outcome and timing of these or any other challenge remains uncertain several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services in some cases different from the fcc’s 2015 rules the enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain 

• open access  we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice moreover certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services 

the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims property claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 



verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2020 verizon had approximately 1185 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness 94 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and 106 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal interest and other amounts payable on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as working capital capital expenditures dividend payments and acquisitions 

• making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements debt refinancing acquisitions or other purposes 

• reducing verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions 

• making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business and 

• exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates 

adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our ability to obtain funding under assetbacked debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized our borrowing costs also can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 132200 employees and approximately 190000 retirees as of december 31 2020 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the patient protection and affordable care act increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments

impacts of the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic 

this disclosure discusses the actions verizon has taken in response to the covid19 pandemic and the impacts it has had on our business as well as related known or expected trends the disclosure in the remainder of this managements discussion  analysis of financial condition and results of operations is qualified by the disclosure in this section on the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and to the extent that the disclosure in the remainder of managements discussion  analysis refers to a financial or performance metric that has been affected by a trend or activity that reference is in addition to any impact discussed in this section on the impacts of the pandemic 

covid19 was identified in late 2019 and in 2020 spread throughout the world including throughout the united states us public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 have varied significantly across the us but at various times during the year ended december 31 2020 a significant percentage of the us population was subject to meaningful restrictions on activities which included limitations on the operation of businesses including retail operations requirements that individuals remain in or close to their homes school closures travel restrictions limitations on large gatherings and other policies to promote or enforce physical distancing

similar restrictions have been implemented in many other countries in which we operate as described below these restrictions and our responses to them have significantly impacted how our customers use our products and services how they interact with us and how our employees work and provide services to our customers in addition governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses including telecommunications companies can operate their businesses and interact with their customers the pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have also resulted in a slowdown of global economic activity which has significantly impacted our customers as a result prior trends in our business may not be applicable to our operations during the pendency of the pandemic 

the impact of covid19 in the future will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic and the related public policy actions additional initiatives we may undertake in response to employee market or regulatory needs or demands the length and severity of the global economic slowdown and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term 

operations 

in response to the pandemic beginning in the first quarter 2020 we began executing our business continuity plans and evolving our operations to protect the safety of our employees and customers and to continue to provide critical infrastructure and connectivity to our customers as they changed their ways of working and living some of the initiatives we took include 

• moving over 115000 of our 132200 employees to remote work arrangements 

• temporarily closing nearly 70 of our companyowned retail store locations and moving to appointmentonly access to our remaining store locations 

• limiting our customerfocused field operations based on the criticality of the services being provided or repaired 

• enhancing our safety protocols for employees working outside their homes 

• providing temporary additional compensation to employees in front line roles that cannot be done from home 

• adjusting other compensation and benefits programs to address circumstances created by the pandemic 

• taking the federal communication commissions fccs keep americans connected pledge through which we pledged to waive late fees for and not terminate service to any of our consumer or small business customers who informed us that they had been impacted financially by the covid19 pandemic through may 13 which we extended to june 30 2020 

• providing additional data allocations to permit wireless consumer and small business customers to remain connected during the first several months of the pandemic 

• temporarily waiving activation and upgrade fees through digital distribution channels 

• working with business customers to address payment needs during the crisis 

• maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment 

as some of the restrictions on physical movement and limitations on business and other activities described above eased to varying degrees in the second half of 2020 we resumed certain of our operations with the health and safety of our employees and customers as our utmost priority and modified some of our temporary policies these initiatives include 

• transitioning to facility access at limited capacity where feasible for those with remote work arrangements 

• optimizing our sales channels to drive more activity through online and telesales to serve customers 

• reopening temporarily closed companyowned retail store locations and introducing social distancing measures for employee and customer safety such as touchless retail appointment scheduling and curbside pickup options 

• continuous monitoring of stores as well as temporary closures and cleaning of stores that have an identified covid19 exposure 

• starting july 1 customers who had notified us that they had been financially impacted by the pandemic and had an unpaid balance were automatically enrolled in our stay connected repayment program which allows customers to pay off their service balance over six months and extends any unpaid device payment plan agreements by the number of months unpaid 

• resuming most customerfocused field operations 

• discontinuing certain of our temporary compensation and benefits arrangements 

we expect that we will continue to revise our approach to these initiatives as the circumstances surrounding the pandemic evolve in 2021 in order to meet the needs of our employees customers and the company and continue to provide our innovative products and services 

liquidity and capital resources 

verizon finished the fourth quarter 2020 in a strong financial position as of december 31 2020 our balance sheet included 



as of december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents balance wa s 222 billion compared to 26 billion as of december 31 2019 we made the decision at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic to maintain a higher cash balance in order to further protect the company against the economic uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic and to opportunistically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time when we believed that market conditions were favorable during the three months ended december 31 2020 we redeemed 566 million of unsecured notes maturing in 2021 as of december 31 2020 we have less than 150 million of unsecured notes maturing in 2021 as of december 31 2020 we had not drawn down on our 95 billion revolving credit facility and the unused borrowing capacity was approximately 94 billion the revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change during the three months ended december 31 2020 we issued 120 billion aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated unsecured notes and £12 billion aggregate principal 

ta b le of contents 

amount of pound sterling denominated unsecured notes in addition we completed exchange offers with respect to 17 series of unsecured notes issued by verizon allowing us to exchange the notes accepted in the exchange offers for new unsecured verizon notes having a later maturity date and for certain of the accepted series of notes cash we also amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date to 2024 we had no outstanding commercial paper as of december 31 2020 

the covid19 pandemic together with other dynamics in the marketplace has caused borrowing costs to fluctuate significantly and in certain cases restricted the ability of borrowers to access the capital markets and other sources of financing in order to provide financial flexibility and finance certain investments and projects we may continue to utilize external financing arrangements that have been or may be affected by these market conditions however we believe that our cash on hand the cash we expect to generate from our operations and cash from other sources of financing available to us are and will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating capital expenditure debt service and investing requirements 

we expect to continue to have sufficient cash to fund our operations although we could experience significant fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period during the pendency of the pandemic the net cash generated from our operations provides our primary source of cash flows while we have historically experienced consistently low levels of payment delinquencies among our consumer and business accounts beginning late in the first quarter 2020 we started to see increases in delinquencies across our retail customer base and our small and medium business accounts this change in delinquency rate moderated during the second quarter and improved to levels seen before the covid19 pandemic during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 accordingly our provision for credit losses increased in the first quarter 2020 but decreased in the second quarter of 2020 and remained flat in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 if these levels of delinquencies begin to grow again they could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows we could also experience fluctuations in our cash flows resulting from the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on macroeconomic conditions in the us and our customers working to become current on their bills in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond 

in addition we issue assetbacked debt secured by our device payment plan agreement receivables and the collections on such receivables these transactions require us to comply with various tests including delinquency and lossrelated tests which if not met would cause the assetbacked debt to amortize earlier and faster than otherwise expected the holders of our assetbacked debt do not have any recourse to verizon with respect to the payment of principal and interest on the debt however if an early amortization of our assetbacked debt occurs including as a result of increased customer delinquencies or losses relating to the covid19 pandemic all collections on the securitized device payment plan agreement receivables would be used to pay principal and interest on the assetbacked debt and our financing cash flow requirements would increase for the twelve months immediately following an early amortization event 

impacts on financial results 

our revenues and expenses in 2020 were impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of the actions we took to care for our employees and to keep our customers connected and as a result of our customers’ changing activities as well as the restrictions on activities and the global economic slowdown as describe d below the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our 2020 results was primarily a result of decreases in wireless service revenue wireless equipment revenue and advertising and search revenue at verizon media group verizon media and the operational actions we took as described above 

revenues 

the year ended december 31 2020 included lower overage revenues and lower fees from activations and upgrades and fewer fees as well as lower roaming revenues as our customers significantly reduced travel during the year as a result of our decision to keep our customers connected during the crisis we experienced fewer step ups in data plans in the first half of 2020 we saw the rate of step ups increase during the second half of 2020 during the first half of 2020 we also saw a reduction in advertising and search revenue in verizon media as customers scaled back their advertising campaigns this reduction moderated during the third quarter of 2020 and turned to revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 

we have seen considerably less churn in the consumer wireless base and lower equipment volumes and upgrade rates since the beginning of the pandemic as a result of changing customer behaviors we experienced significantly lower equipment revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 

expenses 

while certain expenses such as wireless equipment cost were lower during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the revenue impacts discussed above these decreases were partially offset by an increase in commission expense the increase in commission expense was a result of an expansion of our compensation programs for both employees and agents early in the pandemic this covid19 relief program did not qualify for deferral treatment as defined by accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers however the costs were not materially different on a cash basis 

as a result of waiving late fees and keeping customers connected during the pandemic pursuant to our pledge and pursuant to various state orders and laws we saw increases in delinquencies across our retail customer base and certain of our business accounts this change in the delinquency rate has since moderated as discussed above however if the levels of delinquencies for our consumer and small and medium business customers begin to grow again additional provisions to our allowance for credit losses may be required which could be significant we continue to monitor customer behavior and our expected loss assumptions and estimates

other 

equity and debt markets experienced significant volatility during 2020 partially as a result of the pandemic and federal governmental actions to stimulate the economy have significantly impacted interest rates these circumstances could affect the funding level of our pension plans and our calculated liabilities under our pension and other postemployment benefit plans other impacts from the pandemic on our financial results in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond could result from a further slowdown in the global economy additional regulatory or legislative initiatives that impact our relationships with our customers and other initiatives we undertake to respond to the needs of our employees and our customers 

business overview 

we have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units  verizon consumer group consumer and verizon business group business

capital expenditures and investments 

we continue to invest in our wireless networks highspeed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future during the year ended december 31 2020 these investments included 182 billion for capital expenditures see cash flows used in investing activities and operating environment and trends for additional information we believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy 

global network and technology 

we are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4g lte network while also building our next generation 5g network we are densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services on our 4g lte and 5g networks over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4g lte technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows as of december 31 2020 we have launched our 5g ultra wideband network in 61 us markets we have commercially launched 5g home in 12 of those markets we also launched our 5g nationwide network in october 2020 which is available in over 2700 cities across the us covering approximately 230 million people 5g nationwide uses low and midband spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing dss technology which allows 5g service to run simultaneously with 4g lte on multiple spectrum bands with dss whenever customers move outside verizon’s highband ultra wideband coverage area their 5genabled devices will remain on 5g technology using the lower spectrum bands where the 5g nationwide network is available this allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve both 4g and 5g customers 

to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copperbased products we continue to build fiberbased networks supporting data video and advanced business services  areas where demand for reliable highspeed connections is growing we are evolving the architecture of our networks to a nextgeneration multiuse platform providing improved efficiency and virtualization increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiberbased and radio access network technologies we call this the intelligent edge network we expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements speed the deployment of 5g wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost efficient manner

consolidated revenues 



consolidated revenues decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due to decreases in our consumer segment business segment and corporate and other 

revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading segment results of operations 

corporate and other revenues decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease of 417 million in revenues within verizon media 

consolidated operating expenses 



nm  not meaningful 

operating expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading segment results of operations 

cost of services 

cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service salaries and wages benefits materials and supplies content costs contracted services network access and transport costs customer provisioning costs computer systems support costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities and traffic acquisition costs aggregate customer service costs which include billing and service provisioning are allocated between cost of services and selling general and administrative expense 

cost of services decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to decreases in traffic acquisition costs due to the covid19 pandemic as well as decreases in costs related to the device protection offerings to our wireless retail postpaid customers roaming costs resulting from decreased travel due to the covid19 pandemic regulatory fees and personnel costs these decreases were partially offset by increases in customer premise equipment digital content other direct costs and rent expense as a result of adding capacity to the networks to support demand 

cost of wireless equipment 

cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of declines in the number of wireless devices sold as a result of an elongation of the handset upgrade cycle as well as lower gross adds and upgrade volumes partially due to the covid19 pandemic the decreases were partially offset by a shift to higher priced devices in the mix of wireless devices sold 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense includes salaries and wages and benefits not directly attributable to a service or product the provision for credit losses taxes other than income taxes advertising and sales commission costs call center and information technology costs regulatory fees professional service fees and rent and utilities for administrative space also included is a portion of the aggregate customer care costs as discussed above in cost of services 

selling general and administrative expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 12 billion loss resulting from the auction 103 spectrum license auction and a net gain from dispositions of assets and businesses during 2019 see special items as well as an increase in sales commission expense these increases were partially offset by decreases in personnel costs advertising expenses and the provision for credit losses the increase in sales commission expense during 2020 compared to 2019 was inclusive of a lower net deferral of

commission costs in the current year compared to the prior year as well as sales compensation while certain of our stores and agent locations were closed due to the covid19 pandemic 

depreciation and amortization expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the change in the mix of net depreciable assets 

media goodwill impairment 

the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019 for verizon media was a result of the companys annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter see critical accounting estimates 

other consolidated results 

other income expense net 

additional information relating to other income expense net is as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

other income expense net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations including interest income gains and losses from nonoperating asset dispositions debt extinguishment costs components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and foreign exchange gains and losses the change in other income expense net during 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by early debt redemption costs of 129 million recorded during 2020 compared to 36 billion recorded during 2019 see special items partially offset by pension and benefit charges of 16 billion recorded during 2020 compared to pension and benefit charges of 126 million recorded during 2019 see special items see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the other components of net periodic benefit cost income 

interest expense 



1 the average debt outstanding is a financial measure and is calculated by applying a simple average of prior thirteenmonth end balances of total shortterm and longterm debt net of discounts premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs 

2 the effective interest rate is the rate of actual interest incurred on debt it is calculated by dividing the total interest costs on debt balances by the average debt outstanding 

3 we believe that this measure is useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our debt financing cost and trends in our debt leverage management 

total interest expense decreased during 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates as a result of our refinancing activities 

provision for income taxes 



ta b le of contents 

the effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before the provision for income taxes the increase in the effective income tax rate and the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the recognition of a 22 billion tax benefit in connection with the disposition of preferred stock representing a minority interest in a foreign affiliate in 2019 that did not reoccur in 2020 see cash flows provided by operating activities for discussion of the receipt of the cash tax benefit in 2020 

a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

consolidated net income consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda 

consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization expenses consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda which are presented below are nongenerally accepted accounting principles gaap measures that we believe are useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability on a more variable cost basis as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to verizon’s competitors consolidated ebitda is calculated by adding back interest taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses to net income 

consolidated adjusted ebitda is calculated by excluding from consolidated ebitda the effect of the following nonoperational items equity in losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense net as well as the effect of special items we believe that this measure is useful to management investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance we believe that consolidated adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure taxes and depreciation and amortization policies further the exclusion of nonoperational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis see special items for additional information 

it is management’s intent to provide nongaap financial information to enhance the understanding of verizon’s gaap financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to but not instead of the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap each nongaap financial measure is presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the nongaap measure we believe that providing these nongaap measures in addition to the gaap measures allows management investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance the nongaap financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies 



1 includes early debt redemption costs where applicable see special items for additional information 

2 includes pension and benefits marktomarket adjustments and early debt redemption costs where applicable see special items for additional information 

3 includes impairment charges where applicable 

the changes in consolidated net income consolidated ebitda and consolidated adjusted ebitda in the table above during 2020 compared to 2019 were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses 



we have three segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units consumer business and media of which consumer and business are our reportable segments we measure and evaluate our segments based on segment operating income the use of segment operating income is consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance

for the year ended december 31 2020 fios service revenue totaled 104 billion and decreased 95 million or 09 compared to 2019 this decrease was due to decreases in fios video and voice revenues the decrease in fios video revenue reflects a onetime credit provided to customers related to regional sport networks during the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to overthetop offerings these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fios internet connections reflecting increased demand for higher broadband speeds as consumers work and learn from home during the covid19 pandemic

the telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to remain intense as traditional and nontraditional participants seek increased market share our highquality customer base and networks differentiate us from our competitors and give us the ability to plan and manage through changing economic and competitive conditions we remain focused on executing on the fundamentals of the business maintaining a highquality customer base delivering strong financial and operating results and strengthening our balance sheet we will continue to invest for growth which we believe is the key to creating value for our shareholders we continue to lead in 4g lte performance while building momentum for our 5g network our strategy lays the foundation for the future through investments in our intelligent edge network that enable efficiencies throughout our core infrastructure and deliver flexibility to meet customer requirements 

the us wireless market has achieved a high penetration of smartphones which reduces the opportunity for new phone connection growth for the industry we expect future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services and increasing the penetration of other connected devices including wearables tablets and iot devices we expect 5g technology will provide a significant opportunity for growth in the industry in 2021 and beyond with respect to our wireless connectivity products and services we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers including verizon and resell it to their customers resellers include cable companies and others we face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft corporation alphabet inc apple inc and others are offering alternative

means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

with respect to wireless services and equipment pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape we compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price as the demand for wireless services continues to grow wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices these service offerings will vary from time to time based on customer needs technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers 

we expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans driven in part by attractive bundled content with premium brands as well as from increased connections per account future service revenue growth opportunities will be dependent on expanding the penetration of our services increasing the number of ways that our customers can connect with our networks and services and the development of new ecosystems we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and some providers offer device leasing arrangements 

current and potential competitors in the wireline service market include cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our wireline services a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises and government customers many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

despite this challenging environment we expect that we will be able to grow key aspects of our wireline services we continue to provide network reliability and offer products which include fiberoptic internet access several video services and voice services further we will continue to offer our business and government customers more robust ip products and services and advance our iot strategies by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity platform and solution layers 

the online advertising market continues to evolve as online users are migrating from traditional desktop to mobile and multipledevice usage also there is a continued shift towards programmatic advertising which presents opportunities to connect online advertisers with the appropriate online users in a rapid environment our media business competes with other online search engines advertising platforms digital video services and social networks we are experiencing pressure from search and desktop usage and believe the pressure in these sectors will continue we are implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and build services around our core content pillars to diversify revenue and return to growth 

we will also continue to focus on cost efficiencies to ensure we have the maximum flexibility to adjust to changes in the competitive and economic environments and maximize returns to shareholders 

2021 connection trends 

in our consumer segment we expect to continue to attract new customers and maintain highquality retail postpaid customers capitalizing on demand for data services and providing our customers new ways of using wireless services in their daily lives we expect that future connection growth will be driven by smartphones tablets and other connected devices such as wearables we believe the combination of our wireless network performance and mix  match unlimited plans provides a superior customer experience supporting increased penetration of data services and the continued attraction and retention of higher valued retail postpaid connections we expect to manage churn by providing a consistent reliable experience on our wireless service and focusing on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and continued focus in our distribution channels we expect to continue to grow our fios internet connections as we seek to increase our penetration rates within our fios service areas further supported by the demand for higher speed internet connections in fios video the business continues to face ongoing pressure as observed throughout the linear television market we expect to manage market pressure by offering customers a choice of video service including options such as mix  match on fios and other offerings we have experienced continuing access line and dsl losses as customers have disconnected both primary and secondary lines and switched to alternative technologies such as wireless voice over internet protocol and cable for voice and data services 

in our business segment we offer wireless products and services to business and government customers across the us we continue to grow our retail connections while operating in a competitive environment we expect to maintain connection growth in part by adding capacity and density to our 4g lte network in addition to leading the buildout of our 5g network we expect this connection growth combined with our industryleading network assets will provide additional opportunities to sell solutions such as those around security advanced communications and professional services we expect to expand our existing services offered to business customers through our intelligent edge network our multiuse platform

2021 operating revenue trends 

in our consumer segment we expect to see an acceleration of service revenue growth in 2021 as customers shift to higher access plans with additional services and increase the number of devices they connect with our networks and services we expect fios revenue to benefit in 2021 as growth in our broadband customer base offsets the impact of the shift from the tripleplay bundle to standalone service 

in our business segment we expect wireless revenue to expand driven by an increase in the number of connections we expect that our fios products through increased penetration will also contribute to revenue growth legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures in addition certain products and services provided by our public sector and global enterprise groups experienced elevated demand during 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic demand for those products and services may return to more historical levels in 2021 

our media business verizon media is primarily made up of digital advertising products we expect verizon media revenue to grow in 2021 as the strong advertising trends from 2020 are expected to continue with the exception of political advertising spend we will continue the implementation of initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets and build services around our core content pillars we expect positive growth in mobile services and products 

2021 operating expense and cash flow from operations trends 

we expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated ebitda margin to remain strong as we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2021 and beyond business excellence initiatives include the adoption of the zerobased budgeting methodology driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks evolving our information technology strategy and the continuing benefit from the voluntary separation program we believe our additional investments in our business segment in both product simplification and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5g and one fiber the goal of the business excellence initiative is to take 10 billion of cumulative cash outflows out of the business over four years beginning in 2018 as part of this initiative we are focusing on both operating expenses and capital expenditures our business excellence initiatives produced cumulative cash savings of 95 billion through the end of 2020 from a mix of capital and operational expenditure activities the program remains on track to achieve our goal in 2021 we will continue to explore opportunities for additional savings beyond the program 

we create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services in addition we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders verizon’s board of directors increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 20 during 2020 making this the fourteenth consecutive year in which we have raised our dividend 

our goal is to use our cash to create longterm value for our shareholders we will continue to look for investment opportunities that will help us to grow the business strengthen our balance sheet acquire spectrum licenses see cash flows from investing activities pay dividends to our shareholders and when appropriate buy back shares of our outstanding common stock see cash flows from financing activities 

capital expenditures 

our 2021 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services including expanding our core networks adding capacity and density to our 4g lte network in order to stay ahead of our customers’ increasing data demands and deploying our 5g network transforming our structure to deploy the intelligent edge network while reducing the cost to deliver services to our customers and pursuing other opportunities to drive operating efficiencies we expect that the new network architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements improve our 4g lte coverage speed the deployment of 5g technology and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market the level and the timing of the company’s capital expenditures within these broad categories can vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors outside of our control such as material weather events equipment availability from vendors and permits from local governments we believe that we have significant discretion over the amount and timing of our capital expenditures on a companywide basis as we are not subject to any agreement that would require significant capital expenditures on a designated schedule or upon the occurrence of designated events 





we use the net cash generated from our operations to fund expansion and modernization of our networks service and repay external financing pay dividends invest in new businesses and spectrum and when appropriate buy back shares of our outstanding common stock our sources of funds primarily from operations and to the extent necessary from external financing arrangements are sufficient to meet

ongoing operating and investing requirements we made the decision at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic to maintain a higher cash balance in order to further protect the company against the economic uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic and to opportunistically raise cash to finance future obligations at a time when we believed that market conditions were favorable we expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities including for example to complete our acquisition of tracfone wireless inc tracfone or to acquire additional wireless spectrum or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity see market risk for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies

cash flows provided by operating activities 

our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations net cash provided by operating activities increased by 60 billion during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to improvements in working capital which includes the receipt of the 22 billion cash tax benefit related to preferred shares in a foreign affiliate sold during the fourth quarter 2019 and lower wireless volumes as well as the receipt of 764 million relating to the settlement of interest rate swaps during 2020 in addition an employee benefits contribution as well as severance payments as a result of the voluntary separation program in 2019 did not repeat in 2020 these comparative increases were partially offset by lower earnings in 2020 we made a 300 million discretionary employee benefits contribution during the first quarter 2019 to our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the 2019 discretionary pension contribution and higher actual asset returns than expected returns in both 2019 and 2020 we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2030 subject to changes in market conditions the 2019 contribution also improved the funded status of our qualified pension plan

interest rate and fees 

the loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of verizon i the base rate defined as the greater of the rate last quoted by the wall street journal as the prime rate the federal funds rate plus 0500 and the onemonth london interbank offered rate libor plus 1000 subject to a floor of 1000 or ii libor in each case plus a margin to be determined by reference to verizon’s credit ratings and ranging from 0000 to 0125 in the case of base rate loans and 0625 to 1125 in the case of libor loans additional margin of 0125 is added to the loan on december 31 2021 

verizon will pay a commitment fee on the daily actual unused commitment of each lender starting on the date that is 60 days after the effective date through the last day of the availability period this fee accrues at a rate determined by reference to verizon’s credit ratings and ranges from 0070 to 0125 per annum

covenants and events of default 

the credit agreement contains certain negative covenants including a negative pledge covenant a merger or similar transaction covenant and an accounting changes covenant and affirmative covenants and events of default that are customary for companies maintaining an investment grade credit rating an event of default may result in the inability to borrow in certain circumstances or the acceleration of any outstanding loan under the credit agreement as applicable 

common stock 

common stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we issued 23 million and 38 million common shares from treasury stock respectively which had an insignificant aggregate value 

in february 2020 the verizon board of directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of verizons common stock the program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized whichever is sooner the program permits verizon to repurchase shares over time with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs there were no repurchases of common stock during 2020 and 2019 under our current or previously authorized share buyback program 

credit ratings 

verizon’s credit ratings did not change in 2020 or 2019 

securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold securities a securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

covenants 

our credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large investment grade companies these covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion pay taxes maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies preserve our corporate existence keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions maintain our properties provide financial and other reports to our lenders limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations and other similar covenants

change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 totaled 222 billion a 196 billion increase compared to december 31 2019 primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 

restricted cash at december 31 2020 totaled 13 billion relatively flat compared to restricted cash at december 31 2019 primarily related to cash collections on the device payment plan agreement receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe when viewed with our gaap results provides management investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures including capitalized software from net cash provided by operating activities we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets are necessary for ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



the increase in free cash flow during 2020 is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows partially offset by the increase in capital expenditures discussed above 

employee benefit plans funded status and contributions 

employer contributions 

we operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans these plans primarily relate to our domestic business units we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in 2020 in 2019 we made contributions of 300 million to our qualified pension plans during 2020 and 2019 we made contributions of 57 million and 71 million to our nonqualified pension plans respectively 

the company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return in an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities we have adopted a liability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate sensitivity of the liability we expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase referred to as liability hedging with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries however we also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns nonqualified pension contributions are estimated to be approximately 70 million in 2021 

contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans generally relate to payments for benefits on an asincurred basis since these other postretirement benefit plans do not have funding requirements similar to the pension plans we contributed 709 million and 449 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2020 and 2019 respectively contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans are estimated to be approximately 800 million in 2021

critical accounting estimates 

a summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements is as follows 

wireless licenses and goodwill 

wireless licenses and goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinitelived intangible assets and therefore are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period providing impairment indicators are present we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature may change over time and can vary from actual results it is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions including the timing and amount of future cash flows margins growth rates market participant assumptions comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates which could result in different fair value estimates significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the abovenoted estimates and assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units 

wireless licenses 

the carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately 961 billion as of december 31 2020 we aggregate our wireless licenses into one single unit of accounting as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network our wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses 

in the first quarter of 2020 we reclassified substantially all of our 39 ghz wireless licenses including capitalized interest with a carrying value of 28 billion to assets held for sale in connection with the fccs incentive auction auction 103 as a result these wireless licenses were adjusted down to their fair value of 16 billion resulting in a pretax loss of 12 billion 914 million aftertax 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount as part of our assessment we considered several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business macroeconomic conditions including changes in interest rates and discount rates industry and market considerations including industry revenue and ebitda margin results projections and recent merger and acquisition activity the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a whole as well as other factors our annual impairment tests in 2020 and 2019 indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses remained above their carrying value and therefore did not result in an impairment 

goodwill 

to determine if goodwill is potentially impaired we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we elect not to conduct the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist the determination of whether an impairment has occurred requires the determination of the fair value of each the reporting unit being assessed 

under the qualitative assessment we consider several qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit from the last quantitative test and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test macroeconomic conditions including changes in interest rates and discount rates industry and market considerations including industry revenue and ebitda margin results projections and recent merger and acquisition activity the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit as well as other factors 

under our quantitative assessment the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach and a discounted cash flow method as a form of the income approach the market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results the discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two componentsprojected cash flows and a terminal value the terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value the discount rate represented our estimate of the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc or expected return that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date the application of our goodwill impairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model the discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on discount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives as well as revenue and ebitda growth relative to history and market trends and expectations the market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in the selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks the selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and profitability and volatility in market prices of peer companies these valuation inputs are inherently uncertain and an adverse change in one or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future 

a projected sustained decline in a reporting units revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may result in impairment charges such a decline could be driven by among other things 1 further anticipated decreases in service pricing sales volumes and longterm growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors or 2 the inability to achieve or delays in achieving 

ta b le of contents 

the goals in strategic initiatives also adverse changes to macroeconomic factors such as increases to longterm interest rates would also negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit 

at december 31 2020 the balance of our goodwill was approximately 248 billion of which 172 billion was in our consumer reporting unit and 75 billion was in our business reporting unit we performed qualitative impairment assessments for our consumer and business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2020 our qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values for our consumer and business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment 

in november 2018 we announced a strategic reorganization of our business which resulted in changes to our segments and reporting units effective april 1 2019 as a result we performed impairment assessments of the reporting units impacted by the strategic reorganization specifically our historical wireless historical wireline and historical connect reporting units on march 31 2019 immediately before our strategic reorganization became effective our impairment assessments indicated that the fair value for each of our historical wireless historical wireline and historical connect reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in a goodwill impairment we then performed quantitative assessments of our consumer and business reporting units on april 1 2019 immediately following our strategic reorganization our impairment assessments indicated that the fair value for each of our consumer and business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in a goodwill impairment our media reporting unit was not impacted by the strategic reorganization and there was no indicator of impairment as of the reorganization date 

we performed qualitative impairment assessments for our consumer and business reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2019 our qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our consumer and business reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment 

we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our media reporting unit in 2019 in connection with verizon’s annual budget process during the fourth quarter of 2019 the leadership at both verizon media and verizon completed a comprehensive fiveyear strategic planning review of verizon medias business prospects resulting in unfavorable adjustments to verizon medias financial projections these revised projections were used as a key input into verizon medias annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 consistent with our accounting policy we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs including our revised projections discount rate and expected growth rates which resulted in the determination that the fair value of the media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately 186 million 176 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2019 in our consolidated statement of income the goodwill balance of the media reporting unit had been fully written off as a result of the impairment charge 

at december 31 2019 the balance of our goodwill was approximately 244 billion of which 171 billion was in our consumer reporting unit and 73 billion was in our business reporting unit 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

we maintain benefit plans for most of our employees including for certain employees pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2020 in the aggregate pension plan benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets which will result in future pension plan expense other postretirement benefit plans have larger benefit obligations than plan assets resulting in expense significant benefit plan assumptions including the discount rate used the longterm rate of return on plan assets the determination of the substantive plan and health care trend rates are periodically updated and impact the amount of benefit plan income expense assets and obligations changes to one or more of these assumptions could significantly impact our accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in these assumptions on the benefit obligations and expense income recorded as well as on the funded status due to an increase or a decrease in the actual versus expected return on plan assets as of december 31 2020 and for the year then ended pertaining to verizon’s pension and postretirement benefit plans is provided in the table below 



 in determining its pension and other postretirement obligation the company used a weightedaverage discount rate of 26 the rate was selected to approximate the composite interest rates available on a selection of highquality bonds available in the market at december 31 2020 the bonds selected had maturities that coincided with the time periods during which benefit payments are expected to occur were noncallable and available in sufficient quantities to ensure marketability at least 300 million par outstanding 

the annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is december 31 we use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits the full yield curve approach 

ta b le of contents 

refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date these individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost 

income taxes 

our current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards changes in tax laws and rates acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and nonrecurring items as a global commercial enterprise our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments we account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes which requires the use of a twostep approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts circumstances and information available at each reporting date to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments we recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

property plant and equipment 

our property plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets we record property plant and equipment at cost we depreciate property plant and equipment on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the assets we expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2020 depreciation expense of 27 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately 45 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense 

accounts receivable 

prior to january 1 2020 accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts the gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for doubtful accounts were presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets we maintained allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable including our directchannel device payment plan agreement receivables for estimated losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments indirectchannel device payment receivables are considered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest and credit losses were recorded as incurred however receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered impaired subsequent to january 1 2020 accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered the gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets we maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments we recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management’s expectation of the asset’s collectability the allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts the credit quality of the customer base the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions such as the covid19 pandemic as well as management’s expectations of conditions in the future if applicable our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics 

we record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible for device payment plan agreement receivables we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model the expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above the loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the weightedaverage loss rate used for determining the allowance balance 

we monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool wireline service receivables are disaggregated and pooled by the following customer groups consumer small and medium business global enterprise public sector and wholesale for wireless service receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month rolling average writeoff balance multiplied by the average lifecycle of an account from billing to writeoff the risk of loss is assessed over the contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s qualitative considerations for global enterprise public sector and wholesale wireline receivables the allowance for credit losses is based on historical writeoff experience and individual customer credit risk if applicable we consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as discussed above 

if there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business including the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations changes in investment equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates we employ risk management strategies which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps forward starting interest rate swaps interest rate swaps interest rate caps treasury rate locks and foreign exchange forwards we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 

it is our general policy to enter into interest rate foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in optimizing exposure to various market risks our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions we do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings 

counterparties to our derivative contracts are major financial institutions with whom we have negotiated derivatives agreements isda master agreements and credit support annex csa agreements which provide rules for collateral exchange the csa agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value at december 31 2020 we held 02 billion of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange agreements which were recorded as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019 we held an insignificant amount of collateral related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements which were recorded as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet while we may be exposed to credit losses due to the nonperformance of our counterparties we consider the risk remote and do not expect that any such nonperformance would result in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition due to our diversified pool of counterparties see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the derivative portfolio

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on our shortterm debt and the portion of longterm debt that carries floating interest rates as of december 31 2020 approximately 83 of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate indebtedness including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges of approximately 227 million the interest rates on our existing longterm debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings 

certain of our floating rate debt and our interest rate derivative transactions utilize interest rates that are linked to libor as the benchmark rate libor is the subject of recent us and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to become unavailable or to perform or be reported differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our floating rate debt or exposure under our interest rate derivative transactions we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt taking into account the impact of our interest rate hedging 

the table that follows summarizes the fair values of our longterm debt including current maturities and interest rate swap derivatives as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100basispoint upward and downward shifts in the yield curve our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans if any because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates

interest rate caps 

we also have interest rate caps which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting we enter into interest rate caps to mitigate our interest exposure to interest rate increases on our abs financing facilities and abs notes the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant at both december 31 2020 and 2019 at december 31 2020 there was no outstanding total notional amount for these contracts and at december 31 2019 the total notional amount of these contracts was 679 million

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in internal control–integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in 2013 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2020 

in the ordinary course of business we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment in the third quarter of 2020 we began a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning erp system which will replace many of our existing core financial systems the new erp system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting the implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years 

as the phased implementation of the new erp system continues we could have changes to our processes and procedures which in turn could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as such changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of verizon’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

distribution 

we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to consumer customers 

our direct channel including our companyoperated stores is a core component of our distribution strategy our sales and service centers also represent a significant distribution channel for our services 

our indirectdigital partners channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the us as well as through the internet the majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also have relationships with highprofile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services as well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services in 2019 we grew our digital channel and expanded omni channel experiences for our customers to offer choice and convenience 

in addition to our direct channel our business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by resellers nonstocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers 

competition and related trends 

the telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to remain intense as traditional and nontraditional participants seek increased market share 

with respect to our wireless connectivity products and services we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers including verizon and resell it to their customers resellers may include cable companies competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market increased network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies such as 5g the introduction of new products and services offerings that include additional premium content new market entrants the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum and regulatory changes in 2019 we began offering apple music and disney to customers as part of their unlimited plans competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers and as mvnos resell wireless communication services 

we also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft corporation alphabet inc apple inc and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

with respect to our wireline connectivity services we compete against cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop ott providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services we introduced offerings that provide customized internet and video packages several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services we expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to ott offerings we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry 

 

 

 

customer service is highly valued by our business customers we provide global enterprise and public sector and other customers with ready access to their system and performance information and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers we service our small and medium business customers through service representatives and online support as well as through storebased representatives for small business customers for wholesale customers we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives 



 

in addition to these competitive factors and trends companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our business segment a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

in the global enterprise and public sector and other markets competition remains high primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence we compete in this area with system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers in addition some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software defined network communication applications and other computing tasks via networks rather than by the use of inhouse machines 

in the small and medium business market customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumerlike look and feel are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full lifecycle offers that simplify the process of starting running and growing their businesses several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

our wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity 

verizon media 

our media business verizon media includes diverse media and technology brands that serve both consumers and businesses verizon media provides consumers with owned and operated and thirdparty search properties as well as mail news finance sports and entertainment offerings and provides other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising content delivery and video streaming platforms in 2019  verizon medias revenues were 75 billion  

verizon media products and solutions 

ad platform 

our verizon media ad platform provides advertisers and publishers with a simplified suite of intelligent advertising solutions across desktop mobile and television devices verizon medias business is comprised primarily of search advertising display advertising ecommerce and subscriptions 

 

 

 

 

verizon media platform

global network and technology 

our global network architecture is used by both consumer and business our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies 

network evolution 

we are evolving the architecture of our networks to a nextgeneration multiuse platform providing improved efficiency and virtualization increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiberbased and radio access network technologies we call this the intelligent edge network we expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements improve our fourthgeneration  4g  longterm evolution  lte  wireless coverage speed the deployment of 5g wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market 

5g deployment 

over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services we believe 5g technology will be able to provide users with eight capabilities or currencies the eight currencies are peak data rates mobile data volumes mobility number of connected devices energy efficiency of connected devices service deployment reduced latency and improved reliability we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4g lte technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows during 2018 we commercially launched 5g home on proprietary standards in four us markets and on global standards in a fifth us market in 2019 we also launched our 5g ultra wideband network in 31 us markets in 2019 as well as several 5gcompatible smartphones 

4g lte 

our primary wireless network technology platform is 4g lte which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technology as of december 31 2019  our 4g lte network is available in over 700 markets covering approximately 327 million people including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners under this program we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4g lte equipment and 700 megahertz mhz c block and advanced wireless services aws spectrum 

wireless network reliability and buildout 

we consider the reliability coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services as we design and deploy our network we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network increasing the density of our network elements deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service we choose among these strategies based on the circumstances present at different times in each of our service areas 

we have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services on our 4g lte and 5g networks we are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience we continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates 

in order to build and upgrade our existing 4g lte network and deploy our 5g network we must complete a variety of steps which can include securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for our macro and small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations we utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites 

our networks include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the us where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the us 

fios 

residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years and we believe that demand will continue to grow we expect the continued emergence of new video services new data applications and the proliferation of ip devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput we believe that the passive optical network pon technology underpinning fios positions us well to meet these demands in a costeffective and efficient manner 

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network our pon infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the business segment especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services 

global ip 

verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiberoptic networks in the world providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries our global ip network includes longhaul metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations 

global business is rapidly evolving to an everythingasaservice model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services we are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice video and data communications services we are licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the us this spectrum is collectively called low and midband spectrum we are using our low and midband spectrum to provide both 3g and 4g lte wireless services however we are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3g service to provide 4g lte service we are also repurposing low and midband spectrum to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 gigahertz ghz band collectively called millimeter wave spectrum 

millimeter wave spectrum is being used for our 5g technology deployment we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed as well as the wider deployment of 5g mobile and fixed services we can meet our future 4g and 5g spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur 

from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future in certain cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases require us to obtain governmental approvals 

information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2019 verizon annual report to shareholders in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

strategic transactions 

during march 2015 we completed a transaction with american tower corporation american tower pursuant to which american tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11300 of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of 50 billion we have subleased capacity on the towers from american tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates with options to renew under the terms of the lease agreements american tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years as the leases expire american tower has fixedprice purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms as part of this transaction we also sold 162 towers for 71 million

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad we also actively grant licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration for verizon we do not believe that the loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

we periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services 

acquisitions and divestitures 

information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2019 verizon annual report to shareholders under the heading management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  acquisitions and divestitures and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

regulatory and competitive trends 

regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional competitors many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to a highly competitive market that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

federal state and local regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services traditionally the fcc recognized broadband internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations in 2015 the fcc declared that broadband internet access services are telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act in december 2017 the fcc adopted an order reversing the 2015 title ii order to return to light touch regulation of broadband internet access services the light touch portions of this order have been upheld by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit but further appeals are likely the part of the fcc order automatically preempting state action on the subject was vacated and a number of states are likely to join those that have taken steps to regulate broadband regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to federal state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including wireline wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the media and iot space at the federal level our voice business is subject to the fccs privacy requirements oversight of broadband internet access privacy and data security is governed by the federal trade commission ftc generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level and several privacyrelated bills have been introduced or are under considerations at each level europes general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 includes significant penalties for noncompliance in addition a new privacy law took effect in california at the beginning of 2020 an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in maine in 2020 and other states are considering additional regulations these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers the fcc is also addressing the use by american companies of equipment produced by companies imposing potential national security risks but verizon does not use such equipment in its network in addition due to recent natural disasters federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

operational risks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years they may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker the development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks that individually or in the aggregate have been material to verizons operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack our presence in the iot industry which includes offerings of telematics products and services could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and natural disasters including an increasing prevalence of wildfires and intensified storm activities such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events we are implementing and will continue to implement measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption damage to our reputation and reduced profits 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as fiber switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend these suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including for example disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the coronavirus if such failures occur we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our 

business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 23 of our workforce was represented by labor unions while we have labor contracts in place with these unions with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations in addition while a small percentage of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations 

economic and strategic risks 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industries the rapid development of new technologies services and products have eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers and application and device providers while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings a projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and has caused us in the past and may cause us in the future to record goodwill impairment charges the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market 

the deployment of our 5g network is subject to a variety of risks including those related to equipment availability unexpected costs and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues these issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new offerings and technologies such as 5g technology we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services dropping down in price plans or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

regulatory and legal risks 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level such as those described below or new laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media business impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers 

 

 

 

the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims property claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 

financial risks 

verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2019  verizon had approximately 991 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness 94 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility and 124 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 

 



 

adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our ability to obtain funding under assetbacked debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized our borrowing costs also can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 135000 employees and approximately 191000 retirees as of december 31 2019 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the patient protection and affordable care act increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments

wireless equipment 

we offer several categories of wireless equipment including a variety of smartphone and other handsets wirelessenabled internet devices such as tablets laptop computers and netbooks and other wireless enabled connected devices such as smart watches and other wearables and our hum product 

distribution 

we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers for resale including resellers that buy from us competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market increased network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services offerings that include additional premium content new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers and as mobile virtual network operators resell wireless communication services 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft corporation google inc apple inc and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry these include the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the services of wireless and cable competitors 

strategic transaction

wireline 

background 

our wireline segment provides communications products and enhanced services including video and data services corporate networking solutions security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services we provide these products and services to consumers in the us as well as to carriers businesses and government customers both in the us and around the world  in 2018  wireline revenues were 298 billion  representing approximately 23  of verizon’s aggregate revenues 

to compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copperbased products such as voice services we continue to build our wireline business around a fiberbased network supporting data video and advanced business services  areas where demand for reliable highspeed connections is growing we continue to seek ways to increase revenue further realize operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability across the segment we are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline businesses we expect our multiuse fiber intelligent edge network initiative will create opportunities to generate revenue from fiberbased services in our wireline business   

wireline service and product offerings 

we organize our service and product offerings by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings  consumer markets enterprise solutions partner solutions and business markets 

consumer markets 

consumer markets provides residential fixed connectivity solutions including internet tv and voice services we provide these services over our 100 fiberoptic network under the brand fios and over a traditional copperbased network to customers who are not served by fios in 2018  consumer markets revenues were 126 billion  representing approximately 42  of wireline’s aggregate revenues

partner solutions 

partner solutions provides communications services including data voice local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local long distance and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers in 2018  partner solutions revenues were 47 billion  representing approximately 16  of wireline’s aggregate revenues a portion of partner solutions revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies most of which compete directly with us 

partner solutions provides the following key services to both wireless and wireline carriers 

data services we offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their endusers and subscribers our data services include highspeed digital data offerings such as ethernet and wavelength services as well as core timedivision multiplexing tdm data circuits such as ds1s and ds3s in addition we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks we have also launched a dark fiber product for wireless carriers as demand for wireless data continues to grow and dark fiber plays a larger role in their network architecture

in addition to the traditional voice and networking products and fios services noted in the consumer markets section above business markets also offers traditional circuitbased network products and services advanced networking solutions advanced communications services and security services as noted in the enterprise solutions section above 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional and nontraditional participants seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers overthetop providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions   

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth   

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

 

 

 

 

in the consumer markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include fios internet tv and voice services and we have introduced market offers targeted to our verizon wireless customers several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a tv computer tablet or mobile phone we expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to overthetop offerings 

we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

in the enterprise solutions market competition remains high primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence we compete in this area with system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers in addition some of the largest it services companies are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets or forging new alliances to improve cost structure and focus on solutions which are growth catalysts for technology spending many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than by the use of inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

our partner solutions business competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

in business markets customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve solution speed and simplicity with a consumerlike look and feel are becoming key differentiators for both our smb and sled customers smb customers are seeking full lifecycle offers that simplify the process of starting running and growing their businesses while sled customers want similar services that are high quality and secure and that enable material improvement in citizen outreach public safety and city infrastructure performance 

strategic transactions 

in april 2016 we completed the sale access line sale of our local exchange business and related landline activities in california florida and texas including fios internet and video customers switched and special access lines and highspeed internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to frontier communications corporation frontier for approximately 105 billion approximately 73 billion net of income taxes subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of 06 billion of indebtedness from verizon by frontier the transaction which included the acquisition by frontier of the equity interests of verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs in california florida and texas did not involve any assets or liabilities of verizon wireless

additional information regarding these strategic transactions is included in the 2018  verizon annual report to shareholders in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

network and technology 

wireless 

our primary network technology platform is 4g lte which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technologies in addition over the past several years we have been leading the development of 5g wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5g wireless services   

our 4g lte network is available in approximately 500 markets covering approximately 331 million people including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners under this program we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4g lte equipment and 700 megahertz mhz c block and advanced wireless services aws spectrum we currently have 21 lte in rural america partners that provide 4g lte coverage to an area covering approximately three million people 

we use hd calling enabled by volte in addition to 3g code division multiple access cdma technology to provide voice calling services to our customers 

we consider the reliability coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth 

we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions including video permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we have been densifying our 4g lte network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for  iot products and services but also positions us for the deployment of 5g technology  we are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience we have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the us where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the us certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice video and data communications services we are licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the us this spectrum is collectively called low and midband spectrum 

in addition to our low and midband spectrum we have spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 gigahertz ghz band collectively called millimeterwave spectrum in 2017 we entered into transactions to acquire nextlink and straight path each of which held millimeterwave spectrum licenses the nextlink acquisition closed in january 2018 and the straight path acquisition closed in february 2018 the spectrum acquired as part of these transactions is being used for our 5g technology deployment 

in january 2015 the fcc completed an auction of 65 mhz of spectrum in the aws3 band we participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses for which we paid cash of approximately 104 billion the fcc granted us these spectrum licenses in april 2015 

we are aggressively refarming 3g bands on 800 mhz and pcs bands for 4g lte use we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed as well as the wider deployment of 5g mobile and fixed services we can meet our future 4g and 5g spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur on november 14 2018 the fcc started two sequential millimeter wave auctions verizon is an applicant in the fccs auction 101 and auction 102 relating to millimeter wave spectrum on january 24 2019 the fcc announced that auction 101 had concluded with a total of approximately 7026 million in bids received for the licenses that were won the fcc has stated that it will not and it will not permit any applicant to disclose the winning bidders of any of the licenses in auction 101 until auction 102 concludes in addition the fcc has indicated that a third millimeter wave auction will begin in the second half of 2019 and the auction for priority access licenses in the citizens’ broadband radio service cbrs 35 ghz band may also begin in 2019 in addition to spectrum we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies 

from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future in certain cases we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases require us to obtain governmental approvals 

additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2018 verizon annual report to shareholders in note 3  to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

5g deployment 

we believe 5g technology can provide users with eight capabilities or currencies the eight currencies are peak data rates mobile data volumes mobility connected devices energy efficiency service deployment latency and reliability  in late 2015 we launched the verizon 5g technology forum with key industry partners to develop 5g requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5g technologies we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4g lte technology lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows   during 2018 we commercially launched 5g home our alternative to wired home broadband on proprietary standards in four us markets sacramento los angeles houston and indianapolis we are the first 

company to bring 5g broadband internet service to consumers and we expect to expand coverage as we transition to global standards equipment in 2019 in addition we expect to launch mobile 5g services in 2019 as compatible devices become available 

network equipment and buildout 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing 4g lte network and deploy our 5g network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells as we densify our network we follow a similar process for small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations we utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites

residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years and we believe that demand will continue to grow the continued emergence of new video services new data applications and the proliferation of ip devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput we believe that the passive optical network pon technology underpinning fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a costeffective and efficient manner our pon technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiberoptic infrastructure 

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network our pon infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services

regulatory and competitive trends 

regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional companies many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

federal regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services traditionally the fcc recognized broadband internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations in 2015 the fcc declared that broadband internet access services are telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act in december 2017 the fcc adopted an order reversing the 2015 title ii order to return to light touch regulation of broadband internet access services this order is currently being challenged in the courts regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when where and how they want and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to federal state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including wireline wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the media and iot space at the federal level our voice business is subject to the fccs privacy requirements oversight of broadband internet access privacy and data security which had shifted from the federal trade commission ftc to the fcc following the fccs adoption of its 2015 title ii order returned to the ftc as a result of the fccs repeal of the 2015 title ii order generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level and several privacyrelated bills have been introduced or are under considerations at each level in addition a new data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for noncompliance and a new privacy law is scheduled to take effect in california in 2020 these laws could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments in april 2017 the fcc issued an order which is currently under appeal that revised the regulatory structure for business data services eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets the fcc determined to be competitive the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate 

state regulation and local regulation 

wireless services 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

wireline services 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated in addition as a video services operator in many states verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

environmental matters 

reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities these reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville ny which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the site into its formerly utilized sites remedial action program as a result the ace has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site an adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

operational risks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years further the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks which individually or in the aggregate have been material to verizons operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack moreover our increasing presence in the iot industry with offerings of telematics products and services including vehicle telematics could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and could further result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as fiber switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our 

business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 23  of our workforce was represented by labor unions while we have labor contracts in place with these unions with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations in addition while less than 1 of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations 

economic and strategic risks 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industries the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings if we are unable to compete effectively we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings a projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and cause us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future for example in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a 46 billion 45 billion aftertax goodwill impairment charge on our media reporting unit the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new offerings and technologies such as 5g technology we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services dropping down in price plans or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level such as those described below could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media and telematics businesses impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers 

 

 

 

the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims property claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 

financial risks 

verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2018  verizon had approximately 1030 billion  of outstanding unsecured indebtedness as well as approximately 94 billion  of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 144500  employees and approximately 195000 retirees as of december 31 2018  eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the patient protection and affordable care act increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments

customers on our fixedterm service plans historically paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices as of january 2017 we no longer offer consumers new fixedterm service plans for phones however we continue to offer subsidized plans to our business customers and we also continue to service existing fixedterm plans as consumers move to unsubsidized pricing driven by the activation of devices purchased under the verizon device payment program under this program eligible customers can purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement customers that activate service on such devices pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixedterm service plans

network 

we have the largest 4g lte network of any service provider in the us with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of december 31 2017 our 4g lte network covered approximately 319 million people in the us including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners we currently have 22 lte in rural america partners that provide 4g lte coverage to an area covering approximately three million people 

we consider the reliability of our wireless network as a key factor for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth 

we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions including video permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and also maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we have been densifying our 4g lte network by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antenna systems network densification not only enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for iot products and services but also positions us for the future deployment of 5g technology we are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience we have and will continue to deploy advanced technologies such as higher orders of modulation 4x4 multiple input multiple output licensed assistance access and increased cell site density primarily through small cell deployment just over 50 of our available low and midband spectrum portfolio is being used for 4g lte 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the us where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the us certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated atwill by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platform is 4g lte which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technologies 

we use hd calling enabled by volte in addition to 3g code division multiple access cdma technology to provide voice calling services to our customers 

we are committed to developing and deploying 5g wireless technology we launched the verizon 5g technology forum with key industry partners to develop 5g requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5g technologies we expect that 5g technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4g lte technology lower latency and enable our network to handle more traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5g fixed wireless broadband network in the us based on the outcome of our precommercial trials in 2017 we announced in november 2017 that we will commercially launch 5g wireless residential broadband services in three to five us markets in 2018 

our intelligent edge network is aggressively evolving our network architecture to a multiuse platform built on deep fiber penetration providing increased virtualization and opportunities for edge computing services 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice video and data communications services we are licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the us 

in 2017 we entered into transactions to acquire nextlink wireless llc nextlink and straight path communications inc straight path each of which hold millimeterwave spectrum licenses the nextlink acquisition closed on january 10 2018 the straight path acquisition  is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018  the spectrum acquired as part of these transactions will be used for our 5g technology deployment in the 28 and 39 ghz bands 

in january 2015 the fcc completed an auction of 65 mhz of spectrum in the aws3 band we participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses for which we paid cash of approximately 104 billion the fcc granted us these spectrum licenses in april 2015 

we are aggressively refarming 3g bands on 800 mhz and pcs bands for 4g lte use we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed we can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur in addition to spectrum we believe that future demand will also be met as we increase the density of our networks and deploy advanced technologies 

from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future in certain cases we have entered into intra market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases require us to obtain governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses 

additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2017 verizon annual report to shareowners in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

network equipment and buildout 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing lte network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells as we densify our network we follow a similar process for small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our network operations we utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites 

during march 2015 we completed a transaction with american tower corporation american tower pursuant to which american tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of 50 billion under the terms of the lease agreements american tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years as the leases expire american tower has fixedprice purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms as part of this transaction we also sold 162 towers for 01 billion we have subleased capacity on the towers from american tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates with options to renew 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline businesses through the wireless business group a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon wireless’ solutions for medium and large business and verizon wirelines enterprise solutions group which serves all of our government customers our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while controlling customer acquisition costs 

our direct channel includes our businesstobusiness sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy we continue to redesign our retail stores nationwide into the next gen design which focuses on our customers evolving digital lifestyle we also have verizon destination stores in various major metropolitan areas which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the us as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also have relationships with highprofile national retailers which sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services and with various drugstore chains which sell our prepaid products and services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including resellers that buy from us competition remains intense as a result of saturation in the wireless market increased network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

 

we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans these payment options include device payment plans which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and device leasing arrangements historically wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby in exchange for the customer entering into a fixedterm service agreement the wireless service provider significantly and in some cases fully subsidized the customer’s device purchase wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans we and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 80 of our postpaid phone base on unsubsidized service pricing plans compared with approximately 67 at december 31 2016 as of january 2017 we no longer offer consumers new fixedterm service plans for phones however we continue to service existing plans and provide these plans to business customers   

 

 

 

 

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry these include the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies that bundle the services of wireless and cable competitors 



background

partner solutions provides the following key services to both wireless and wireline carriers 

 

 

 

business markets 

business markets offers tailored voice and networking products fios services ip networking advanced voice solutions security and managed information technology it services to usbased small and medium businesses state and local governments and educational institutions in 2017 business markets revenues were 36 billion representing approximately 12 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

in addition to the traditional voice and networking products and fios services noted in the consumer markets section above business markets also offers traditional circuitbased network products and services advanced networking solutions advanced communications services and security services as noted in the enterprise solutions section above 

network 

verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the us and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers with the advancement of our intelligent edge network we are evolving our network architecture around a multiuse common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies and will we believe drive even greater levels of cost efficiency we expect that the new architecture will improve our 4g lte coverage speed the deployment of 5g technology deliver highspeed fios broadband to homes and businesses and create new enterprise opportunities in the business market 

 

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network the pon infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services 

 

global business is rapidly evolving to an everythingasaservice model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services with the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy verizon is creating a single highcapacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology the result is a global ip network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands 

we believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiberbased networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential small to medium business government and enterprise customers 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers over the top providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions   

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and to a lesser extent the global wholesale market we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

 

 

 

 

in the consumer markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include fios internet tv and voice services in addition in 2017 we introduced market offers targeted to our verizon wireless customers several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a tv computer tablet or mobile phone we expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to over the top offerings 

we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

in the enterprise solutions market competition remains intense primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence we compete in this area with system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers in addition some of the biggest companies in it services are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

in the partner solutions business we serve as a global wholesale partner that connects customers to the digital world partner solutions competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

in business markets customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve solution speed and simplicity with a consumerlike look and feel are becoming key differentiators for both our smb and sled customers smb customers are seeking full lifecycle offers that radically simplify the process of starting running and growing their businesses while sled customers want similar services that are high quality and secure that enable material improvement in citizen outreach public safety and city infrastructure performance all of which help attract inward investment and community prosperity

regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional companies many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

federal regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services traditionally the fcc recognized broadband internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations in 2015 the fcc declared that broadband internet access services are telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act in december 2017 the fcc adopted an order reversing the 2015 title ii order to return to light touch regulation of broadband internet access services regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when where and how they want and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to federal state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including wireline wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the media and iot space at the federal level our voice business is subject to the fccs privacy requirements oversight of broadband internet access privacy and data security which had shifted from the federal trade commission ftc to the fcc following the fccs adoption of its 2015 title ii order will return to the ftc as a result of the fccs repeal of the 2015 title ii order in december 2017 generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level in addition a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for noncompliance 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments in april 2017 the fcc issued an order which is currently under appeal that revised the regulatory structure for business data services eliminating tariffing obligations and ex ante price regulations in markets the fcc determined to be competitive the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate 

state regulation and local regulation 

wireless services 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

wireline services 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated 

in addition as a video services operator in many states verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 



reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities these reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville ny which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the site into its formerly utilized sites remedial action program as a result the ace has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site an adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services dropping down in price plans or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as fiber switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media and telematics businesses impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example we are subject to federal state and international laws related to privacy and data protection a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for noncompliance in an order adopted by the fcc in december 2017 the fcc repealed its 2015 title ii order that had nullified its longstanding light touch approach to regulating broadband internet access services and reclassified these services as telecommunications services subject to utilitiesstyle common carriage regulation the december 2017 order could be appealed or otherwise challenged the outcome and timing of any such appeal or challenge remains uncertain in addition we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled open access fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice moreover certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years further the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks which individually or in the aggregate have been material to verizons operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack moreover our increasing presence in the iot industry with offerings of telematics products and services including vehicle telematics could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and could further result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2017  verizon had approximately 1082 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness as well as approximately 89 billion  of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 155400  employees and approximately 197000 retirees as of december 31 2017  eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the patient protection and affordable care act increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 23  of our workforce was represented by labor unions while we have labor contracts in place with these unions with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations in addition while less than 1 of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

we purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from apple samsung motorola mobility google lg electronics and htc 

a key component of all wireless devices is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the device the lte chipsets used in our 4g lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own 4g lte chipset technology to support code division multiple access cdma1xrtt and evdo technologies with and without 4g lte most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on qualcomm incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

network 

we have the largest 4g lte and 3g evdo networks of any service provider in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of december 31 2016 our 4g lte network covered approximately 314 million people in the united states including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners we currently have 21 lte in rural america partners that provide 4g lte coverage to an area covering approximately three million people 

the reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth the depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage 

we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions including video permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to upgrade our network primarily to increase its capacity and density by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing aws spectrum we are also exploring strategic opportunities to increase our network capacity and efficiency through selective acquisitions of spectrum licenses 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in critical locations 

  

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the united states certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g cdma 4g lte provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technologies 

in 2014 we commercially launched our mobile volte service hd calling enabled by volte is now being used in addition to cdma technology to provide voice calling services to our customers 

we are committed to developing and deploying 5g wireless technology we are densifying our 4g lte network to add capacity and preposition us for 5g technology we launched the verizon 5g technology forum with key industry partners to develop 5g requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5g technologies we believe that 5g technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4g lte technology lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows based on the outcome of our ongoing precommercial trials we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5g fixed wireless broadband network in the united states we expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the united states 

in january 2015 the federal communications commission fcc completed an auction of 65 mhz of spectrum in the aws3 band we participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses for which we paid cash of approximately 104 billion the fcc granted us these spectrum licenses in april 2015 

we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed additional spectrum may also allow us to offer new products enabled by advances in technology including emerging 5g and iot services we can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur in march 2016 the fcc commenced a voluntary incentive auction of television broadcast spectrum in the 600 mhz frequency range the auction has finished the reverse and forward clock phases any results will be disclosed by the fcc after the completion of the assignment phase and after the fcc announces the close of the auction by public notice 

since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future in other cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2016 verizon annual report to shareowners in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of verizon communications inc and subsidiaries which is incorporated by reference into this report 

network equipment and buildout 

nokia and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells our primary cdma cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are nokia which provides more than half of our cdma cell site equipment and ericsson which provides nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely on nokia and ericsson for our switching equipment 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells as we densify our network we follow a similar process for small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation american tower as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites 

during march 2015 we completed a transaction with american tower pursuant to which american tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of 50 billion under the terms of the lease agreements american 

  

tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years as the leases expire american tower has fixedprice purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms as part of this transaction we also sold 162 towers for 01 billion we have subleased capacity on the towers from american tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates with options to renew 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline business units through the wireless business group a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon wireless’ solutions for medium and large business and government customers our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy we have verizon destination stores in various major metropolitan areas which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives these stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “smart stores” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale in addition our direct channel includes our businesstobusiness sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service plans 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also have relationships with highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including resellers that buy from us competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

 we and other wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans these payment options include device payment plans 

  

which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and device leasing arrangements historically wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby in exchange for the customer entering into a fixedterm service agreement the wireless service provider significantly and in some cases fully subsidized the customer’s device purchase wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans we and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy 

 

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

 

 background 

our wireline segment provides voice data and video communications products and enhanced services we provide these products and services to consumers in the united states as well as to carriers businesses and government customers both in the united states and around the world in 2016 wireline revenues were 313 billion representing approximately 25 of verizon’s aggregate revenues

global enterprise 

global enterprise offers strategic services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers including multinational corporations as well as state and federal government customers global enterprise markets these services through verizon enterprise solutions in 2016 global enterprise revenues were 116 billion representing approximately 37 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

verizon enterprise solutions offers an array of advanced information and communication technology services including global internet protocol ip network cloud and it solutions and business communications iot data security and mobility services 

 

   

  

  

  

 global wholesale 

global wholesale provides communications services including data voice local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local long distance wireless and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers in 2016 global wholesale revenues were 50 billion representing approximately 16 of wireline’s aggregate revenues a portion of global wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies most of which compete directly with us 

global wholesale provides the following services which it jointly markets with verizon’s other business units through verizon enterprise solutions 

 

 data services also include certain valueadded business services which leverage many of the same offerings available in the global enterprise portfolio including 

 

  

  

  

  

 network 

verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the united states and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers 

 

   

while deployed initially as a consumer broadband network the pon infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector especially as businesses increasingly migrate to ethernetbased access services 

 

 global business is rapidly evolving to an “everythingasaservice” model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services with the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy verizon is creating a single highcapacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology the result is a global ip network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands 

we believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiberbased networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent the global wholesale markets we compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

  

   

in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers in addition customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a tv computer tablet or mobile phone 

in the global enterprise market the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

we also compete with competitive local exchange carriers clecs our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers

digital media and interactive entertainment 

verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising we have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer we believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth through various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video streaming products and services we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers including the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 internet of things and telematics 

the adoption of iot technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging iot technologies to increase efficiency gain better customer insights facilitate compliance with regulations and build new business models although iot growth is expanding broadly adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries as well as the fields of smart communities healthcare utilities and energy management we are building our growth capabilities in the iot market by developing business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity platform and solution layers for example we have developed iot solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities farms and other purveyors of food and agriculture drug companies and others with complex supply chains in addition our iot customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth 

our strategy to simplify iot technology and accelerate its adoption also includes thingspace an iot platform thingspace is designed to help developers create test manage and market iotbased solutions aimed at major vertical markets such as energy health care and connected cities thingspace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces and partner development kits in october 2016 we acquired sensity systems inc a leading provider of iot solutions for smart communities in order to add a leading comprehensive suite of smart city solutions

 we own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad we also actively grant licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us we do not believe that the loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

we periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services 

 

 information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2016 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  acquisitions and divestitures” which is incorporated by reference into this report 

 

 regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional companies many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

federal regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of our wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services traditionally the fcc recognized that broadband internet access services as “information services” subject to a “light touch” regulatory approach rather than to the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations in 2015 the fcc reversed course and declared that broadband internet access services are “telecommunications services” subject to common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act this decision created uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services it created a risk that such regulation would limit the ways that broadband internet access service providers structure their business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation the fcc’s decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals but may be subject to further challenge in the courts in addition congress and the fcc are likely to continue to debate the proper scope of such regulations regardless of regulation verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when where and how they want and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment 

  

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be “common carrier” services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to federal state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business including voice wireless broadband and the development and roll out of new products such as those in the iot space at the federal level much of our business is subject to the fcc’s privacy and data security requirements in november 2016 the fcc released new privacy and data security rules that will apply to all telecommunications services including our fixed and mobile voice and broadband services other parts of our business are subject to the privacy and data security oversight of other federal regulators including the federal trade commission generally attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level in addition a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for noncompliance 

public safety and cybersecurity 

the fcc has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media broadcastcable and wireless emergency alerting services in response to recent cyber attacks however the fcc or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline “business data services” and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services and both makes and receives interconnection payments the fcc has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate 

state regulation and local regulation 

wireless services 

the act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

wireline services 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an “incumbent local exchange carrier” in nine states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated in addition as a video services operator in many states verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

  

 reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities these reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville ny which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the site into its formerly utilized sites remedial action program as a result the ace has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site an adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation 

 

 see part iii item 10 “directors executive officers and corporate governance” of this annual report on form 10k for information about our executive officers 

 

 as of december 31 2016 verizon and its subsidiaries had approximately 160900 employees unions represent approximately 23 of our employees 

 

 we make available free of charge on our website our annual reports on form 10k and form sd quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports at httpwwwverizoncomaboutinvestors 

  

 in this report we have made forwardlooking statements these statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties forwardlooking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations forwardlooking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “hopes” or similar expressions for those statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the following important factors along with those discussed elsewhere in this report and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forwardlooking statements

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example we are subject to federal state and international laws related to privacy and data protection a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for noncompliance in addition in its order imposing socalled “network neutrality” regulations the fcc reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding “light touch” approach and “reclassified” broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilitiesstyle common carriage regulation while the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain these rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation these rules may be subject to further challenge in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in congress and the fcc but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain as another example we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice moreover certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years further the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks which individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack moreover our increasing presence in the iot industry with offerings of telematics products and services including vehicle telematics could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services in addition a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information could result in lawsuits and government claims investigations or proceedings any of these occurrences could damage our reputation adversely impact customer and investor confidence and could further result in a material adverse effect on verizon’s results of operation or financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery 

  

planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2016 verizon had approximately 1081 billion of outstanding indebtedness as well as approximately 89 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our term loan agreements require verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon’s credit ratings are at or above a certain level which could limit verizon’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 160900 employees and approximately 201000 retirees as of december 31 2016 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the patient protection and affordable care act increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 23 of our workforce was represented by labor unions while less than 1 of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline are represented by unions we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

customers on our fixedterm service plans have historically paid higher fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices under the verizon device payment program formerly known as verizon edge our eligible wireless customers purchase phones or tablets at unsubsidized prices on an installment basis a device installment plan customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower service fees unsubsidized service pricing as compared to those under our fixedterm service plans generally customers entering into device installment agreements on or after june 1 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device installment agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device however certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down the minimum percentage of their device installment plan and trading in their device 

in august 2015 we launched a simplified shared data plan the verizon plan that offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a customer’s account new customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail or by using their own compatible device in addition our current customers have the option of either moving to the verizon plan subject to certain restrictions or keeping their existing plan 

we offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of our devices our messaging services enable our customers to send and receive text picture and video messages in addition access to the internet is available on all of our smartphones and nearly all of our basic phones we also offer service that enables our customers to access the internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4g lte or 3g evdo modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service such as usb modems jetpacks tm and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile wifi connection

wireless devices 

we offer several categories of wireless devices including smartphones and basic phones tablets and other internet access devices 

smartphones and basic phones  all of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4g lte andor 3g evdo highspeed data services and run on various operating platforms such as apple ios google android windows phone os and blackberry os most of the basic phones we offer are 3g evdoenabled and have htmlbrowsing capability 

tablets and other internet devices we offer tablets from multiple manufacturers all of which can access the internet via our 4g lte network or a wifi connection the tablets run primarily on the apple ios google android or microsoft windows operating systems in addition we offer dedicated devices which we refer to as jetpacks that provide a mobile wifi 4g lte andor 3g evdo connection and are capable of connecting multiple wifi enabled devices to the internet at one time our customers can also access the internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards usb modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4g lte and 3g evdo mobile broadband modules during 2015 we continued to experience strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase 

we purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from apple motorola mobility samsung lg electronics blackberry and htc 

a key component of all wireless devices is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the device the lte chipsets used in our 4g lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own 4g lte chipset technology to support cdma1xrtt and evdo technologies with and without 4g lte most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on qualcomm incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

network 

we have the largest 4g lte and 3g evdo networks of any service provider in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of december 31 2015 our 4g lte network covered approximately 312 million people in the us including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners we currently have 21 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4g lte coverage to approximately three million people and to date all participants have commenced 4g lte operations on their networks 

the reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth the depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage 

we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions including video and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to upgrade our network primarily to increase its capacity and density by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing aws spectrum we are also exploring strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant multiprotocol label switching backbone network in all critical locations 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the united states certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated atwill by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g code division multiple access cdma 4g lte provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3g technologies 

  

in 2014 we commercially launched our mobile voice over internet protocol voip service known as voice over lte volte advanced calling 10 a first generation suite of services enabled by volte is now being used in addition to cdma technology to provide voice calling services to our customers 

in 2015 we announced our commitment to developing and deploying 5g wireless technology we launched the verizon 5g technology forum with key industry partners to develop 5g requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5g technologies we believe that 5g technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4g lte technology lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of internetconnected devices grows we plan to launch field technology trials in 2016 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the united states 

in january 2015 the federal communications commission fcc completed an auction of 65 mhz of spectrum in the aws3 band we participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses for which we paid cash of approximately 104 billion the fcc granted us these spectrum licenses in april 2015 

we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive we can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur the fcc will be auctioning television broadcast spectrum in the 600 mhz frequency range through a voluntary incentive auction that will take place in two phases in the first phase television broadcasters participating in the auction process will “sell” their rights to use such spectrum to the fcc in the second phase the fcc will “resell” that spectrum to various auction participants including wireless service providers and other potential bidders the incentive auction is scheduled to begin on march 29 2016 

since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future in other cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions 

network equipment and buildout 

alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells our primary cdma cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cdma cell site equipment and nokia solutions and networks nsn and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely on alcatellucent nsn and ericsson for our switching equipment in january 2016 nokia corporation acquired alcatellucent and combined operations 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for macro cell sites as we densify our network we follow a similar process for small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation american tower as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites 

during march 2015 we completed a transaction with american tower pursuant to which american tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of 50 billion under the terms of the lease agreements american tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years as the leases expire american tower has fixedprice purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms as part of this transaction we also sold 162 towers for 01 billion we have subleased capacity on the towers from american tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates with options to renew 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline business units through the wireless business group a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon wireless’ solutions for medium and large business and government customers our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

  

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy we have opened verizon destination stores in various major metropolitan areas which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives these stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “smart stores” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale in addition our direct channel includes our businesstobusiness sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service plans 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also utilize highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att inc att sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc tmobile usa as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service as well as alternative means of accessing video content 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

 many wireless service providers as well as equipment manufacturers offer device payment options that decouple service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans these payment options include device installment plans which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time and device leasing arrangements historically wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby in exchange for the customer entering into a fixedterm service agreement the wireless service providers significantly and in some cases fully subsidized the customer’s device purchase wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device installment plans we and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued the use of device subsidies as a result of the increased penetration of device installment plans we expect the number of customers on plans with unsubsidized service pricing to continue to grow in 2016 we compete in this area by offering our customers services and devices that we believe they will regard as the best available value for the price while meeting their wireless service needs 

 

   

longterm relationships with our customers we offer verizon smart rewards which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their accountrelated interactions with verizon wireless the program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from wellknown brands as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues 

 

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors

we believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiberbased networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent the global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

   

  

 in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers in addition customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a tv computer tablet or mobile phone 

in the global enterprise market the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are making strategic acquisitions divesting nonstrategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

we also compete with competitive local exchange carriers clecs our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers 

 

 technology developments interconnected markets shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for verizon we are transforming around the capabilities of our highperforming networks with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve develop new business models through global platforms in video and iot and create certain opportunities in applications and content for incremental monetization to execute this strategy we have created an organization devoted to the development of new products and incubation of new businesses this organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their wireless and wireline needs several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the following areas 

 

 we believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth we have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks cdns video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity for example in 2015 we launched go90 a mobilefirst social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for adsupported mobile video streaming digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events popular web and television content as well as original content in january 2016 we introduced freebee data a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the provider’s mobile content or sponsor specific consumer actions on a perclick basis all free of data charges to the customer in february 2016 we announced we would offer retail postpaid verizon wireless customers video streaming in go90 over our 4g lte network free of data charges via the freebee data 360 sponsored data service customers must have the latest version of the go90 application to take advantage of this offer 

we also began using multimedia broadcast multicast service technology to develop our lte multicast service which we used to deliver live events in go90 in 2015 this service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering regardless of the number of devices using the service in order to continue to meet the changing needs of our customers we also are developing an ip television service we also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that does not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement for example our nfl agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4g lte network without authenticating back to any subscription 

  

we continue to invest in verizon digital media services which offers a scalable platform for delivering content including live broadcasts video on demand games software and websites to our customers on their devices at any time as the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content there is an increasing need for a stable highquality video delivery platform we are focused on providing a simple endtoend global platform for the delivery of media to customers which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem this platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies as well as businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the internet we also expect through this platform to further integrate our fios and wireless offerings 

connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth as customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of broadband data and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase our fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and reliability broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of overthetop video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number of connected homes and devices continues to grow 

 

 through verizon telematics we provide connectivity and telematics to manufacturers such as mercedesbenz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently our suite of realtime vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers our platform enables factory and aftermarketinstalled automotive safety and security features as well as locationbased services and vehicle diagnostics we provide usagebased data services to new vehicles in the united states china and europe our networkfleet solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout north america with realtime access to data that yields operational efficiencies increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety we also provide this service to over 28900 vehicles operated by verizon we are further expanding our telematics portfolio to add asset tracking capabilities 

during the third quarter of 2015 we announced the availability of hum an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service to consumers with this subscriptionbased service drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles access to live assistance and will be able to request roadside assistance with gps accuracy when needed hum also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions 

 

 we believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company 

 

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such thirdparty licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional companies many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

fcc regulation 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of verizon’s wireless operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand it can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the fcc those processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon’s wireless licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband services traditionally the fcc has recognized that broadband internet access services are “information services” subject to a “light touch” regulatory approach rather than the traditional utilitiesstyle regulations that apply to traditional voice services in its order imposing socalled “network neutrality” rules the fcc reversed course in 2015 and declared that broadband internet access services will now be treated as “telecommunications services” subject to common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act of 1934 this decision creates uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services going forward these regulations will limit the ways that broadband internet access service providers can structure business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions including rate regulation which could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation the fcc’s decision is being challenged in court and the proper scope of such regulations is also being debated in congress verizon remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when where and how they want and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment verizon opposes the shift to utilities style regulation however which we believe is unnecessary unlawful and harmful to the broader internet ecosystem and our customers 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be “common carrier” services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in addition the act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise and the fcc has adopted rules that interpret and implement this requirement in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities 

  

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services in many instances verizon makes payments to other providers and in turn verizon receives some payments from other carriers in 2011 the fcc issued a broad reform order changing among other things the framework for many of the perminute rates that carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic the new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline “special access” and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services for example on the wireline side verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers on the wireless side verizon purchases special access and other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers in addition as required by the act verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes these facilities and services available to other network providers 

universal service 

the communications act charges the fcc with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services including rural and other highcost areas low income subscribers schools and libraries rural healthcare organizations and deaf and hardofhearing individuals the fcc established different subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals to pay for these programs the fcc requires contributions from providers such as verizon based on reported revenues for certain services verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them 

state regulation and local regulation 

wireless services 

the communications act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

wireline services 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an “incumbent local exchange carrier” in 13 states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated in addition as a video services operator in many states verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and to comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

 

 reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities these reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville ny which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the site into its formerly utilized sites remedial action program as a result the ace has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site an adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation

 i tem 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings in addition wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing promotions incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment and handsets that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims are frequently made in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example in its order imposing socalled “network neutrality” regulations the fcc reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding “light touch” approach and “reclassified” broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilitiesstyle common carriage regulation while the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain these rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation these rules are being challenged in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in congress but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain as another example we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice moreover certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years further the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks which individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

the inability to operate our networks and systems or those of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses to verizon andor a loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack in addition if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data sensitive information about verizon and intellectual property or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks it could result in lawsuits government claims investigations or proceedings and damage to our reputation which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the 

  

equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

verizon has significant debt which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2015 verizon had approximately 1102 billion of outstanding indebtedness as well as approximately 79 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the term loan agreement verizon entered into in connection with the wireless transaction requires verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon’s credit ratings are at or above a certain level which could limit verizon’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 177700 employees and approximately 203000 retirees as of december 31 2015 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our workforce was represented by labor unions labor contracts covering approximately 36300 employees of our wireline business expired on august 1 2015 we continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts during the course of these negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage depending on the outcome of the negotiations we may incur additional costs in addition while less than 1 of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses are represented by unions we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in 

  

addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

 background 

our wireless segment is primarily comprised of cellco partnership doing business as verizon wireless cellco partnership was formed as a joint venture in april 2000 by the combination of the united states us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone on september 2 2013 verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with vodafone and vodafone 4 limited pursuant to which verizon agreed to acquire all of vodafone’s indirect 45 interest in verizon wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately 130 billion the wireless transaction we completed the wireless transaction on february 21 2014 and as a result we acquired 100 ownership of verizon wireless the consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and verizon common stock

wireless devices 

we offer several categories of wireless devices including smartphones and basic phones tablets and other internet access devices 

smartphones and basic phones  nearly all of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4g lte andor 3g evdo highspeed data services and run on various operating platforms such as apple ios google android blackberry os and windows phone os most of the basic phones we offer are 3g evdoenabled and have htmlbrowsing capability 

tablets and other internet devices we offer tablets from multiple manufacturers all of which can access the internet via our 4g lte network or a wifi connection the tablets run primarily on the apple ios google android or microsoft windows operating systems in addition we offer dedicated devices which we refer to as jetpacks that provide a mobile wifi 4g lte andor 3g evdo connection and are capable of connecting multiple wifi enabled devices to the internet at one time our customers can also access the internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their 

  

computers via data cards usb modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4g lte and 3g evdo mobile broadband modules during 2014 we continued to experience strong customer demand for tablets and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase 

we purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from apple motorola mobility samsung lg electronics blackberry and htc 

a key component of all wireless devices is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the device the lte chipsets used in our 4g lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own 4g lte chipset to support cdma1xrtt and evdo technologies with and without 4g lte most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on qualcomm incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

network 

we have the largest 4g lte and 3g evdo networks of any service provider in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of january 22 2015 our 4g lte network covered approximately 309 million people in the us including those in areas served by our lte in rural america partners we currently have 21 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4g lte coverage to approximately three million people and to date eighteen participants have commenced 4g lte operations on such networks 

the foundation of our continued success is network reliability which is the hallmark of the verizon brand we believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services which will fuel profitable growth the depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage 

in 2014 we announced the deployment of aws spectrum in our 4g lte network this additional bandwidth which we refer to and brand as xlte provides additional network capacity and is currently available in more than 400 markets nearly all 4g lte devices that we currently sell can operate on xlte 

we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions including video and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to upgrade our network primarily to increase its capacity and density by utilizing small cell technology inbuilding solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing aws spectrum we are also exploring strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the united states certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated atwill by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g code division multiple access cdma 4g lte provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3g technologies 

in 2014 we commercially launched our mobile voice over internet protocol voip service known as voice over lte volte advanced calling 10 is a first generation suite of services enabled by volte which is a technology now being used in addition to cdma technology to provide voice calling services to our customers 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service to mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone multiprotocol label switching network in all critical locations 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum portions of the 700 mhz upper c band and aws spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the united states 

  

we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive we can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the federal communications commission fcc if and when future fcc spectrum auctions occur on january 29 2015 the fcc completed an auction of 65 mhz of spectrum which it identified as the aws3 band verizon participated in that auction and was the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses for which we will pay approximately 104 billion during the fourth quarter of 2014 we made a deposit of 09 billion related to our participation in this auction on february 13 2015 we made a down payment of 12 billion for these spectrum licenses verizon has submitted an application for these licenses and must complete payment for them in the first quarter of 2015 in addition congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment and funding of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction through the use of voluntary incentive auctions by 2022 of portions of the existing television broadcast spectrum in the 600 mhz band the incentive auction related to such spectrum is expected to take place in 2016 although the specific timing of this and other auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings 

since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others from time to time we exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future in other cases we have entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding spectrum license transactions 

network equipment and buildout 

alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells our primary cdma cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cdma cell site equipment and nokia solutions and networks nsn and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely on alcatellucent nsn and ericsson for our switching equipment 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals for macro sites small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation american tower as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites 

on february 5 2015 we announced an agreement with american tower pursuant to which american tower will have the exclusive rights to lease and operate over 11300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of 50 billion under the terms of the leases american tower will have exclusive rights to lease and operate the towers over an average term of approximately 28 years as part of this transaction we will also sell 165 towers for 01 billion we will sublease capacity on the towers from american tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates with options to renew as the leases expire american tower will have fixedprice purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms this transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions is expected to close during the first half of 2015 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline business units through verizon enterprise solutions a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon’s solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy our direct channel which includes our businesstobusiness sales operations and systems organization is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service plans 

in 2013 we opened our first verizon destination store at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and in 2014 we opened two additional destination stores in chicago and houston these stores focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives these stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into “smart stores” which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones as the verizon destination stores but on a smaller scale in addition our online store has also been redesigned to deliver a consistent shopping experience for customers whether accessing the store via their desktop or mobile device 

  

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also utilize highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services we also have entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a standalone basis or bundled with their services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att sprint corporation and tmobile usa as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us competition has intensified and we expect it to remain intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels network investment by our competitors the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services in addition to nontraditional offerings in mobile data for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service or the provision of alternative means of consuming video content in a nonlinear format 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

 

 background 

our wireline segment provides voice data and video communications products and enhanced services including broadband video and data corporate networking solutions data center and cloud services security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services we provide these products and services to consumers in the united states as well as to carriers businesses and government customers both in the united states and around the world in 2014 wireline revenues were 384 billion representing approximately 30 of verizon’s aggregate revenues 

wireline service and product offerings 

we organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings – mass markets global enterprise and global wholesale 

in 2014 our wireline segment sold a nonstrategic business which provides communications solutions to a variety of government agencies accordingly the historical wireline results for these operations which were not material to our consolidated financial statements or segment results of operations have been reclassified to corporate eliminations and other to reflect comparable segment operating results 

on february 5 2015 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement with frontier communications corporation frontier pursuant to which verizon will sell its local exchange business and related landline activities in california florida and texas including fios internet and video customers switched and special access lines and highspeed internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states for approximately 105 billion the transaction which includes the acquisition by frontier of the equity interests of verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs in california florida and texas does not involve any assets or liabilities of verizon wireless the assets and liabilities that will be sold are currently included in verizon’s continuing operations as part of the transaction frontier will assume 06 billion of indebtedness from verizon the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including among others receipt of state and federal telecommunications regulatory approvals and we expect this transaction to close during the first half of 2016 

the transaction will result in frontier acquiring approximately 15 million fios internet subscribers 12 million fios video subscribers and the related ilec businesses from verizon this business generated revenues of approximately 54 billion excluding revenue with affiliates for verizon in 2013 which is the most recent year for which audited standalone financial statements are currently available 

in 2012 verizon acquired hughes telematics inc hughes telematics the acquisition has accelerated our ability to bring more telematics offerings to market for existing and new customers these offerings include our suite of realtime vehicle communications services and applications which connect automobiles with content applications and services we provide services to new vehicles in the united states china and europe 

mass markets 

mass markets operations provide broadband services including highspeed internet fios internet and fios video services local exchange basic service and enduser access and long distance including regional toll voice services to residential and small business subscribers in 2014 mass markets revenues were 180 billion representing approximately 47 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

data services we offer fios broadband and highspeed internet data products with varying throughput speeds including fios quantum which includes speeds of 50 megabytes per second mbps or more we believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video they will require increased broadband speeds with our fios quantum broadband service and certain other data services our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds which we refer to as speedmatch sm  of up to 500 mbps as of december 31 2014 approximately 59 of our fios internet subscribers subscribed to fios quantum as more data storage and in some cases processing is moved to the cloud we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads 

in 2014 we introduced the fios quantum gateway wifi router this router uses dualband technology which allows users to perform both high and low bandwidth activities and enables a more seamless internet experience even when using multiple devices 

video services we offer video service over our fiberoptic network as of december 31 2014 fios video was available to approximately 15 million homes across 12 states as well as the district of columbia

global wholesale 

global wholesale provides communications services including data voice local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local long distance and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers in 2014 global wholesale revenues were 62 billion representing approximately 16 of wireline’s aggregate revenues a portion of global wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunications companies most of which compete directly with us 

global wholesale provides the following services which it jointly markets with verizon’s other business units through verizon enterprise solutions 

 

 new ethernet connectivity in the united states represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale as customers anticipate higher capacity demands in the future these customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing to ethernet which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones mobile broadband and mobile video global wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 4g and 3g networks

other wireline services we provide include local exchange and long distance services used by former mci mass market customers and operator services in 2014 other revenues were 05 billion representing approximately 1 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

network 

to provide services to our customers we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the united states and around the world 

 

 the passive optical network technology upon which the fios network is deployed positions verizon to meet growing bandwidth requirements our network architecture provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development for example new optical terminals can be added to the fibertothepremise network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction select field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second gbps and when a more advanced next generation technology has been connected to the fiberoptic network connection speeds of 10 gbps have been reached demonstrating the significant growth capacity built into the fios platform 

additionally this advanced optical network is also finding increased application opportunities in the business sector especially as the industry seeks to migrate to ethernetbased access services 

 

 global ip traffic has increased substantially over the last five years and is expected to continue to grow significantly this global business is also rapidly evolving to an “everythingasaservice” model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services with the continued deployment of its packet optical transport strategy verizon is creating a single highcapacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology the result is a global ip network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands 

in 2014 a number of key infrastructure enhancements and technology upgrades were designed and deployed with fios quantum we introduced speedmatch and pushed our top tier fios service offering to 500 mbps we believe that our continued focus on advancing our fiberbased networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent the global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

   

 in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

we expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” 

in the global enterprise market the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are either making strategic acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

 

 technology developments interconnected markets shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for verizon our vision is to be a globallyconnected solutions company our market solutions are designed to deliver compelling products and services strengthen our competitive advantage in the marketplace and drive a highquality experience for our customers to take advantage of these market trends we have undertaken several strategic initiatives to further develop innovative products and services and enhance our market agility in the following areas of focus 

 

 customers are increasingly consuming large amounts of broadband data as connected devices and associated online applications continue to experience significant growth and we expect broadband usage to continue to increase our fios network positions us in the industry with leading broadband speeds and reliability broadband represents a growth opportunity for us as the use of overthetop video and user generated content and data accelerates and the number of connected homes and devices continues to grow 

 

   

additionally we are a partner in a pilot project which will put a 120mile fully automated highway system in place in michigan with sensors and cameras communicating with cars to show the possibilities of what can be accomplished with realtime vehicle communications services we expect this project will show improvements in areas such as energy consumption and safety 

during the second quarter of 2015 we expect verizon vehicle a vehicle information and technology service to be available to consumers with this subscriptionbased service drivers will have diagnostic technology in their vehicles access to live assistance at the press of a button and will be able to request roadside assistance with gps accuracy when needed verizon vehicle also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions 

 

  

 our cloud infrastructure enables realtime analytical capabilities for our m2m customers providing an endtoend capability where customers can store process and analyze large amounts of data on a realtime basis our cloud infrastructure also has the ability to handle multiple instances of an application providing global support and availability of the applications without increased latency the integration of our cloud infrastructure with our telematics assets provides our customers with new and innovative service capabilities that are scalable and which we believe are operationally superior to other bifurcated approaches 

 

 we believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue increasing revenue of existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company 

 

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such thirdparty licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 regulatory and competitive landscape 

verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies traditional telephone companies cable companies internet service providers software and application providers and other nontraditional companies many of these companies have strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon for many services offered by verizon the fcc is our primary regulator the fcc has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the communications act of 1934 as amended communications act or act other verizon services are subject to state and local regulation 

fcc regulation 

broadband 

verizon offers many different broadband and internet access services the fcc has adopted a series of orders that impose lesser regulatory requirements on broadband services than apply to older voice and slower data services in addition the fcc concluded that both wireline and wireless broadband internet access services qualify as largely deregulated information services our broadband internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose socalled “network neutrality” rules including the potential application of common carriage regulation under title ii of the communications act verizon has been and remains committed to the open internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when where and how they want our commitment applies to broadband internet access services provided over both our wireline and wireless networks and can be found on our website at httpresponsibilityverizoncombroadbandcommitment 

video 

verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators and these rules also generally apply to verizon in addition the act generally requires companies to obtain a local cable franchise and the fcc has adopted rules that interpret and implement this requirement in areas where verizon offers its facilitiesbased multichannel video services verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities 

wireline voice 

verizon offers many different wireline voice services including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on newer technologies such as voip for regulatory purposes legacy telephone services are generally considered to be “common carrier” services common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates terms and conditions and other aspects of the services the fcc has not decided the regulatory classification of voip but has said voip service providers must comply with certain rules such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements 

wireless services 

the fcc regulates several aspects of verizon wireless’ operations generally the fcc has jurisdiction over the construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems and all wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum the assignment and distribution of which is subject to fcc oversight verizon wireless anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand it can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others or by participating in a competitive bidding process for new spectrum from the fcc both processes are subject to certain reviews approvals and potential conditions 

today verizon wireless holds fcc spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services fcc spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years at which time they are subject to renewal while the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon wireless’ licenses challenges could be raised in the future if a wireless license was revoked or not renewed verizon wireless would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license some of our licenses require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice subject to certain technical limitations the fcc has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers including construction and geographic coverage requirements technical operating standards provision of enhanced 911 services roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities 

intercarrier compensation and network access 

the fcc regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic particularly traditional wireline traffic over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services in many instances verizon makes payments to other providers and in turn verizon receives some payments from other carriers in 2011 the fcc issued a broad reform order changing among other things the framework for many of the perminute rates that carriers charge each other for the exchange of voice traffic the new rules gradually reduce many of these rates to zero this order is subject to pending reconsideration petitions and appeals the fcc also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for 

  

certain wireline “special access” and other services and network facilities verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services for example on the wireline side verizon sells wholesale circuits to other voice and data service providers on the wireless side verizon purchases special access and other services to transport traffic to and from cell towers in addition as required by the act verizon unbundles certain wireline network elements and makes these facilities and services available to other network providers 

universal service 

the communications act charges the fcc with ensuring that certain groups and areas have access to communications services including rural and other highcost areas low income subscribers schools and libraries rural healthcare organizations and deaf and hardofhearing individuals the fcc established different subsidy and discount programs to achieve these goals to pay for these programs the fcc requires contributions from providers such as verizon based on reported revenues for certain services verizon also receives some payments from some of these programs but is a net payer into them 

state regulation and local regulation 

wireline services 

state public utility commissions regulate verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters verizon operates as an “incumbent local exchange carrier” in 13 states and the district of columbia these incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated in addition as a video services operator in many states verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities or in some cases a statewide franchise and to comply with certain onetime and ongoing obligations as a result 

wireless services 

the communications act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers the act does not prohibit states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service for example some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues eg use of wireless handsets while driving and taxation matters in addition wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process 

 

 reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities these reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville ny which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the site into its formerly utilized sites remedial action program as a result the ace has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site an adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation 

 

 see part iii item 10 “directors executive officers and corporate governance” of this annual report on form 10k for information about our executive officers

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment and handsets that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services as another example we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice in addition our broadband internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose socalled “network neutrality” rules some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal by the us district court for the district of columbia in early 2014 proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network some of these parties have urged the fcc to “reclassify” broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” under title ii of the communications act thus subjecting these services to traditional utilitystyle regulation the fcc has an open proceeding concerning whether and what new regulation to adopt and on what legal basis the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks including through the use of malware computer viruses dedicated denial of services attacks credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our service providers could have an adverse effect on our business cyber attacks may cause equipment failures loss of information including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations cyber attacks against companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years further the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks which individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks including protection of our systems and networks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future 

our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of cyber attacks even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources lost revenues from business interruption and litigation the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain further certain of verizon’s businesses such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack in addition if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data sensitive information about verizon and intellectual property or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks it could result in damage to our reputation which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

  

verizon’s debt has increased significantly and could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2014 verizon had approximately 1133 billion of outstanding indebtedness as well as approximately 79 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the term loan agreement verizon entered into in connection with the wireless transaction requires verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon’s credit ratings are at or above a certain level which could limit verizon’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 177300 employees and approximately 209000 retirees as of december 31 2014 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 27 of our workforce was represented by labor unions in 2015 we will be engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 39000 employees of our wireline business during the course of these negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage depending on the outcome of the negotiations we may incur additional costs in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time shareholder derivative suits patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

tableend the principal market for trading in the common stock of verizon is the new york stock exchange as of december 31 2014 there were 664218 shareowners of record 

high and low stock prices as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape of transactions and dividend data are as follows 

 

 stock repurchases 

in march 2014 the verizon board of directors authorized a threeyear share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the company’s common stock under the program shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated transactions and on the open market including through plans complying with rule 10b51c under the exchange act the timing and number of shares purchased under the program if any will depend on market conditions and the company’s corporate needs 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 verizon did not repurchase any shares of verizon common stock at december 31 2014 the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million 

in addition to the previously authorized threeyear share buyback program in february 2015 the verizon board of directors authorized verizon to enter into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement to repurchase 50 billion of the company’s common stock the total number of shares that verizon will repurchase under the asr agreement will be based generally upon the volumeweighted average share price of verizon’s common stock during the term of the transaction on february 10 2015 in exchange for an upfront payment totaling 50 billion verizon received an initial delivery of 862 million shares having a value of approximately 425 billion final settlement of the transaction under the asr agreement including delivery of the remaining shares if any that verizon is entitled to receive is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of 2015

 item 9a controls and procedures 

tableend our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded processed summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effective internal control established in internal control–integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in 2013 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2014

wireless devices 

we offer several categories of wireless devices including smartphones tablets and other internet access devices as well as basic phones 

smartphones  our device lineup includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our 4g lte andor 3g evdo highspeed data services and run on various operating platforms such as apple ios google android blackberry os and windows phone os in august 2013 we launched the new verizon edge device payment plan option which now allows customers to trade in their phone for a new phone after a minimum of thirty days subject to certain conditions 

tablets and other internet devices we offer a variety of 4g lte andor 3g evdoenabled tablets from multiple manufacturers that run primarily on either the apple ios google android or microsoft windows operating system in 2013 we launched the ellipsis 7 tablet which is available exclusively from verizon wireless the tablets we offer also permit our customers to access the internet via a wifi connection in addition we offer dedicated devices that provide a mobile wifi 4g lte andor 3g evdo connection which we refer to as jetpacks capable of connecting multiple wifi enabled devices to the internet at one time our customers can also access the internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards usb modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks with embedded 4g lte and 3g evdo mobile broadband modules offered by original equipment manufacturers oems during 2013 we continued to experience strong subscriber demand for tablets and other internet devices and the percentage of our retail postpaid connection base represented by connections to these devices continued to increase 

basic phones  most of the basic phones we offer are 3g evdoenabled and have htmlbrowsing capability 

we purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers with the substantial majority of our purchases made from apple motorola mobility samsung lg electronics blackberry htc hitachi and quality one wireless through which we purchase pantech devices and accessories 

a key component of all wireless devices is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the device the lte chipsets used in our 4g lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own 4g lte chipset technology for the manufacture and supply of our cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets most of our wireless device suppliers rely on qualcomm incorporated qualcomm we also sell phones that include cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets manufactured by via telecom under license from qualcomm in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

strategic initiatives 

we have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices data services and applications available to run on our networks including the following 

 

  

  

 network 

we have the largest 4g lte and 3g evdo networks of any service provider in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of january 21 2014 our 4g lte network covers approximately 305 million people in the us including those in areas served by our lte in rural america program 

we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and that maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to expand and upgrade our network primarily to increase capacity as well as explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

  

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available we also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the united states certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g code division multiple access cdma 4g lte provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3g technologies we continue working to expand 4g lte coverage beyond our network footprint through our lte in rural america program we currently have 20 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4g lte coverage to approximately three million people under the program and to date sixteen participants have commenced operations on such networks 

in 2012 we began testing our mobile voice over internet protocol voip network known as voice over lte volte this technology which is expected to be used in addition to the current voice technology is anticipated to launch commercially in 2014 

our 3g cdma network is based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma1xrtt technology is deployed in nearly all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network in addition evdo a 3g packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a network’s vulnerability consequently we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone multiprotocol label switching network in all critical locations 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as personal communication services pcs spectrum and the 1700 and 2100 mhz band also known as advanced wireless services aws spectrum in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the united states in addition we hold licenses for portions of the 700 mhz upper c band including ten licenses that can together be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire united states and the gulf of mexico 

since 2012 we have entered into several spectrum transactions including 

 

  

  

  

   

 we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when offered by the fcc in future spectrum auctions although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future fcc spectrum auctions are uncertain at this time the fcc and the current presidential administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum the fcc is expected to conduct an auction for aws3 spectrum in late 2014 in addition congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction through the use of voluntary incentive auctions by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum the incentive auction related to the 600 mhz band is expected to take place in mid2015 although the specific timing of the aws3 600 mhz and other auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings 

since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others we have at times exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future in other cases verizon wireless has entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

network equipment and buildout 

alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells our primary cdma cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cdma cell site equipment and nokia siemens networks nsn and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely on alcatellucent nsn and ericsson for our switching equipment 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of sites and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals for macro sites small cells inbuilding systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline business units through verizon enterprise solutions a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon’s solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy our direct channel which includes our businesstobusiness sales operations and systems organization is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service plans 

in november 2013 we launched our first verizon destination store at mall of america in bloomington minnesota the store focuses on the mobile lifestyle and highlights the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives the store is part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide to become “smart stores” these newly redesigned locations showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones as the verizon destination store but on a smaller scale during the next few years we plan to open additional destination stores in high traffic locations across the country in addition our online store and gadgets  gear portal have also been redesigned to deliver a consistent shopping experience for customers across browsers and mobile platforms 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also utilize highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart radioshack and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services we have also entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a standalone basis or bundled with their services 

  

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att sprint corporation and tmobile usa as well as various regional wireless service providers we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels network investment the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase as smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

 we seek to compete in this area by offering our customers price plans for our services as well as equipment offers that they will regard as the best available value for the price 

 

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

  

 background 

our wireline segment provides voice data and video communications products and enhanced services including broadband video and data corporate networking solutions data center and cloud services security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services we provide these products and services to consumers in the united states as well as to carriers businesses and government customers both in the united states and in over 150 other countries around the world in 2013 wireline revenues were 392 billion representing approximately 33 of verizon’s aggregate revenues 

wireline service and product offerings

global wholesale provides the following services which it jointly markets with verizon’s other business units through verizon enterprise solutions 

 

 new ethernet connectivity in the united states represents the largest data growth opportunity in wholesale as we pursue our technology upgrade initiative and customers look to the future and higher capacity demands these customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing to ethernet which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones mobile broadband and mobile video global wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 4g and 3g networks 

data services also include certain valueadded business services which leverage many of the same offerings available in the global enterprise portfolio including 

 

  

  

 other 

other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former mci mass market customers and operator services in 2013 other revenues were 05 billion representing approximately 1 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

strategic initiatives 

technology developments interconnected markets shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for verizon our vision is to be a globallyconnected solutions company our market solutions are designed to deliver bestinclass products and services strengthen our competitive advantage in the marketplace and drive a highquality experience for our customers to take advantage of these market trends we have undertaken several strategic initiatives to further develop innovative products and services and enhance our market agility in the following areas of focus 

 

  

  

 our cloud infrastructure also enables realtime analytical capabilities for our m2m customers providing an endtoend capability where customers can store process and analyze large amounts of data on a realtime basis our cloud infrastructure also has the ability to handle multiple instances of an application providing global support and availability of the applications without increased latency the integration of our cloud infrastructure with our telematics assets provides our customers with new and innovative service capabilities that are scalable and which we believe are operationally superior to other bifurcated approaches 

  

  

 in addition to these strategic areas of focus we are investing in verizon labs and the software center of excellence to support software development and architecture as well as development stage products and services we believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative nextgeneration products and services to market and uncover new sources of revenue increase revenue of existing projects and leverage our strengths across the company 

network 

to provide services to our customers we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the united states and around the world 

 

 the passive optical network technology upon which the fios network is deployed positions verizon to meet growing bandwidth requirements our network architecture provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development for example new optical terminals can be added to the fibertothepremise network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction select field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second gbps and when a more advanced nextgeneration technology has been connected to the fiberoptic network connection speeds of 10 gbps have been reached demonstrating the significant growth capacity built into the fios platform 

additionally this advanced optical network is also finding increased application opportunities in the business sector especially as the industry seeks to migrate to ethernetbased access services 

 

 global ip traffic has increased substantially over the last five years and is expected to continue to grow significantly this global business is also rapidly evolving to an “everythingasaservice” model in which business customers seek cloudbased converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services with the continued deployment of its packet optical transport strategy verizon is creating a single highcapacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology the result is a global ip network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands 

although overall wireline capital expenditures declined in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of decreased legacy spending requirements and a decline in spending on our fios network we furthered our global ip network expansion initiatives into europe asia africa and south america as well as the continued deployment of the industry’s first commercial 100g gbps technology on us and european backbone routes more than 13000 100g ultralonghaul route miles were added to the global ip network in 2013 and we plan to further extend our 100g technology in 2014 

we believe that our continued focus on advancing our fiberbased networks and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments will help verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers 

  

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

 in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in addition wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2013 verizon annual report to shareowners 

in the global enterprise market the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

  

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our products and services the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges we could experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment and handsets that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings without relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal state and local or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc andor various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services as another example we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with socalled “open access” fcc regulations which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice in addition our broadband internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose socalled “network neutrality” rules some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal in early 2014 proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network the further regulation of broadband wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks 

cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology it security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers in addition the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain cyber attacks which include the use of malware computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access on companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cyber security measures lost revenues from business interruption and litigation further certain of verizon’s businesses including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack in addition if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data sensitive information about verizon and intellectual property or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security it could result in damage to our reputation which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

verizon’s debt has increased significantly and could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2013 verizon had approximately 936 billion of outstanding indebtedness as well as approximately 61 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility since that date verizon has incurred 203 billion of additional indebtedness and became entitled to draw upon an additional 2 billion of borrowing capacity under a 364day revolving credit agreement verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition the term loan agreement verizon entered into in connection with the wireless transaction requires verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon’s credit ratings are at or above a certain level which could limit verizon’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could also affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 176800 employees and approximately 209000 retirees as of december 31 2013 eligible to participate in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 28 of our workforce was represented by labor unions we are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 2900 employees of our wireline business and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future depending on the outcome of these negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience lengthy work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 

sales of shares of verizon common stock after the completion of the wireless transaction may cause the market price of verizon common stock to fall 

as of december 31 2013 verizon had approximately 286 billion shares of common stock outstanding verizon issued approximately 127 billion shares of verizon common stock in connection with the wireless transaction the issuance of these new shares of verizon common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for verizon common stock 

in addition many vodafone shareholders are already shareholders of verizon and those shareholders may decide not to hold the additional verizon shares they received in the wireless transaction other vodafone shareholders such as funds with geographic limitations on their permitted investments may be required to sell the shares of verizon common stock that they received in the wireless transaction such sales of verizon common stock could also have the effect of depressing the market price for verizon common stock

basic phones  some of our basic phones are 3g evdoenabled and have htmlbrowsing capability we also offer a selection of basic phones that operate via our cdma1xrtt service 

we purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers with the substantial majority of our purchases made from apple motorola mobility samsung lg electronics rim and pcd through which we purchase pantech and htc devices and accessories 

a key component of all wireless devices is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the device most of our wireless device suppliers rely on qualcomm incorporated qualcomm for manufacturing and supplying cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets we also sell phones that include cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets manufactured by via telecom under license from qualcomm the lte chipsets used in our 4g lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own 4g lte chipset technology in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

strategic initiatives 

we have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices data services and applications available to run on our networks including the following 

 

  

  

 network 

we have the largest 3g evdo and 4g lte networks of any service provider in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous us metropolitan areas covering a population of approximately 298 million as of december 31 2012 

  

we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services we design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and that maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to build out expand and upgrade our network as well as explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

in addition to our own network coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g cdma 4g lte provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to those offered by 3g technologies we expect to continue to deploy 4g lte during 2013 and by yearend cover nearly our entire existing 3g network footprint we also are working to expand 4g lte coverage beyond our network footprint through our lte in rural america program under this program we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4g lte equipment and 700 mhz cblock spectrum we currently have 20 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4g lte coverage to more than two million people under the program and to date seven participants have commenced operations on such networks 

in 2012 we began testing our mobile voip voice over internet protocol network known as voice over lte volte this technology which is expected to be used in addition to the current voice technology is anticipated to result in high quality of voice service as a result of our 4g lte network we expect to launch volte for commercial use by early 2014 

our 3g cdma network is based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma1xrtt technology is deployed in nearly all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network in addition evdo a 3g packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a network’s vulnerability consequently we have battery backup at every switch and every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone multiprotocol label switching network in all critical locations 

in september 2011 verizon wireless implemented network optimization practices designed to ensure that the overwhelming majority of our data customers are not negatively impacted by the unusually high data consumption of a few data users under these current practices the top five percent of our 3g smartphone data users with unlimited data plans as well as 3g data users roaming on our network may experience a reduction in average data speeds when connected to a congested cell site if a cell site is not congested a user’s connection speed will not be impacted network optimization helps to ensure high quality network performance for our entire customer base 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum the 18001900 mhz band also known as pcs spectrum and the 1700 and 2100 mhz band also known as aws spectrum in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the united states in addition we hold licenses for portions of the 700 mhz band including eight licenses that can together be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire united states 

in 2012 verizon wireless acquired advanced wireless service aws spectrum in separate transactions with spectrumco llc and cox tmi wireless llc for which it paid an aggregate of 39 billion at the time of the closings during 2012 verizon wireless also completed license purchase and exchange transactions with leap wireless savary island wireless which is majority owned by leap wireless and a subsidiary of tmobile as a result of these transactions verizon wireless received an aggregate 26 billion of aws and pcs licenses at fair value and transferred certain aws licenses to tmobile and a 700 megahertz mhz lower a block license to leap wireless 

on april 18 2012 we announced plans to initiate an open sale process for all of our 700 mhz lower a and b block spectrum licenses subject to the receipt of acceptable bids we acquired these licenses as part of federal communications commission fcc auction 73 in 2008 on january 25 2013 verizon wireless agreed to sell 39 lower 700 mhz b block spectrum licenses to att in exchange for a payment of 19 billion and the transfer by att to verizon wireless of aws 10 mhz licenses in certain markets in the western united states verizon wireless also agreed to sell certain lower 700 mhz b block spectrum licenses to an investment firm for a payment of 02 billion these transactions are subject to approval by the fcc and the department of justice doj when finalized the sales will result in the completion of the open sale process we expect to deploy the remaining licenses as necessary to meet our own spectrum needs 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we entered into license exchange agreements with tmobile and cricket license company llc a subsidiary of leap wireless to exchange certain aws licenses these noncash exchanges which are subject to approval by the fcc and other customary closing conditions are expected to close in 2013 the exchange includes a number of intramarket swaps that will result in more efficient use of the aws band as a result of these transactions we expect to record an immaterial gain 

we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when offered by the fcc in future spectrum auctions although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future fcc spectrum auctions are uncertain at this time the fcc and the current presidential administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum in addition congress has adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction through the use of voluntary incentive auctions by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum the timing and nature of those auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings 

as we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others we have at times exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions we expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future in other cases verizon wireless has entered into intramarket spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

network equipment and buildout 

our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cell site equipment and motorola and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely upon alcatellucent motorola and ericsson for our switching equipment alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals in some instances we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend 

marketing and distribution 

our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network jointly marketing with vodafone and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with verizon’s wireline business units through verizon enterprise solutions a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon’s solutions for medium and large business and government customers globally our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets 

we use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy our direct channel which includes our businesstobusiness operations and systems organization is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local regional and national business customers in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless phones accessories and service plans 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us we also utilize highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart radioshack and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services we have also entered into agency agreements with a number of broadband video and voice service providers through which our products and services are sold on a standalone basis or bundled with their services 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att sprint nextel corporation and tmobile usa as well as various regional wireless service providers including us cellular metro pcs and leap wireless we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase if smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers 

  

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors

network 

to provide services to our customers we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the united states and around the world 

fios our goal is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in our service areas and we believe network reliability and expanded functionality are key to achieving this goal as of december 31 2012 the fios network passed over 176 million premises verizon has extended fios to the business market as ethernet services have seen significant growth across all lines of business we leverage our fibertothepremise infrastructure to offer new services to the business community expanding our coverage and ethernet and ip wan services sought by businesses today we offer internet speeds up to 300 mbps utilizing fibertothepremise fttp access technologies over fiber optic cables our network architecture also provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development for example new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly one gigabit per second gbps downstream and upstream and when a more advanced xgpon2 technology was connected to the fiberoptic network connection speeds of 10 gbps were reached demonstrating the significant capacity built into the fios network 

global ip  verizon’s global network encompasses over 830000 route miles of terrestrial and undersea cable we have expanded our virtual private lan service to europe asiapacific and additional north american locations this long haul fiber network serves the business community to support and enable far reaching international operations we have focused on the expansion of our private ip network to serve all key international markets with quality of serviceaware ip virtual private network managed services our public ip network is now interconnected to our private ip network through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces we have installed additional private ip edge routers for a total of 1145 edge routers in 257 sites throughout 66 countries 

global ip traffic increased in recent years verizon’s key buildout efforts in 2012 included network expansion initiatives into europe asia africa and south america as well as continued deployment of the industry’s first commercial 100g gigabits per second technology on us and european backbone routes more than 12000 100g ultralonghaul route miles were added to the global ip backbone in 2012 we expect to further extend our 100g technology in 2013 from our long haul backbone into our metro networks this expansion will enable us to meet growing demand with higher access speeds and fully support increases in the use of cloud applications video distribution services and wireless technologies in the enterprise market 

  

fibertothecellsite our fttcs ethernet backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3g and 4g lte wireless data networks nationwide to support this initiative over 21000 total cell site connections have been completed since the start of this program 

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm this new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and highspeed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

to leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades we have been focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate ethernet sonet and optics and ultralonghaul technologies 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

 in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in addition wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of voip services as well as internet portal providers 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone 

  

operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2012 verizon annual report to shareowners 

in the global enterprise market the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

  

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the united states and abroad may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between wireless cable internet local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our services and equipment the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges we could lose market share and experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment handsets and other devices and equipment that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas and require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are frequently involved in regulatory and nonregulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business results of operations and financial condition 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example the development of new technologies such as ipbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology 

as the holder of 700 mhz c block licenses we are required to comply with certain “open access” regulations that the fcc has imposed on all licensees of 700 mhz c block spectrum these rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the lte network we are deploying on that spectrum including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers subject to certain technical limitations established by us in addition our broadband internet access services are subject to certain fccimposed “net neutrality” rules which took effect in november 2011 and are subject to a pending appeal these rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in the “open access” and “net neutrality” rules are not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities which could lead to yet further regulation the regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks 

cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology it security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers in addition the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain cyber attacks which include the use of malware computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access on companies including verizon have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years while to date we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operations or financial condition the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cyber security measures lost revenues from business interruption litigation and damage to our reputation further certain of verizon’s businesses including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack in addition if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data sensitive information about the company and intellectual property or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security it could result in damage to our reputation which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations 

our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters power outages terrorist attacks other hostile acts and events beyond our control such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations in addition these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 183400 employees and approximately 205600 retirees as of december 31 2012 participating in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 29 of our workforce was represented by labor unions we are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 4800 wireline employees and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future depending on the outcome of these negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience lengthy work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

 network 

our network is among the largest in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous us metropolitan areas our network covered a population of approximately 296 million as of december 31 2011 

our goal is to provide the highest network reliability for the provision of data and voice services we design and deploy our data network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions and completions of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds and we design and deploy our voice network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls by our customers that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped we plan to continue to build out expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

technology 

our primary network technology platforms are 4g lte and 3g cdma 4g lte provides higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for data services than 3g technologies we launched our 4g lte network in december 2010 and by january 19 2012 it was deployed in 195 markets covering more than 200 million people by mid2013 we expect that our 4g lte network will have been deployed in virtually our entire 3g cdma network footprint we also plan to expand our 4g lte coverage beyond our existing 3g cdma footprint through our lte in rural america program under this program we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4g lte network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4g lte equipment and 700 mhz spectrum we currently have 15 committed program participants that have the potential to provide 4g lte coverage to more than two million people outside of our 4g lte footprint 

while competing wireless service providers are also migrating to lte technology we believe that we have a timetomarket and coverage advantage over these providers 

our 3g cdma network is based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma1xrtt technology is deployed in virtually all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network in addition evdo a 3g packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our 3g cdma network 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a network’s vulnerability consequently we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location in addition we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed to cell sites if needed we further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant backbone multiprotocol label switching network in all critical locations 

in september 2011 verizon wireless implemented network optimization practices designed to ensure that the overwhelming majority of our data customers are not negatively impacted by the unusually high data consumption of a few data users under these current practices the top five percent of our 3g smartphone data users with unlimited data plans as well as 3g data users roaming on our network may experience a reduction in average data speeds when connected to a congested cell site if a cell site is not congested a user’s connection speed will not be impacted network optimization helps to ensure high quality network performance for our entire customer base 

spectrum 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services we have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum andor 18001900 mhz band also known as pcs spectrum in areas where virtually all of the population of the united states resides in parts of the united states we also have licenses for advanced wireless services aws spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in addition we hold licenses for portions of the 700 mhz band including eight licenses that can together be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire united states we plan on using both our 700 mhz and aws spectrum to provide advanced broadband services and in late 2010 we began using certain of our 700 mhz licenses for that purpose in connection with the launch of our 4g lte network 

in addition to our licensed coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in virtually all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

we anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand this increasing demand is being driven by growth in customer connections and usage of wireless broadband services which use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed to stay competitive we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the federal communications commission fcc if and when offered by the fcc in future spectrum auctions although the availability of new spectrum for 

  

commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future fcc spectrum auctions are unknown at this time the fcc and the current presidential administration have been seeking the release of additional mobile use spectrum in addition congress has recently adopted legislation that provides for the establishment of a national public safety network and the reallocation and auction through the use of voluntary incentive auctions by 2022 of portions of the existing broadcast spectrum the timing and nature of those auctions will be determined by future regulatory proceedings we have entered into agreements to acquire aws spectrum licenses held by spectrumco llc and cox tmi wireless during 2011 we also entered into agreements with a subsidiary of leap wireless and with savary island wireless which is majorityowned by leap wireless for the purchase of certain of their aws and pcs licenses in exchange for cash and our 700 mhz a block license in chicago the consummation of each of these transactions is subject to customary closing conditions including approval by the fcc 

as we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others we have at times arranged spectrum swaps and we expect to have opportunities to benefit from spectrum license trades in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future these swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

network equipment and buildout 

our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cell site equipment and motorola and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely upon alcatellucent motorola and ericsson for our switching equipment alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals in some instances we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend 

marketing 

we focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market groups promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network jointly marketing with vodafone and jointly marketing to enterprise customers with verizon’s wireline business units through verizon enterprise solutions a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of verizon’s solutions for business and government customers globally our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to present our marketing message consistently across all of our markets our sales strategy is to use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs we rely on thirdparty providers for device warehousing and distribution 

companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy our direct channel which includes our businesstobusiness operations and systems organization is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local regional and national business customers we also have a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our largest corporate customers and our federal and other large government accounts in addition we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless phones accessories and service plans 

our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet the majority of these agents sell our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us in addition we utilize highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart radioshack and target to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services stores such as dollar general big lots and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services 

in december 2011 we entered into commercial agreements with affiliates of comcast corporation time warner cable bright house networks and cox communications inc the cable companies through these agreements the cable companies and verizon wireless became agents to sell one another’s products and services and over time the cable companies will have the option subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements to sell verizon wireless service on a wholesale basis these agreements are currently under review by the department of justice 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we compete against other national wireless service providers including att sprint nextel corporation and tmobile usa as well as various regional wireless service providers including us cellular metro pcs and leap wireless we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase if smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers 

  

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services for example microsoft google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

  

 background 

the wireline segment provides customers with voice service including long distance broadband video and data ip network services network access and other services we provide these products and services to consumers and small businesses in the united states as well as to businesses and government customers and carriers both in the united states and in over 150 other countries around the world in 2011 wireline revenues were 407 billion representing approximately 37 of verizon’s aggregate revenues 

wireline service and product offerings 

we organize our service and product offerings by the primary market targeted by these offerings – mass markets global enterprise global wholesale and other 

during 2011 we enhanced our offerings of cloud services by acquiring terremark worldwide inc terremark a global provider of information technology infrastructure and cloud services and by acquiring a provider of cloud software technology these acquisitions improved verizon’s competitive position in the managed hosting and cloud services space enhanced our offerings to business and government customers globally and contributed to our growth in revenues 

mass markets 

mass markets operations provide local exchange basic service and enduser access and long distance including regional toll voice services broadband services including highspeed internet and fios internet and fios video services to residential and small business subscribers in 2011 mass markets revenues were 163 billion representing approximately 40 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

video services we offer video service over our fiberoptic network as of december 31 2011 fios video is available to approximately 13 million homes across 12 states as well as the district of columbia we believe fios video has features that differentiate it from the competition including its channel lineup interactive media guide home media dvr and breadth of high definition content as well as the following 

 

  

  

 in february 2012 a new joint venture between verizon and coinstar inc was announced at the outset verizon will hold a 65 majority ownership share and redbox automated retail llc a subsidiary of coinstar inc will hold a 35 ownership share the joint venture will be consolidated by verizon for reporting purposes the joint venture will offer access to physical media rentals through redbox kiosks and online and mobile content streaming from verizon to consumers across the country the joint venture plans to introduce its product portfolio which will include subscription services in mid2012 the initial funding related to the formation of the joint venture is not significant to verizon 

data services we offer highspeed internet and fios broadband data products with varying downstream and upstream processing speeds our customers can order fios internet with speeds of up to 150 mbps downstream and 35 mbps upstream which is currently the fastest massmarket broadband service in the united states 

  

voice services we offer voice services that include local exchange regional long distance wire maintenance and voice messaging services as well as voip services which use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications we also offer plans that include landline and wireless services with calling features and unlimited calling between a verizon customer’s home phone and wireless handset all on a single bill 

global enterprise 

global enterprise offers strategic services including networking products and solutions advanced communications services and other core communications services to medium and large business customers multinational corporations and state and federal government customers global enterprise jointly markets these services with verizon’s other business units through verizon enterprise solutions in 2011 global enterprise revenues were 156 billion representing approximately 38 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

strategic services strategic services consist of networking products and solutions which are primarily private internet protocol ip services and advanced communication services which are primarily security infrastructure and cloud services 

networking products and solutions primarily include 

 

  

 advanced communication services primarily include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 other services  other services include core voice and data services which consist of a comprehensive portfolio of global solutions utilizing traditional telecommunications’ technology such as conferencing and contact center solutions as well as private line and data access networks frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode atm services core services also include providing customer premise equipment installation maintenance and site services 

we are currently conducting an assessment and enhancement project of our global enterprise operating model to allow us to continue to be competitive in the information and communication technology market the goal of this project is to improve the customer experience our geographic balance and the global consistency of our operations and to transform our business models and our talent in order to further grow our revenues and our business 

  

global wholesale 

global wholesale provides communications services including data voice and local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local long distance and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers in 2011 global wholesale revenues were 80 billion representing approximately 20 of wireline’s aggregate revenues a portion of global wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies most of who compete directly with us 

global wholesale provides the following services which it jointly markets with verizon’s other business units through verizon enterprise solutions 

 

 our wireless customers in the united states represent the largest growth opportunity in wholesale as we build backhaul connections from their cell sites to mobile switching centers these customers are also migrating networks from time division multiplexing tdm to ethernet which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones mobile broadband and mobile video global wholesale offers a complete suite of services to support the expansion of 3g networks and the rollout of 4g networks 

data services also includes certain valueadded business services which leverage many of the same offerings available in the global enterprise portfolio including 

 

  

  

  

  

 other 

other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former mci mass market customers operator services card services and supply sales as well as dial around services including 1010987 1010220 and prepaid cards in 2011 other revenues were 08 billion representing approximately 2 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

network 

in order to provide services to our customers we operate an advanced telecommunications network in the united states and around the world 

fios  we are well on the way toward our goal of being the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in our service areas and we know network reliability and expanded functionality are key to achieving that objective we offer america’s fastest internet with speeds up to 150mbps utilizing fibertothepremise fttp access technologies over fiber optic cables our network architecture also provides the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development for example new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction field trials have successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly 1 gigabit per second gbps downstream and upstream and when a more advanced xgpon2 technology was connected to the fiberoptic network connection speeds of 10 gbps were reached demonstrating the significant capacity built into the fios network 

the verizon fios network now carries 130 high definition television channels over 30 thousand videoondemand titles 3800 high definition titles and continues groundbreaking advances in 3d technology espn 3d was the first 247 3d channel and verizon recently took another first step in 3d programming with the first televised live 3d college football game new fios service offerings also continue to eliminate the barrier between “home” and “away” the introduction of the my fios mobile application provides verizon fios customers onthego access to entertainment personal content tv controls home monitoring customer service tools and more examples of how verizon customers can use 

  

my fios include viewing a live camera feed when away from home using our new home monitoring and control service selecting from the latest movies available on flex view and for viewing on a laptop or other mobile device remotely scheduling a dvr to record a favorite tv show or sharing photos and videos using media manager 

global ip  we have expanded our virtual private lan service to europe asiapacific and additional north american locations we have focused on the expansion of our private ip network to serve all key international markets with quality of serviceaware ip virtual private network managed services our public ip network is now interconnected to our private ip network through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces we have installed additional private ip edge routers for a total of 988 edge routers in 251 sites throughout 66 countries we also activated most of the links in the europe india gateway system in 2011 linking countriesterritories between europe the middle east and india thereby delivering significant network capacity and diversity into emerging international markets 

we deployed the industry’s first commercial 100g gigabits per second ultralonghaul optical system for live traffic on our european optical core network in 2010 and followed that up with another industry first in 2011 with initial deployments of 100g technology on our us backbone network during 2012 approximately 7000 additional route miles of the domestic ultralonghaul backbone network will be upgraded to 100g capable systems 

fibertothecellsite  our fttcs ethernet backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3g and 4g lte wireless data networks nationwide to support this initiative over 18000 total cell site connections have been completed since the start of this program 

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm this new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and highspeed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

to leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades we have been focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate ethernet sonet and optics and ultralonghaul technologies 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in addition wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from companies that provide voip services which are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies and national and regional providers internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2011 verizon annual report to shareowners 

  

in the global enterprise business the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers and hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services in addition mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

   

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad and have significantly increased the rate of such filings each year verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial condition or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lowercost products and services offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the united states and abroad may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our services and equipment the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges we could lose market share and experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

for example we have selected long term evolution technology lte as our nextgeneration wireless network access technology our ability to continue to deploy our 4g lte network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver 4g lte network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications furthermore our deployment of 4g lte may not occur at the cost we have estimated if these risks materialize our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services if we are unable to do so on a costeffective basis we could experience reduced profits 

  

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment handsets and other devices and equipment that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas and require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are frequently involved in regulatory and nonregulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business results of operations and financial condition 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example the development of new technologies such as ipbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology 

as the holder of 700 mhz c block licenses we are required to comply with certain “open access” regulations that the fcc has imposed on all licensees of 700 mhz c block spectrum these rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the lte network we are deploying on that spectrum including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers subject to certain technical limitations established by us in addition on december 21 2010 the fcc adopted an order in which it imposed socalled “net neutrality” rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet these new rules which took effect in november 2011 and are subject to a pending appeal will limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in the “open access” and “net neutrality” rules are not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities which could lead to yet further regulation the regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks 

  

breaches of network or information technology security natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business 

cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology it security natural disasters terrorist acts or acts of war may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers in particular both unsuccessful and successful cyber attacks on companies have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent years the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business increased expenditures on cyber security measures lost revenues from business interruption litigation and damage to our reputation further certain of verizon’s businesses including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack in addition if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data sensitive information about the company and intellectual property or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security it could result in damage to our reputation which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 193900 employees and approximately 209400 retirees as of december 31 2011 participating in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 30 of our workforce was represented by labor unions labor contracts covering many of our union employees expired on august 6 2011 at which time verizon experienced a 14day work stoppage the company and the unions then entered into a return to work agreement pursuant to which the employees returned to work under the terms and conditions of the previous contracts indefinitely however either the company or the unions may terminate the contract extensions after providing seven 7 days notice we continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts depending on the course of these negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience additional work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including through a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

data services 

as wireless service providers continue to upgrade their networks to enhance datacarrying capabilities and to permit higherspeed data transmission the demand for full internet browsing capabilities for phones and the proliferation of wireless data applications for wirelessenabled laptops phones and other wireless devices is increasing and driving wireless data usage this growing demand for wireless data services has in turn spurred the demand for stillhigherspeed network technologies and the development of an array of more advanced wireless devices that include more robust data functionality our 4g lte network which we began deploying in 2010 provides us with higher data throughput performance and improved network efficiencies compared to those offered by 3g technologies during the first half of 2011 we expect to begin offering an array of 4genabled devices including smartphones tablets a netbook a notebook computer and mobile hotspot devices 

we offer a wide variety of data services and applications such as

wireless devices 

we believe that our position in the us wireless industry has enabled us to become a wireless service provider of choice for wireless device manufacturers and has helped position us as the launch partner for new and innovative device offers for our customers and branded phones that complement our focus on highquality service and an optimal user experience 

we offer several categories of wireless devices including smartphones and feature phones as well as internet access devices such as computers tablets mobile hotspot devices and usb modems the majority of the phones we offer are evdo enabled and all of these phones are compliant with the fcc’s enhanced 911 requirements we also offer a number of devices that in addition to working on our evdo network enable our customers to access gsm global system for mobile communications networks when traveling abroad 

smartphones  our device lineup includes an array of smartphones that are enabled to utilize our evdo revision a highspeed data service and have highlevel operating platforms such as android ios 4 blackberry os webos and windows mobile we offer smartphones from motorola apple rim htc lg palm and samsung in addition during the first half of 2011 we expect to offer smartphones that can operate on our 4g lte network 

feature phones  some of our feature phones are evdoenabled and have htmlbrowsing capability many of our feature phones can access services such as v cast and vz navigator as well as mobile web which enables our customers to access the internet on their phones through our customized web portal certain of these phones have other enhanced features such as qwerty keyboards and touch screens additionally we offer a selection of feature phones that operate via our cdma1xrtt service some of our feature phones are ruggedized and support our push to talk service

device suppliers 

we purchase wireless devices and accessories from a number of manufacturers with the substantial majority of our purchases made from lg electronics apple samsung motorola rim palm and pcd through which we purchase pantech and htc devices and accessories 

a key component of all wireless phones is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the phone most of our smartphone and feature phone suppliers rely on qualcomm incorporated qualcomm for manufacturing and supplying cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets we also sell phones that include cdma1xrtt chipsets manufactured by via telecom under license from qualcomm the lte chipsets used in our lteenabled devices are manufactured by various companies each using its own lte chipset 

  

technology in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly 

application and device development 

we have undertaken several initiatives to develop innovative devices data services and applications available to run on our 3g andor 4g lte networks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 networ k 

our network is among the largest in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous us metropolitan areas our network covers a population of approximately 292 million and provides service to our customer base of approximately 941 million as of december 31 2010 

our goal is to provide the highest network reliability we focus our efforts on designing and deploying our network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls by our customers that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped thirdparty studies conducted in the fourth quarter of 2010 show that on a percentage basis we have the fewest dropped calls and the fewest ineffective attempts among the national wireless service providers in the 98 most populous us metropolitan areas we plan to continue to build out expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

technology 

our primary network technology platform is cdma based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma1xrtt technology is deployed in virtually all of the cell sites in our cdma network in addition evdo a 3g packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in substantially all of the cell sites in our cdma network we also provide gsm service and fulfill gsm roaming obligations in certain markets as a result of our purchase of rural cellular and alltel as well as certain markets from att that it had previously acquired from centennial communications 

competing wireless service providers have chosen gsmhspa high speed packet data or other technologies as the technology platforms for their 3g networks while we believe our 3g cdma technology offers many advantages compared to gsmhspa such as more efficient spectrum usage and lower overall operating costs gsmhspa substantially leads in worldwide market share affording its users certain scale advantages 

  

in 2010 we launched our 4g lte network in 38 major metropolitan areas and more than 60 commercial airports in the united states and we expect to deploy lte in an additional 140 markets by the end of 2011 and in virtually our entire current 3g network footprint by the end of 2013 this new technology follows gsm’s evolutionary path but is different from and is an improvement upon the previous generations of both gsmhspa and cdmabased digital radio technologies lte networks are designed to provide higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for 4g lte wireless voice and data services many other major wireless service providers both domestic and foreign have also selected lte as the technology for their 4g lte deployments we believe that lte will provide us with a 4g technology with global scale 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service power and backhaul transport facilities can often become a network’s vulnerability consequently we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location we further enhance reliability by providing secondary transport facilities for critical links in the network 

spectrum and network coverage 

the spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services including text and multimedia messaging location based services machinetomachine services and broadband internet access we have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz band also known as cellular spectrum andor 18001900 mhz band also known as pcs spectrum in areas where virtually all of the population of united states reside in parts of the united states we also have licenses for advanced wireless services aws spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands in addition we hold licenses for portions of the 700 mhz band including eight licenses that can be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire united states we plan on using both our 700 mhz and aws spectrum to provide advance broadband services and in december 2010 we began using certain of our 700 mhz licenses for that purpose in connection with the launch of our 4g lte network 

in addition to our licensed coverage we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in virtually all other areas in the united states where wireless service is available certain of our roaming agreements are terminable at will by either party upon several months’ notice however we do not believe that the termination of any of these atwill agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business 

we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum in a limited number of our markets to meet future demand we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc if and when offered by the fcc in future spectrum auctions although the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future fcc spectrum auctions are unknown at this time the fcc and the obama administration have been seeking the release of an additional 300 mhz of mobile use spectrum by 2015 and a further 200 mhz by 2020 as we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others we have at times arranged spectrum swaps and we expect to have opportunities to use the beneficial trading of spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

network equipment and buildout 

our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cell site equipment and motorola and ericsson which together provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment we also rely upon alcatellucent motorola and ericsson for our switching equipment alcatellucent and ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our lte network deployments 

as we continue to build and upgrade our existing network we must complete a variety of steps including securing rights to a large number of cell site and switch site locations and obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals in some instances we have encountered difficulty in obtaining the necessary site leases at commercially reasonable rates and the zoning approvals needed to construct new towers we utilize tower site management firms such as crown castle international corp and american tower corporation as lessors or managers of our existing tower sites upon which our operations depend 

marketing 

we focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market segments such as young adults seniors families small to large businesses global enterprises and the federal government promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and crossmarketing with verizon’s other business units and vodafone 

our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions designed to consistently present our marketing message across all of our markets our promotion of the verizon wireless brand is complemented by our marketing of the verizon brand reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of our global enterprise and consumer wireline base 

  

sales and distribution channels 

our sales strategy is to use a combination of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs we rely on thirdparty providers for device warehousing and distribution 

direct 

companyoperated stores  companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy we operate stores and kiosks throughout the united states including storewithinastore kiosks in many bj’s wholesale and pc richard and son locations 

businesstobusiness  our direct channel also includes our businesstobusiness operations and systems organization which is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local regional and national business customers 

enterprise and government  we have a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our largest corporate customers and our federal and other large government accounts this organization is focused on delivering to these customers integrated industryspecific solutions to meet their telecommunications needs 

telemarketing and webbased  we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers and we offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless phones accessories and service plans 

indirect 

our agents sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the united states as well as through the internet 

local agents  we have local agents strategically placed within our markets in many cases in communities that are not in close proximity to one of our companyoperated store locations the majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us 

national retailers highprofile national retailers such as best buy walmart and target sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services our customers can also purchase the iphone 4 at apple stores throughout the united states in addition stores such as dollar general big lots and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services these and other national retailers constitute a significant portion of our indirect sales channel our ability to attract new subscribers and our revenue could be adversely affected if our relationship with any of our national indirect distributors were terminated or if they shifted the mix of their business to favor other wireless service providers 

oems  our distribution network has been further expanded by forming relationships with oems in the computer industry for example oems such as dell lenovo hewlett packard panasonic oqo and samsung are embedding evdo mobile broadband modules into certain of their notebook computer models and tablets enabling users to activate data service on our network and connect at broadband speeds to corporate networks email and the internet 

bulk sale of wireless access 

we sell wireless capacity on a bulk basis our traditional wholesale business involves the sale of voice andor data access to independent companies such as tracfone that in turn resell wireless services to their end users we had approximately 66 million of these wholesale lines as of december 31 2010 we also sell wireless capacity to support telemetry and telematics services as described above 

customer service retention and satisfaction 

we believe that quality customer service is a key differentiator in the wireless industry because it increases customer satisfaction which reduces the rate at which our customers disconnect individual lines of service churn therefore satisfying and retaining existing customers is critical to the financial performance of wireless service providers and an essential element of our strategy our customer service retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easytouse products and services in order to promote longterm relationships and minimize churn 

we have customer service representatives available 24 hours a day seven days a week to assist with technical customer issues as well as dedicated customer service teams to address the specialized needs of our business customers customers can also conduct business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced selfserve applications which allow them to access their account information make payments and make changes to their accounts these applications include our interactive voice response system our web site and applications accessible from a customer’s phone 

we have undertaken a variety of customer retention initiatives including providing customers with the option to change their service plan at any time to any qualifying wireless service plan without paying any additional fees or requiring any contract extension instituting an early termination fee that decreases after each full month that a customer remains on their contract and providing customers with the ability to upgrade their phone prior to the end of their contract term at promotional pricing provided that the customer signs a new qualifying service contract we also contact customers at key times during the customer relationship about targeted offers and to provide proactive service plan analysis 

  

competition 

we compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers att sprint nextel corporation and tmobile usa in addition in many markets we also compete with regional wireless service providers such as us cellular metro pcs and leap wireless we also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale including those that buy from us we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase if smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services for example skype as well as google apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

  

 background 

the wireline segment provides customers with communications products and services that include voice internet access broadband video and data ip network services network access long distance and other services we provide these products and services to consumers in the united states as well as to businesses government customers and carriers both in the united states and in over 150 other countries around the world in 2010 wireline revenues were 412 billion representing approximately 39 of verizon’s aggregate revenues 

wireline service and product offerings 

we organize our service and product offerings by the primary market targeted by these offerings – mass markets global enterprise global wholesale and other 

in july 2010 the company spun off a subsidiary of verizon spinco to its stockholders which held defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of the company in predominantly rural areas in 14 states immediately following the spinoff spinco merged with frontier communications corporation frontier pursuant to a definitive agreement with frontier this transaction further focused the company’s mass markets asset base around its fastest growing business – fios fiberoptic services 

mass markets 

mass markets operations provide local exchange basic service and enduser access long distance including regional toll broadband services including highspeed internet and fios internet and fios tv services to residential and small business subscribers in partnership with directv verizon also offers satellite television service to enable double and tripleplay offers in nonfios markets in 2010 mass markets revenue were 163 billion representing approximately 40 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

our goal is to be the customer’s first choice for communications and entertainment services to achieve this we offer a variety of services at different price points

our strategic services include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2010 we began a multiyear reorganization of our global enterprise operating model to allow us to continue to be competitive in the information and communication technology market the goal of this project is to improve the customer experience our geographic balance and the global consistency of our operations and to transform our business models and our talent in order to further grow our revenues and our business 

  

global wholesale 

global wholesale offers switched access and special access services primarily to long distance and other carriers who use our facilities to provide services to their customers a portion of global wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies many of whom compete directly with us in 2010 global wholesale revenues were 84 billion representing approximately 20 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

we offer a comprehensive portfolio of voice data valueadded business and local telecommunications services to a wide array of customers including interexchange carriers resellers cable service operators internet service providers network and systems integrators and content data network providers these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 other 

other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services derived from former mci mass market customers operator services pay phone card services and supply sales as well as dial around services including 1010987 1010220 1800collect and prepaid cards in 2010 other revenues were 09 billion representing approximately 2 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

network 

in order to provide services to our mass markets global enterprise and global wholesale customers we operate advanced telecommunications networks in the united states and around the world 

our goal is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market network reliability and functionality are key to achieving that goal our deployment of fibertothepremise fttp access technologies over fiber optic cables provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise based on current technology and allows us the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development for example new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction verizon’s recent launch of 15035 mbps internet service delivers the fastest massmarket broadband service in the united states over our fios network our new internet service offers three times the downstream speed previously available to fios customers recent field trials successfully achieved connection speeds of nearly 1 gigabit per second gbps downstream and upstream and when a more advanced xgpon2 technology was connected to the network connection speeds of 10 gbps were reached on the fiberoptic network demonstrating the significant headroom built into the fios network 

  

the fttp network is also supporting the introduction of flexview giving fios tv customers the ability to take video programming outside of the home and view it on a computer tablet netbook or compatible mobile phone fios also supports 3d programming including several feature films and the first televised national football league and major league baseball games in 3d other emerging applications that will be supported by our expanded network capacity include high definition video sharing video telephony telemedicine and offsite backups and storage services 

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm this new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

to leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network that can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades we have been focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we also continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies to lower overall cost as we integrate ethernet sonet and optics and ultralonghaul technologies 

we have expanded our virtual private lan service to europe asiapacific and additional north american locations we have focused on the expansion of our private ip network to serve all key international markets with managed quality of serviceaware ip virtual private network services our public ip network is now interconnected to our private ip network through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces we have installed additional private ip edge routers for a total of 814 edge routers in 233 sites throughout 61 countries and added nineteen new converged packet architecture switches for a total of 153 cpa switches in 132 sites across 36 countries 

we deployed the industry’s first commercial 100g gigabits per second ultralonghaul optical system for live traffic on our european optical core network and successfully completed other field trials of 100g technology in north america and great britain in preparation for further ultralonghaul deployments we expect to activate the europe india gateway system in early 2011 linking countriesterritories between europe the middle east and india delivering significant network capacity and diversity into emerging international markets in addition we added a japan landing to the transpacific express tpe submarine cable system connecting the west coast of the united states to china korea and taiwan 

our fibertothecellsite fttcs backhaul initiative is critical to supporting the substantial growth requirements of expanding 3g and 4g lte wireless data networks nationwide to support this initiative over 8900 cell site connections were completed in 2010 totaling almost four times the sites completed in 2009 

customer service 

we are committed to providing superior customer service as a key factor in achieving customer satisfaction and retention as part of that endeavor we focus on allowing our customers to conduct business with us in the way that is most convenient for them 

increasingly our customers are choosing to do business with us online including diagnosing and fixing problems and ordering our products and services in light of this in 2010 we completed a redesign of our website to make it easier for customers to use we also deployed inhome agent to our broadband and fios tv customers this tool allows our individual and small business customers to selfdiagnose and correct issues they may encounter without having to make a call to us or schedule a technician visit 

in addition we enhanced the online experience for our business customers by providing content targeted directly to our major segments to address their particular needs as well as information about all of our core and strategic solutions 

we provide live 247 customer support on all fios sales and service issues we have also undertaken several customer service initiatives including our fios worry free guarantee for consumers and small businesses and our service level agreements for enterprise and global wholesale which guarantee our service 

  

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions 

in the mass markets business cable operators are significant competitors cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

in addition wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from companies that provide voip services voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies and national and regional providers internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2010 verizon annual report to shareowners 

in the global enterprise business the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers hardware and software providers some of the biggest companies in it services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major it outsourcers 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services additionally mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

in addition companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses a relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent global wholesale markets we compete with these full or nearfull service providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

   

 verizon owns or has licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business we actively pursue the filing and registration of patents copyrights domain names trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the united states and abroad and have significantly increased the rate of such filings each year verizon also actively grants licenses in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to other companies that enable such companies to utilize certain verizon intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services such licenses enable such third party licensees to take advantage of the results of verizon’s research and development efforts while these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to verizon we do not believe that loss of such consideration or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material effect on our results of operations 

verizon periodically receives offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents or other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers if successful could require us to pay damages or royalties or cease offering the relevant products or services

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lowercost programs offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the united states and abroad may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our services and equipment the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services demographic trends and economic conditions if we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges we could lose market share and experience reduced profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in the demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

for example we have selected long term evolution technology lte as our nextgeneration wireless network access technology we expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt lte as their nextgeneration technology and we believe that it will become the principal nextgeneration global standard there are risks however that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of lte or change their selection and adopt different nextgeneration technologies including technologies that are incompatible with ours as a result lte may not become the principal nextgeneration global standard and may not provide us with the global scale compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all in addition our ability to deploy lte on our network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver lte devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications furthermore our deployment of lte may not occur at the cost we have estimated if these risks materialize our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

  

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us directly or through other suppliers with equipment and services such as switch and network equipment handsets and other devices and equipment that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers for example our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components such as chipsets used in their devices if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are frequently involved in regulatory and nonregulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business results of operations and financial condition 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example the development of new technologies such as ipbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology 

as the holder of 700 mhz c block licenses we are required to comply with certain “open access” regulations that the fcc has imposed on all licensees of 700 mhz c block spectrum these rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the lte network we are deploying on that spectrum including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers subject to certain technical limitations established by us the fcc has not yet finally determined what level of access will satisfy the “open access” requirements once finally determined these requirements may increase the costs or limit the revenuegenerating potential associated with our use of the c block in addition on december 21 2010 the fcc adopted an order in which it imposed socalled “net neutrality” rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet these new rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in this order are not fully defined and given that the order creates procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations of the order it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities which could lead to yet further regulation the regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks 

natural disasters terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters terrorist acts acts of war cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology it security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers in addition a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security could result in damage to our reputation any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could affect our access to financing 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 194400 employees and approximately 215400 retirees as of december 31 2010 participating in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010 the enactment of any similar health care reform measures at the state level increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 30 of our workforce was represented by labor unions labor contracts covering many of our employees will expire in 2011 accordingly in 2011 we will be engaged in negotiations with our labor unions regarding new contracts depending on the outcome of these negotiations we could incur additional costs andor experience lengthy work stoppages which could adversely affect our business operations including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers and we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs 

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

 item 1 business 

 

tableend  

 verizon communications inc verizon or the company is one of the world’s leading providers of communications services formerly known as bell atlantic corporation we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of delaware we began doing business as verizon communications inc on june 30 2000 following our merger with gte corporation we completed the acquisition of alltel corporation alltel on january 9 2009 making verizon the largest wireless service provider in the united states us in terms of the total number of customers and revenues stressing diversity and commitment to the communities in which we operate we have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 222900 employees 

our principal executive offices are located at 140 west street new york new york 10007 telephone number 2123951000 

we have two primary reportable segments domestic wireless and wireline which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services these segments and principal activities consist of the following 

 

 the following portions of the 2009 verizon annual report to shareowners are incorporated into this report 

 

  

  

  

 background 

our domestic wireless segment cellco partnership doing business as verizon wireless verizon wireless is a joint venture formed in april 2000 by the combination of the us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 in 2009 domestic wireless revenues were 62131 million representing approximately 58 of verizon’s aggregate revenues domestic wireless is not dependent on any single customer 

alltel acquisition and integration 

on june 5 2008 verizon wireless entered into an agreement and plan of merger with alltel a provider of wireless voice and data services to consumer and business customers in 34 states and its controlling stockholder atlantis holdings llc to acquire in an allcash merger 100 of the equity of alltel for cash consideration of 59 billion and the assumption of approximately 24 billion of aggregate principal amount of alltel debt verizon wireless closed the transaction on january 9 2009 see – “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent developments” in the 2009 annual report to shareowners 

as a condition of the regulatory approvals from the department of justice doj and the federal communications commission fcc that were required to complete the alltel acquisition verizon wireless is required to divest overlapping wireless properties in 105 operating markets in 24 states alltel divestiture markets these markets consist primarily of alltel operations but also include a small number of premerger operations of verizon wireless as a result of these divestiture requirements we placed the wireless licenses and assets in the alltel divestiture markets in a management trust that will continue to operate the properties under their current brands until they are sold in may 2009 verizon wireless entered into a definitive agreement with att mobility llc att mobility a subsidiary of att inc att pursuant to which att mobility agreed to acquire 79 of the 105 alltel divestiture markets including licenses and network assets for approximately 24 billion in cash in june 2009 verizon wireless entered into an agreement with atlantic telenetwork inc pursuant to which it agreed to acquire the remaining 26 alltel divestiture markets that were not included in the transaction with att mobility including licenses and network assets for 200 million in cash verizon wireless expects to close both transactions during the first half of 2010 completion of each of the foregoing transactions is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals from the doj and the fcc 

substantially all of the alltel markets that are not subject to divestiture have been rebranded to “ verizon wireless ” as a result of the acquisition of alltel we have experienced cost savings from reduced roaming costs the elimination of duplicate facilities and reduced overall expenses relating to advertising overhead and headcount we also expect to experience reduced overall combined capital expenditures as a result of greater economies of scale and the redeployment of redundant network assets our network and alltel’s network both employ code division multiple access cdma technology which is facilitating the integration of alltel’s network operations with ours we cannot however ensure that we will be able to achieve all of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits discussed above 

  

operations 

verizon wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the us and has the largest third generation 3g network of any us wireless service provider verizon wireless is the industry–leading wireless service provider in the us in terms of operating income with our acquisition of alltel verizon wireless became the largest wireless service provider in the united states as measured by the total number of customers and revenues 

competition 

in the us we compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers att sprint nextel and tmobile in addition in many markets we also compete with regional wireless service providers such as us cellular metropcs and leap wireless we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes several higherspeed wireless technologies have been deployed by various wireless service providers while others are in the process of being developed to meet the growing customer appetite for wireless communications in both fixed and fully mobile environments we have deployed the largest 3g wireless network in the united states other wireless service providers are in various stages of deploying their own 3g networks and fourth generation 4g technologies are being developed and deployed in addition some municipalities and communications companies have been deploying networks of small wifi access points competition may also increase if smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers we also compete with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased wireless service providers for resale 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services other participants in the wireless value chain including data application and content providers and device manufacturers are introducing products and services directly to wireless consumers rather than through wireless service providers in order to compete more effectively for wireless data revenues also several device makers are making thirdparty applications and content available by bundling them with their products for example apple inc is packaging software applications and content with its phones and google inc google has developed an open operating system and related applications for mobile devices that has been deployed on phones that we and certain other wireless service providers currently offer in addition in january 2010 google began selling its own branded phone directly to consumers via its web store third parties such as skype are also now offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that in certain cases can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service 

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

network 

our network is among the largest in the us with licensed and operational coverage in all of the top 100 most populous us metropolitan areas our network covers a population of approximately 290 million and provides service to our customer base of nearly 912 million as of december 31 2009 

a key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability we are focused on designing and deploying our network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls that are connected and completed by our customers on the first attempt we plan to continue to build out expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

our primary network technology platform is cdma based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma1xrtt technology is deployed in virtually all of our cell sites in our cdma network in addition evdo a thirdgeneration packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in approximately 94 of the cell sites in our cdma network as of december 31 2009 additional evdo deployment is ongoing as is the integration of the alltel portion of our network we also provide gsm service and fulfill gsm roaming obligations in certain markets as a result of our purchases of rural cellular corporation and alltel 

our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service power and transport facilities can often become a network’s vulnerability consequently we have battery backup at every switch and virtually every cell site in our network we also utilize backup generators at a majority of our cell sites and at every switch location we further ensure reliability by providing secondary transport facilities for critical links in the network 

competing wireless service providers have chosen gsm or other technologies as the technology platforms for their 3g networks while we believe our 3g cdma technology offers many advantages compared to gsm such as more efficient spectrum usage and lower overall operating costs gsm substantially leads in worldwide market share affording its users certain scale advantages 

in 2009 we continued to develop our fourth generation 4g wireless broadband network using long term evolution lte technology this new technology follows gsm’s evolutionary path but is different from and is expected to be an improvement upon the previous generations of both gsm and cdmabased digital radio technologies lte networks are designed to provide higher throughput performance and improved efficiencies for 4g wireless voice and data services we plan to launch our lte network in 25 to 30 markets in 2010 and to cover virtually all of our current 3g network footprint by the end of 2013 many other major wireless service providers both domestic and foreign have also selected lte as the technology for their 4g deployments and in december 2009 one such provider teliasonera launched commercial lte service in norway and sweden we believe that lte will provide us with the opportunity to adopt an access platform with global scale 

concurrent with ongoing lte standards development we are presently conducting tests of lte technology with vendors these tests are being conducted at several locations in the united states in february 2009 we selected ericsson and alcatellucent as primary network vendors for our initial lte network deployments in the united states we continue to conduct validation testing in conjunction with initial commercial deployments we expect that technology testing and assessments will continue as the lte technology and standards are advanced 

we have also created the verizon wireless lte innovation center which we believe will serve as a catalyst for the early development of nontraditional products for use on lte networks the center will work with several of our strategic partners to help the consumer electronics industry quickly bring products to market 

open development program 

as part of our open development program intended to provide customers with the ability to use on our network devices and mobile applications that we do not sell in 2008 we published the technical interface standards that the development community is using in order to design such devices in august 2009 we published updated standards that developers will need to design such devices that can run on the lte network that we plan to launch in 25 to 30 markets in 2010 in addition we have certified three independent laboratories to perform testing of thirdparty devices to ensure that they conform to our technical interface standards in order to operate on our network 

we believe that our open development program will spur innovation expand customer choices and produce an array of new products for use on our network and as a result increase customer connections to our network since july 2008 we have certified numerous thirdparty devices to run on our network 

additionally in august 2009 we consummated the formation of a joint venture company nphase which we own equally with qualcomm incorporated qualcomm nphase is expected to facilitate our provision of machinetomachine wireless communications solutions to a variety of vertical market segments including healthcare manufacturing utilities distribution and consumer products 

  

spectrum 

we have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz andor 18001900 mhz spectrum bands in areas where approximately 99 of the estimated us population reside as of december 31 2009 we obtained our spectrum assets through fcc lotteries auctions and allotments and acquisitions from and exchanges with private parties in parts of the us we also have licenses for aws spectrum in segments of the 1700 and 2100 mhz bands 

in addition in november 2008 the fcc granted us 109 licenses for portions of the 700 mhz band for which we were the winning bidder in fcc auction 73 certain of these licenses can be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire population of the us except alaska the spectrum we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services including text and multimedia messaging location based services machinetomachine services and broadband internet access we plan to use the aws and 700 mhz spectrum mainly for advanced broadband wireless services utilizing lte technology when combined the various bands described above give us a national average spectrum depth of approximately 88 mhz as of december 31 2009 

we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum in a limited number of our markets to meet future demand we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses if and when offered by the fcc in future spectrum auctions the availability of new spectrum for commercial wireless services and the possible dates of future fcc spectrum auctions are unknown at this time as we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and have spectrum surpluses in others we have at times arranged spectrum swaps and we expect to have opportunities to use the beneficial trading of spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance 

wireless offerings 

we believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers will help us to retain our existing customers attract new customers and increase customer usage all of which will in turn drive revenue and operating income growth in january 2010 we launched a streamlined group of new voice plans including postpaid and prepaid plans with unlimited minutes and messaging which provide our customers with simplified pricing options that we believe they will find attractive as part of this launch we also introduced simplified tiered data packages of varying sizes for our postpaid plans – unlimited usage required for customers using our 3g smartphones a 25megabyte package required for users of our 3g multimedia phones and usage on a paypermegabyte basis for users of our simple feature phones both our 3g multimedia phone and simple feature phone users have the option of upgrading to a higher tier data package 

wireless services 

voice services we offer a variety of postpaid plans for voice services and features with competitive pricing approximately 90 of our customers received our voice services on a retail postpaid basis as of december 31 2009 specifically we offer nationwide calling plans for individual customers which provide a choice at varying price points of differently sized bundles of minutes of use or unlimited minutes nationwide family shareplans and nationwide small business shareplans designed for multipleline accounts and nationwide business plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1000 lines

suppliers and product supply chain 

we purchase wireless devices and accessory products from a number of manufacturers with the substantial majority of our purchases made from lg electronics samsung motorola rim palm pcd pantech htc and nokia 

a key component of all wireless phones is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the phone most of our phone suppliers rely on qualcomm for manufacturing and supplying cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets we do however sell phones that include cdma1xrtt chipsets manufactured by via telecom under license from qualcomm in addition there are a number of other components common to wireless phones provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly we depend upon a number of key suppliers and if any of them fail to fulfill their obligations to us we may not be able to provide services or maintain and upgrade our network 

we have developed relationships with new breed logistics inc and communications test design inc for our phone and other product warehousing distribution and direct customer fulfillment we do not own a significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure 

our primary cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are alcatellucent which provides more than half of our cell site equipment motorola and telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson ericsson which together currently provide nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment until november 2009 nortel provided us with the cell site equipment now provided by ericsson in january 2009 nortel and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states and canada in connection with this bankruptcy in november 2009 the nortel business unit that supplies cdma wireless infrastructure to us was sold to ericsson we also rely upon alcatellucent motorola and as a result of the abovementioned sale ericsson for substantially all of our switching equipment 

marketing 

we focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to satisfy the needs of our various customer market segments such as young adults seniors families and small to large businesses promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and crossmarketing with verizon’s other business units and vodafone 

our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions which ensures that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets our promotion of the “verizon wireless” brand is complemented by verizon’s other brand marketing activities reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of verizon communications’ customer base 

  

sales and distribution channels 

we utilize a mix of direct indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

our direct distribution channel includes our companyoperated stores a core component of our distribution strategy our experience has been that customers that we obtain through this direct channel are less likely to cancel their service than those we obtain through indirect channels as of december 31 2009 we operated approximately 2300 companyoperated stores and kiosks we will continue to evaluate all of our stores to ensure that they are optimally located in accordance with our distribution objectives as of december 31 2009 we ceased operating approximately 335 stores located in the alltel markets that we are not required to divest certain other stores may be transitioned to local agents for their marketing of our products and services 

our direct channel also includes our businesstobusiness operations and systems organization which is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local regional and national business customers as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers in october 2009 we announced the creation of a dedicated organization to more effectively serve the needs of our large multinational corporate customers and our government accounts this organization is focused on delivering to these customers integrated industryspecific solutions to meet their telecommunications needs we also offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless phones accessories and service in all of our markets 

our indirect retail channel consists of agents that sell our postpaid andor prepaid wireless products and services at their retail locations throughout the us in addition national retailers such as best buy walmart costco and target sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services we also sell wireless capacity on a wholesale basis which involves the sale of wholesale access minutes and data services to independent companies that resell wireless services to endusers our ability to attract new subscribers and our revenue could be adversely affected if our relationship with any of our national indirect distributors were terminated or if they shifted the mix of their business to favor other wireless service providers 

customer service retention and satisfaction 

we believe that high quality customer service is a key differentiator because it increases customer satisfaction and reduces customer churn the rate at which customers disconnect individual lines of service therefore satisfying and retaining existing customers is critical to the financial performance of wireless service providers and an essential element of our strategy our customer service retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easytouse products and services in order to promote longterm relationships and minimize churn thirdparty studies conducted in 2009 show that we placed highest in overall customer satisfaction among the national wireless service providers 

while our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours we also have representatives available 24hoursaday 7daysaweek to assist with emergency and technical customer issues in addition customers can do business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced selfservice applications which include our interactive voice response system through our website and via applications accessible from customer handsets 

under our enhanced worry free guarantee a national customer retention and loyalty initiative we have committed to providing our customers with an extensive and advanced network responsive customer service with endtoend resolution the option to change at any time to any qualifying wireless service plan without paying any additional fees or requiring any contract extension an early termination fee that decreases after each full month that a customer remains on their contract and a handset upgrade credit every two years provided that the customer signs a new twoyear contract for a calling plan with at least a 35 monthly access charge in addition our my verizon advantage program offers each customer who registers with our my verizon website free backup protection for the customer’s phone contact list an annual handset upgrade option for qualified customers and periodic notification if the customer exceeds his or her plan allowance another significant retention and loyalty program is the customer lifecycle management program in which we contact customers at key times during the customer relationship about targeted offers and to provide proactive rate plan analysis

on may 13 2009 we announced plans to spin off a newly formed subsidiary of verizon spinco to our stockholders spinco will hold defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of verizon in arizona idaho illinois indiana michigan nevada north carolina ohio oregon south carolina washington west virginia and wisconsin and in portions of california bordering arizona nevada and oregon including internet access and long distance services and broadband video provided to designated customers in those areas immediately following the spinoff spinco plans to merge with frontier communications corporation frontier pursuant to a definitive agreement with frontier and frontier will be the surviving corporation the transactions do not involve any assets or liabilities of verizon wireless the merger will result in frontier acquiring approximately 4 million access lines and certain related businesses from verizon which collectively generated annual revenues of approximately 4 billion for verizons wireline segment 

depending on the trading prices of frontier common stock prior to the closing of the merger verizon stockholders will collectively own between approximately 66 and 71 of frontier’s outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the merger and frontier stockholders will collectively own between approximately 29 and 34 of frontier’s outstanding equity immediately following the closing of the merger in each case before any closing adjustments the actual number of shares of common stock to be issued by frontier in the merger will be calculated based upon several factors including the average trading price of frontier common stock during a preclosing measuring period subject to a collar and other closing adjustments verizon will not own any shares of frontier after the merger 

both the spinoff and merger are expected to qualify as taxfree transactions except to the extent that cash is paid to verizon stockholders in lieu of fractional shares 

in connection with the spinoff verizon expects to receive from spinco approximately 33 billion in value through a combination of a special cash payment to verizon a reduction in verizon’s consolidated indebtedness and in certain circumstances the issuance to verizon of debt securities of spinco in the merger verizon stockholders are expected to receive approximately 53 billion of frontier common stock assuming the average trading price of frontier common stock during the preclosing measuring period is within the collar and no closing adjustments 

the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including receipt of state and federal telecommunications regulatory approvals if the conditions are satisfied we expect this transaction to close during the second quarter of 2010 

operations 

mass markets 

mass markets operations provide local exchange basic service and enduser access long distance including regional toll broadband services including highspeed internet and fios internet and fios tv services to residential and small business subscribers in partnership with directv verizon also offers satellite television service to enable double and tripleplay offers in nonfios markets in 2009 mass markets revenues were 19755 million representing approximately 43 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

to differentiate the fios platform from its competitors initiatives are under way to leverage this technology to deliver video applications “widgets” and interactivity with television including access to social networking sites and access to internet video sites 

global enterprise 

global enterprise offers voice data and internet communications services to medium and large business customers multinational corporations and state and federal government customers we offer communications and it solutions combining professional expertise with extensive ip networks to deliver communications it information security and network solutions we securely connect todays extended enterprises with their widespread customers partners suppliers and highly mobile employees—enabling them to increase productivity efficiency and the speed at which they conduct business in addition to traditional voice and data services global enterprise offers managed and advanced products and solutions through our strategic services this encompasses our focus areas of growth including ip services and valueadded solutions that make communications more secure reliable and efficient global enterprise also provides managed network services for customers that outsource all or portions of their communications and information processing operations and data services such as private ip private line frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode atm services both domestically and internationally over 80 of our frame relay customers have converted to private ip customers can now choose an ondemand consumption model for their infrastructure as a service rather than installing and configuring dedicated environments in addition global enterprise offers professional services in more than 30 countries around the world supporting a range of solutions including network services managing a move to ipbased unified communications and providing application performance support in 2009 global enterprise revenues were 14988 million representing approximately 32 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

global wholesale 

global wholesale offers switched access and special access services primarily to long distance and other carriers who use our facilities to provide services to their customers switched access revenues are generated from fixed and usagebased charges paid by carriers for access to our local network interexchange wholesale traffic sold in the united states as well as internationally destined traffic that originates in the us special access revenues are generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks global wholesale services also include local wholesale revenues from unbundled network elements and interconnection revenues from competitive local exchange carriers and wireless carriers a portion of global wholesale revenues is generated by a few large telecommunication companies many of whom compete directly with us in 2009 global wholesale revenues were 9637 million representing approximately 21 of wireline’s aggregate revenues major initiatives that are under way such as fibertothecell sites global data growth an increased focus on highyield international voice routes and the development of new segments will further differentiate global wholesale from its competitors 

as consumer demand for smartphones and bandwidth intensive applications grow wireless carriers are looking for network solutions to carry increasing volumes of traffic our service allows virtually unlimited capacity and enables wireless carriers to offer next generation applications to their customers we have constructed more than 2300 cell sites in 2009 with fiber ethernet service across most carriers and we are on track to fully support verizon wireless’ lte launch in 2010 

global wholesale will also continue to capitalize on voice traffic growth to highyield destinations where we have volume minutes going to key destinations around the globe new opportunities are being driven by machinetomachine applications managed services and digital content which provide more value to our customers and represent the largest growth opportunities global wholesale’s initiatives are focused on providing value and targeting these growth services 

other 

other services include such services as local exchange and long distance services from former mci mass market customers operator services pay phone card services and supply sales as well as dial around services including 1010987 1010220 1800collect and prepaid cards in 2009 other revenues were 1700 million representing approximately 4 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions companies with a global presence provide a threat to the wireline segment customers particularly in the global enterprise and to a lesser extent global wholesale looking for reach and access around the world can look to a handful of telecommunications and integrated service providers that operate globally these full or nearfull service providers serve as competitors in our efforts to win large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

in the global enterprise business the customer’s need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape major competitors include system integrators carriers hardware and software providers 

some of the biggest companies in it services are either making acquisitions or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending most new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing software delivery communication applications and other computing tasks via the network rather than on inhouse machines carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been the welldefended turf of the major it outsourcers 

we believe that cable operators represent a significant threat to our wireline business cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from companies that provide voice over internet protocol voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies and national and regional providers internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to competitive local exchange carriers at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2009 verizon annual report to shareowners 

global wholesale competes with traditional carriers for longhaul voice and ip services additionally mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul network providers cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity 

  

carriers continue to strategically invest capital to build their networks further into our franchise markets consolidation continues to create opportunities – it has helped to strengthen the wholesale market by decreasing the number of competitors and contributing to price stabilization the landscape for wholesale services is also constantly changing and is driving new requirements and the nature of these relationships can quickly move from a retail model to a wholesale model 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

  

 network 

our business strategy is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market network reliability is also a key component of our business strategy we are executing on this strategy by deploying fibertothepremise fttp access technologies over fiber optic cables fttp provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise based on current technology and allows us the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction as we continue to expand our deployment of the most advanced fiber optic network we are enhancing it with gigabit passive optical network gpon technology gpon technology will continue to support the services we offer today while allowing for the introduction of new services through improved downstream and upstream capacity 

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional time division multiplexing tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm in 2009 we continued to deploy reconfigurable optic add drop multiplexer roadm nodes in the transport network as a result the new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

to fully leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls multi protocol label switching technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the cost of current data and voice services and creates a network which can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades in keeping with our strategy of leading in network reliability our service infrastructure utilizes our managed quality of serviceenabled resilient ip network rather than the public internet 

we have been focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant service flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we have also focused on the expansion of the private ip network pip to serve all key international markets with managed quality of serviceaware ip virtual private network vpn services our public ip network is now interconnected to pip through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces these enhancements extend our ip services reach across the globe 

we continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies and expansion of our network to lower overall cost we are integrating ethernet sonet and optics and ultralonghaul technologies in addition we have deployed a new next generation undersea cable technology through the transpacific express tpe connecting the west coast of the us to china korea and taiwan 

  

we continue to widen and deepen our global scope and capabilities we have expanded our virtual private lan service to europe asiapacific and additional north american locations we also deployed the industry’s first commercial 100g gigabits per second ultralonghaul optical system for live traffic on our european optical core network added a japan landing to our tpe submarine cable system and installed 106 private ip edge routers for a total of 753 edge routers in 212 sites in 59 countries

 global wholesale 

our strategy is to be a leading provider of global wholesale telecommunications and business services we offer a comprehensive portfolio of voice data valueadded business and local telecommunications services to a wide array of customers including interexchange carriers resellers cable service operators internet service providers network and systems integrators and content data network providers 

voice services we offer regional access voip services and long distance services both domestically and internationally we are a leading provider of international voice services across the world serving customers on six continents and in over 150 countries in 2010 we will focus on increasing international voice traffic on key highyield routes in addition we offer interconnection services for local and wireless service providers who need to terminate traffic in our networks to reach their end users and subscribers 

data services we offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance wholesale customer networks and to provide connections to their end users and subscribers our data services include private line special access fast packet optical ethernet and ip services each available in multiple options and configurations to support the complex needs of our customers 

our wireless customers in the us represent the largest growth opportunity in wholesale as they are significantly building up backhaul connections from their cell sites back to mobile switching centers at the same time they are migrating networks from tdm to ethernet which will better scale and service the growth of broadband services driven by smartphones mobile broadband and mobile video global wholesale offers a fiberto–thecell program where we deliver to customers a wide array of ethernet services fiber network transport and support their expansion of 3g networks and rollout of 4g technology 

in addition we offer an ip partner port service that allows content owners to connect to our network in a more efficient manner as they deliver content across the internet to subscribers including our mass markets fios customers in 2010 we plan to expand the partner port offer internationally to increase global customer connections into the us furthering our efforts to grow data revenues globally 

value added business services global wholesale offers valueadded business services leveraging many of the same offers available in the enterprise portfolio valueadded services can enhance the customer’s experience with us by providing a more featurerich service offering beyond traditional transport services several wholesale customers also serve large enterprises across the globe and we can deliver valueadded business services in a wholesale model to simplify these customers’ corporate telecommunications and it needs including

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lowercost programs offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the us and abroad may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers application and device providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our services and equipment the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and economic conditions we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs accordingly our competitors may be able to profitably offer services at lower prices the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

for example we have selected long term evolution technology “lte” as our nextgeneration wireless network access technology we expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt lte as their nextgeneration technology and we believe that it will become the principal nextgeneration global standard there are risks however that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of lte or change their selection and adopt different nextgeneration technologies including technologies that are incompatible with ours as a result lte may not become the principal nextgeneration global standard and may not provide us with the global scale compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all in addition our ability to deploy lte on our network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver lte devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications furthermore our deployment of lte may not occur or occur at the cost we have estimated if these risks materialize our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide services to our customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are frequently involved in regulatory proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business results of operations and financial condition 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks impose additional costs impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers for example the development of new technologies such as internet protocolbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology in addition the fcc has several proceedings pending that are considering the imposition of additional requirements on wireline and wireless services for instance on october 22 2009 the fcc initiated a proceeding in which it proposes to adopt socalled “net neutrality” rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet the proposed rules would limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider could manage its network and the services it could provide over the network these restrictions would include limitations related to devices that could connect to the network services and applications provided over the network and priority of traffic moving over the network the proposed rules would apply to all providers of broadband internet access services whether wireline or wireless but would not apply to providers of applications content or other services including many companies with which we compete in the marketplace if final rules are adopted that limit our flexibility in managing our broadband networks and delivering broadband services these rules could have a significant adverse effect on our broadband business restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 222900 employees and approximately 213000 retirees participating in verizon’s benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in costs associated with our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments the federal government has been considering various proposals for legislation to reform the us healthcare system there are also various healthcare reform proposals being considered at the state level while we cannot predict with certainty which healthcare reform initiatives if any will be implemented at the federal or state level such regulation may have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate results of operations or our funding commitments 

natural or manmade disasters could have an adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters terrorist acts acts of war cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing a severe disruption in the global financial markets similar to those of recent years could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business and such instability could affect our access to financing 

  

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 

if we are not able to successfully integrate alltel into our business we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of this acquisition 

we have realized certain benefits from the alltel acquisition including increased revenues market penetration in alltel’s service areas expansion of our network footprint and certain operating efficiencies and synergies as we continue our integration efforts we may face challenges such as the combination and simplification of product and service offerings customer plans and sales and marketing approaches and the development and deployment of next generation wireless technology across the combined network if we do not successfully meet these various challenges and continue to integrate alltel in a timely and cost effective manner we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be adversely affected

 item 1 business 

 

tableend  

 verizon communications inc verizon is one of the world’s leading providers of communications services formerly known as bell atlantic corporation we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of delaware we began doing business as verizon communications on june 30 2000 following our merger with gte corporation we completed our merger with mci on january 6 2006 and its operations are now part of our wireline business we completed the acquisition of alltel corporation alltel on january 9 2009 making verizon the largest wireless service provider in the united states us in terms of the total number of customers stressing diversity and commitment to the communities in which we operate we have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 223900 employees 

our principal executive offices are located at 140 west street new york new york 10007 telephone number 2123951000 

we have two primary reportable segments domestic wireless and wireline which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services these segments and principal activities consist of the following 

 

 the following portions of the 2008 verizon annual report to shareowners are incorporated into this report 

 

  

  

  

 background 

our domestic wireless segment cellco partnership doing business as verizon wireless verizon wireless is a joint venture formed in april 2000 by the combination of the us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 

on january 9 2009 verizon wireless completed its purchase of alltel from atlantis holdings llc and paid approximately 59 billion for the equity of alltel the alltel debt associated with the transaction net of cash was approximately 222 billion see – “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent developments” in the 2008 annual report to shareowners unless otherwise indicated the following discussion of verizon wireless’s business does not take into account the closing of the alltel acquisition 

operations 

verizon wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the us we believe that verizon wireless is the industry–leading wireless service provider in the us in terms of profitability as measured by operating income as a result of the alltel acquisition on january 9 2009 verizon wireless now serves more than 80 million customers excluding markets to be divested making it the largest wireless service provider in the us in terms of the total number of customers 

competition 

in the us we compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers att sprint nextel and tmobile in addition in many markets we also compete with regional wireless service providers such as us cellular metro pcs and leap wireless and prior to the alltel acquisition alltel we also compete with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities–based wireless service providers for resale we expect competition to intensify as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes competition may also increase if smaller standalone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless service providers 

the wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to capture customer revenue and brand dominance with respect to the provision of wireless products and services for example apple inc is packaging software applications and content with its handsets and google inc has developed and deployed an operating system and related applications for mobile devices 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

network 

a key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability we are focused on designing and deploying our network in a manner that we believe maximizes the number of calls that are connected and completed by our customers on the first attempt we plan to continue to build out expand and upgrade our network and explore strategic opportunities to expand our national network coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

our owned and operated network provided service in or covered areas where approximately 269 million people resided including coverage in 99 of the top 100 most populous us metropolitan areas as of december 31 2008 our primary network technology platform is cdma based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology we have deployed cdma1xrtt technology in virtually all of our cell sites nationwide in addition evdo a thirdgeneration packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission is deployed in approximately 96 of the cell sites in our cdma network as of december 31 2008 and additional deployment is ongoing we also provide gsm service and fulfill gsm roaming obligations in certain markets as a result of our purchases of rural cellular and alltel 

we plan to develop and deploy a fourthgeneration 4g wireless broadband network using longterm evolution lte technology that is currently being developed within the third generation partnership project standards organization this new technology follows gsm’s evolutionary path but is different from and is expected to be an improvement upon the previous generations of both gsm and cdmabased digital radio technologies lte is being designed to deliver 4g wireless voice and data networks with higher speed and throughput performance and improved efficiencies many other major wireless service providers both domestic and foreign have also selected lte as the technology for their 4g deployments as a result we believe that lte will provide us with the opportunity to adopt an access platform with global scale 

  

open development initiative 

in 2008 as part of our open development initiative to provide customers with the ability to use devices and mobile applications that we do not sell we published the technical interface standards that the development community needs in order to design such devices we believe that this initiative will spur innovation expand customer choices and produce an array of new products for use on our network and as a result increase customer connections to our network 

spectrum 

we have licenses to provide wireless services on portions of the 800 mhz andor 18001900 mhz spectrum bands in areas where approximately 96 of the estimated us population reside as of december 31 2008 we obtained our spectrum assets through fcc lotteries auctions and allotments and acquisitions from and exchanges with private parties in parts of the us we have licenses for aws spectrum in segments of the 17102100 mhz band that we plan to use for the provision of new services 

in addition on november 26 2008 the fcc granted us 109 licenses for portions of the 700 mhz band for which we were the winning bidder in fcc auction 73 that concluded in march 2008 we have made all required payments to the fcc for these licenses certain of these licenses can be used to provide wireless service coverage to the entire population of the us except alaska we plan to use the 700 mhz licenses for the provision of 4g wireless broadband services using lte 

we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum in a limited number of our markets to meet future demand we can meet spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses if and when offered by the fcc 

wireless offerings 

we believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers will help us to retain our existing customers and those we recently acquired as a result of the alltel acquisition as well as attract new customers and increase customer usage all of which will drive revenue and net income growth 

wireless services 

voice services we offer a variety of postpaid plans for voice services and features with competitive pricing specifically we offer nationwide calling plans for individual customers which provide a choice at varying prices and amounts of minutes of use including unlimited usage nationwide family shareplan and other sharedminute plans designed for multipleuser households and small businesses and nationwide business plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1000 lines 

all of the nationwide postpaid plans we currently offer include among other things mobile to mobile calling which enables a customer to place calls to or receive calls from any other verizon wireless mobile number without the call time counting against their minute allotment night and weekend minute allowances no domestic long distance charges and no domestic roaming charges for calls placed within the customer’s coverage area in addition these plans also include access to the internet through our mobile web service for an additional monthly charge per megabytes sent and received several of our voice plan offerings include data service features such as unlimited text picture video and instant messaging to any mobile number on any network in the us and our vz navigator and v cast services free of any separate subscription fees in addition on february 15 2009 we began offering our friends  family feature which is available to customers on many of our singleline nationwide calling plans and our multiline nationwide family shareplans  the feature allows these customers depending upon their calling plans to place calls to and receive calls from 5 to 10 phone numbers they designate including domestic landline numbers without the call time counting against their minute allotment 

we also offer our verizon wireless prepaid service that enables customers to obtain wireless voice services without a longterm contract or credit verification by paying in advance all of our prepaid plans include mobile to mobile calling in addition our prepaid customers can also access certain of our key data services such as v cast and vz navigator  for additional fees 

data services we believe that we are in a strong position to take advantage of the growing demand for wireless data services our strategy is to continue to expand our wireless data offerings for both consumer and business customers 

we offer an array of data services and applications such as 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 global services 

we offer a variety of global services solutions available using certain of the wireless devices we sell targeted to the needs of our customers ranging from our multinational business accounts to our consumer customers who occasionally travel outside of the us through roaming arrangements with certain wireless service providers outside of the us this suite of solutions including globalaccess and globalemail currently gives customers voice service in more than 215 destinations worldwide and data access on their laptop computers equipped with our gsm pc cards and certain of our blackberry smartphones in more than 170 destinations worldwide 

wireless devices 

we believe that our status in the us wireless industry has enabled us to become a wireless service provider of choice for wireless device manufacturers and has helped us to develop exclusive wireless device offers for our customers and branded handsets that complement our focus on highquality service and an optimal user experience the handsets that we offer are predominantly evdo enabled in addition certain of these handsets have htmlbrowsing capability we refer to these handsets as “smartphones” we offer smartphones from rim palm samsung and motorola and we have gsmenabled smartphones that operate on gsm networks outside of the us we also offer several smartphones that include touchscreens such as the blackberry storm samsung omnia lg voyager and lg dare  

our customers can access the internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards that we offer using evdoenabled handsets with connector cables and on certain oem laptop computers with embedded evdo mobile broadband modules 

all of the handsets that we offer comply with the fcc’s e911 requirements the majority of our handsets are also bluetooth compatible 

  

suppliers 

we purchase wireless devices and accessory products from a number of manufacturers with the substantial majority of our purchases made from lg infocomm samsung motorola rim palm pcd pantech htc and nokia a key component of all wireless handsets is the chipset which contains the “intelligence” of the handset most of our handset suppliers rely on qualcomm for manufacturing and supplying cdma1xrtt and evdo chipsets we do however sell handsets that include chipsets provided by an alternative chipset vendor via telecom 

we depend upon a number of key suppliers and if any of them fail to fulfill their obligations to us we may not be able to provide services or maintain and upgrade our network in january 2009 one of our suppliers – nortel networks inc a us subsidiary of nortel networks corp nortel – and certain other us subsidiaries of nortel filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states in addition nortel and certain of its nonus subsidiaries filed for similar relief in the courts of canada and the united kingdom although we can provide no assurances we do not believe that this bankruptcy will have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our network or on our business 

marketing 

we focus our marketing strategy on offering solutions that are targeted to various customer market segments such as young adults seniors families and small to large businesses promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and crossmarketing with verizon’s other business units and vodafone 

our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions which ensures that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets in connection with the alltel acquisition we are also rebranding alltel’s operations to those of “verizon wireless” during the next several months promoting the “verizon wireless” brand is complemented by brand marketing activities of verizon communications reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of the customer base of verizon communications 

sales and distribution channels 

we utilize a mix of direct indirect and wholesale distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

our direct distribution channel includes our companyoperated stores which are a key component of our distribution strategy our experience has been that customers that we obtain through this direct channel are less likely to cancel their service than those who come through other massmarket channels we had approximately 2500 companyoperated stores and kiosks including our “storewithinastore” kiosks in circuit city and bj’s wholesale club locations as of december 31 2008 on november 10 2008 circuit city filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and subsequently announced that it is liquidating its assets and closing all of its stores throughout the us by march 31 2009 on february 16 2009 we completed the closing of all our kiosks within circuit city stores we do not anticipate that the circuit city liquidation and store closings will have a material adverse impact on our direct distribution channel or on our business 

our direct channel also includes our businesstobusiness organization which is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of our local regional and national business customers as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers we also offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service in all of our markets 

our indirect retail channel consists of agents that sell our postpaid andor prepaid wireless products and services at their retail locations throughout the us in addition national retailers such as best buy walmart costco and target sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services we also sell wireless capacity on a wholesale basis which involves the sale of wholesale access minutes and data services to independent companies that resell wireless services to endusers 

customer service retention and satisfaction 

we believe that high quality customer service is a key differentiator because it increases customer satisfaction and reduces customer churn therefore satisfying and retaining customers is critical to the financial performance of wireless service providers and an essential element of our strategy our customer service retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easytouse products and services in order to promote longterm relationships and minimize churn 

while our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours we also have representatives available 24hoursaday 7daysaweek to assist with emergency and technical customer issues in addition customers can do business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced selfservice applications via our interactive voice response system through our website and via applications accessible from customer handsets 

under our enhanced worry free guarantee a national customer retention and loyalty initiative we have committed to providing our customers with an extensive and advanced network responsive customer service with endtoend resolution the option to change at any time to any qualifying wireless service plan without paying any additional fees or requiring any contract extension an early termination fee that decreases after each full month that a customer remains on their contract and a handset upgrade credit every two years provided that the customer signs a new twoyear contract for a calling plan with at least a 35 monthly access charge in addition our my verizon advantage program offers each customer who registers with our my verizon website free backup protection for the customer’s phone contact list an annual handset upgrade option for qualified customers and periodic notification if the customer exceeds his or her plan allowance another significant retention and 

  

loyalty program is the customer lifecycle management program in which we contact customers at key times during the customer relationship about targeted offers and to provide proactive rate plan analysis 

alltel acquisition and integration 

as a condition of the regulatory approvals from the department of justice and the fcc that were required to complete the alltel acquisition we will divest overlapping wireless properties in 105 operating markets in 24 states “alltel divestiture markets” these properties consist primarily of alltel operations but also include the premerger operations of verizon wireless in four markets as well as operations in southern minnesota and western kansas that we acquired from rural cellular in 2008 as a result of these divestiture requirements we have placed the wireless licenses and assets in the alltel divestiture markets in a management trust that will continue to operate the properties under their current brands until they are sold and these properties will not be integrated with our other operations 

we expect to experience substantial operational benefits from the alltel acquisition including reduced overall combined capital expenditures as a result of greater economies of scale and the rationalization of network assets in addition we anticipate combined overall cost savings from reduced roaming costs as a result of moving more traffic to the verizon wireless network reduced networkrelated costs resulting from the elimination of duplicate facilities and reduced overall expenses relating to advertising overhead and headcount 

alltel’s cdma network covered a population of approximately 77 million as of september 30 2008 as of the completion of the alltel acquisition on january 9 2009 our combined overall network coverage expanded to approximately 288 million people including the alltel divestiture markets 

alltel uses the same primary network platform technology as verizon wireless – cdma – and it has deployed 1xrtt technology in virtually its entire cdma network alltel also provides evdo coverage to approximately 79 of the population covered by its network as of september 30 2008 because our and alltel’s networks employ cdma we anticipate that we will be able to rapidly integrate alltel’s network operations with ours and that the majority of alltel customers will be able to continue to use their current handsets after the integration is completed 

the alltel markets that will be retained and combined with our operations will continue to use the alltel brand for the next several months as we work to integrate networks convert billing systems and upgrade alltel’s highspeed wireless broadband service we will maintain alltel’s existing gsm networks in the retained markets to continue serving the roaming needs of gsm carriers’ customers 

we believe that alltel’s sales marketing and distribution efforts have been similar to ours targeted to addressing the needs of a variety of customer segments stimulating usage increasing penetration and improving customer retention rates through various product offerings and pricing strategies to accomplish these objectives alltel has offered competitive postpaid local statewide and national service plans at varying prices as well as prepaid plans 

alltel distributes its products and services through its owned retail stores and retail kiosks dealers and direct sales representatives via the internet and telemarketing 

alltel’s retail distribution channel included approximately 750 allteloperated locations as of september 30 2008 

alltel’s direct sales force focuses its efforts on selling and servicing larger business customers who have multiple lines of service direct sales representatives are trained to sell to and service the demands of larger wireless customers who often have special service and equipment requirements 

alltel enters into dealer agreements with national and local retailers and discounters in its markets in exchange for a commission payment these dealers solicit customers for alltel’s wireless services the majority of these dealers can service alltel’s existing customers by offering additional services features and accessories and taking bill payments 

alltel also provides consumer and business customers with the opportunity to shop for the majority of its products and services by phone or the internet via alltel’s web store utilizing direct fulfillment phone and accessories purchased through these distribution channels are delivered directly to the customer these channels provide customers with exclusive pricing where appropriate and provide alltel the ability to respond quickly to market changes 

alltel’s stores will remain open as we work to integrate alltel’s sales marketing and distribution operations with those of verizon wireless we will rebrand alltel operations in the retained markets in phases beginning in the second quarter of 2009 and continuing through the third quarter of 2009 as billing conversions are completed throughout the country we will continue to evaluate alltel store and agent locations to ensure that they are strategically located in order to achieve our distribution objectives 

  

 background 

our wireline segment includes two strategic units verizon telecom and verizon business in 2008 wireline revenues were 48214 million representing approximately 495 of verizon’s aggregate revenues our wireline segment is not dependent on any single customer 

 

  

 in the discussion that follows 2008 revenue amounts for each of the wireline units are presented before intrasegment eliminations of 2824 million 

operations 

verizon telecom 

verizon telecom offers a broad array of telecommunications services including voice broadband and video network access and other communications products and services to our residential small business and wholesale customers verizon telecom’s three sales channels operate across our telephone subsidiaries and focus on specific customer market areas 

mass markets offers broadband video and voice services to residential and small business customers broadband services include high speed internet and fios internet services video services include fios tv and other television services voice services include local exchange services including calling cards 800888 and operator services as well as valueadded services such as voicemail call waiting and caller identification in 2008 mass markets revenues were 20974 million representing approximately 435 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

wholesale markets our long distance and local exchange network facilities for resale to interexchange carriers competitive local exchange carriers clecs wireless carriers and internet service providers isps wholesale services include switched access products highcapacity data products unbundled network elements unes and interconnection services in 2008 wholesale revenues were approximately 7571 million representing approximately 157 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

other service offerings include operator services public coin telephone as well as dial around services including 1010987 1010220 1800collect and prepaid phone cards in 2008 revenues from these other services were 1367 million representing approximately 28 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

verizon business 

verizon business offers advanced voice data security and wireless solutions to medium and large business and government customers worldwide verizon business derives the majority of its revenue from us operations verizon business provides services to tens of thousands of enterprise businesses and government agencies including 98 of the fortune 500 companies we have organized verizon business into three sales channels that focus on specific customers 

enterprise business offers voice data and internet communications services to medium and large business customers including multinational corporations and state and federal governments enterprise business also provides valueadded services intended to make communications more secure reliable and efficient enterprise business provides managed network services for customers that outsource all or portions of their communications and information processing operations and data services such as private ip ethernet private line frame relay and atm services both domestically and internationally enterprise business revenues in 2008 were 14411 million representing approximately 299 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

wholesale offers domestic and international voice data and ip services over its global network to carriers and service providers some of whom may compete directly with verizon at the retail level these customers purchase services on a wholesale basis so that they can transport voice data and ip traffic without having to build their own infrastructure in 2008 total wholesale revenue was 3341 million representing approximately 69 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

our international and other operations serve retail and wholesale customers including enterprise businesses government entities and telecommunications carriers outside of the us primarily in europe the middle east africa the asia pacific region latin america and canada these operations provide telecommunications services which include voice data internet and managed network services our revenue from international and other was 3374 million representing 7 of wireline’s aggregate revenues in 2008 

  

competition 

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to intensify further with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking increased market share current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies isps and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and which may affect our future revenue growth 

we believe that cable operators represent the most significant threat to our wireline business cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships 

wireless substitution is an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from companies that provide voice over internet protocol voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies and national and regional providers internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space 

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2008 verizon annual report to shareowners 

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry 

 

  

  

 network 

as of december 31 2008 our wireline network included more than 36161000 wireline access lines 8673000 broadband connections and 1918000 fios tv customers nationwide our business strategy is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market while maintaining the level of network reliability currently provided by our telephony network we are executing on this strategy by deploying fttp access technologies over fiber optic cables fttp provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise based on current technology the fttp deployment also allows us the flexibility to adapt our facilities more easily to future product development new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction we expanded our deployment of the most advanced fiber optic network by passing approximately an additional 31 million premises with fttp and by enhancing it with gigabit passive optical network gpon technology gpon technology will continue to support the services we offer today while allowing for the introduction of new services through improved downstream and upstream capacity 

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm in 2008 we continued to deploy reconfigurable optic add drop multiplexer roadm nodes in the transport network as a result the new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

to fully leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls multi protocol label switching technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the lifecycle cost of current data and voice services and creates a network which can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades in keeping with our strategy of leading in network reliability our service infrastructure utilizes our managed quality of serviceenabled resilient ip network rather than the public internet 

  

we advanced our goal of becoming a leading ip services provider to the global business market by acquiring one of the most expansive ip networks in the world through the mci merger in 2006 we have been focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant services flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we have also focused on the expansion of the private ip network pip to serve all key international markets with managed quality of serviceaware ip virtual private network vpn services verizon’s public ip network is now interconnected to pip through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces these enhancements extend our ip services reach across the globe 

we continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies and expansion of our network to lower overall cost we are integrating ethernet sonet and optics and ultra long haul technologies in addition we have deployed a new next generation undersea cable technology through the transpacific express tpe connecting the west coast of the us to china korea and taiwan 

wireline offerings 

verizon telecom’s strategy is to be the customer’s first choice for communications and entertainment services we offer a variety of packages for these services that we believe are competitively priced

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report the following discussion of risks is not allinclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forwardlooking statements 

adverse conditions in the us and international economies could impact our results of operations 

unfavorable general economic conditions such as a recession or economic slowdown in the us or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services in difficult economic conditions consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lowercost programs offered by other companies similarly under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the us and abroad may delay purchasing decisions delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services in addition adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services if these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on among other things our network quality capacity and coverage the pricing of our services and equipment the quality of our customer service our development of new and enhanced products and services the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry including new technologies and business models changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and economic conditions we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs accordingly our competitors may be able to profitably offer services at lower prices the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits 

if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy 

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

for example we have selected long term evolution technology “lte” as our nextgeneration wireless network access technology we expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt lte as their nextgeneration technology and we believe that it will become the principal nextgeneration global standard there are risks however that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of lte or change their selection and adopt different nextgeneration technologies including technologies that are incompatible with ours as a result lte may not become the principal nextgeneration global standard and may not provide us with the global scale compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all in addition our ability to successfully deploy lte on our network in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control these include the risk that the technical standards required for the successful development and deployment of lte may not be established in a timely manner and the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver lte devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications furthermore our deployment of lte may not occur or occur at the cost we have estimated if these risks materialize our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

  

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

we depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations we may be unable to provide services to our customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain or upgrade our networks because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend including litigation involving claims of patent infringement such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology 

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards we are frequently involved in regulatory proceedings related to the application of these requirements it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services similarly we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses for example the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal and there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed the loss of or a material limitation on certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business results of operations and financial condition 

the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could also adversely affect our business plans for example the development of new technologies such as internet protocolbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology in addition the fcc has several proceedings pending that are considering the imposition of additional requirements on wireless services such as rules restricting the ways in which we can manage the use of our network these rules if adopted could impose additional costs on us and potentially impede our ability to operate our wireless network in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers the fcc has also initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage that could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operational costs at the state level the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on our wireless business moreover many states have also imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry 

increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

with approximately 223900 employees and approximately 213000 retirees who participate in our benefit plans the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability our costs of maintaining these plans and the future funding requirements for these plans are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses if we are unable to limit future increases in costs associated with our benefit plans those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments 

natural or manmade disasters could have an adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters terrorist acts acts of war cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing 

we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets adverse changes in the credit markets including increases in interest rates could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing the recent disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a sustained decline in the stability of financial institutions could affect our access to financing 

  

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including from time to time patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 

if we are not able to successfully integrate alltel into our business we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of this acquisition 

we expect to gain certain benefits from the alltel acquisition including increased revenues market penetration in alltel’s service areas expansion of our network footprint and certain operating efficiencies and synergies achievement of these expected benefits will depend on our efforts to integrate alltel into our business the challenges we may face in connection with these integration efforts include developing and deploying next generation wireless technology across the combined network and combining product and service offerings customer plans and sales and marketing approaches if we do not successfully integrate alltel in a cost effective manner we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be adversely affected

 item 1 business 

tableend   

   

verizon communications inc verizon is one of the world’s leading providers of communications services formerly known as bell atlantic corporation we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of delaware we began doing business as verizon communications on june 30 2000 following our merger with gte corporation we completed our merger with mci on january 6 2006 and its operations are now part of our wireline business stressing diversity and commitment to the communities in which we operate we have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 235000 employees 

  

our principal executive offices are located at 140 west street new york new york 10007 telephone number 2123951000 

  

we have two primary reportable segments wireline and domestic wireless which we operate and manage as strategic business segments and organize by products and services these segments and principal activities consist of the following 

  

   

the following portions of the 2007 verizon annual report to shareowners are incorporated into this report 

  

   

   

   

   

background 

  

our wireline segment comprises two strategic units verizon telecom and verizon business in 2007 wireline revenues were 50316 million representing approximately 54 of verizon’s aggregate revenues our wireline segment is not dependent on any single customer 

  

   

   

in the discussion that follows revenue amounts for each of the wireline units exclude intrasegment eliminations of 2846 million 

  

operations 

  

verizon telecom 

  

verizon telecom offers a broad array of telecommunications services including voice video and data network access longdistance and other communications products and services to our residential and small business customers we have organized verizon telecom into three marketing units which operate across our telephone subsidiaries and focus on specific customer market areas 

  

mass markets offers broadband and voice services to residential and small business customers broadband services include high speed internet dsl and fios data and television services voice services include long distance services including calling cards 800888 and operator services as well as valueadded services such as voicemail call waiting and caller identification in 2007 mass markets revenues were 21978 million representing approximately 44 of wireline’s aggregate revenues mass market revenues were derived primarily from providing telecommunications services to residential users 

  

wholesale markets our long distance and local exchange network facilities for resale to interexchange carriers competitive local exchange carriers clecs wireless carriers and internet service providers isps wholesale services include switched access products highcapacity data products unbundled network elements unes and interconnection services in 2007 wholesale 

  

revenues were approximately 8086 million representing approximately 161 of wireline’s aggregate revenues approximately 72 of wholesale revenues were derived from interexchange and wireless carriers the remaining revenues principally came from clecs which resell network connection to their own customers 

  

other service offerings include operator services public coin telephone as well as dial around services including 1010987 1010220 1800collect and prepaid phone cards in 2007 revenues from these other services were 1862 million representing approximately 37 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

verizon business 

  

verizon business offers medium and large business and government customers in the united states and around the world advanced voice data security and wireless solutions verizon business derives 85 of its revenue from united states operations verizon business provides services to over 70000 enterprise businesses and government agencies including 97 of the fortune 500 companies we have organized verizon business into three marketing units that focus on specific customers 

  

enterprise business offers voice data and internet communications services to medium and large business customers including multinational corporations and state and federal governments enterprise business also provides valueadded services intended to make communications more secure reliable and efficient enterprise business provides managed network services for customers that outsource all or portions of their communications and information processing operations and data services such as private ip ethernet private line frame relay and atm services both domestically and internationally enterprise business revenues in 2007 were 14677 million representing approximately 29 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

wholesale markets domestic and international voice data and ip services over its global network to carriers and service providers some of whom may compete directly with verizon at the retail level these customers purchase services on a wholesale basis so that they can transport voice data and ip traffic without having to build their own infrastructure in 2007 total wholesale revenue was 3345 million representing approximately 66 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

our international and other operations serve retail and wholesale customers including enterprise businesses government entities and telecommunications carriers outside of the united states primarily in europe the middle east africa the asia pacific region latin america and canada these operations provide telecommunications services which include voice data services internet and managed network services our revenues from international and other were 3214 million representing 64 of wireline’s aggregate revenues in 2007 

  

competition 

  

the wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive we expect competition to further intensify with traditional nontraditional and emerging players seeking to capture a larger market share as boundaries between products continue to converge current and potential competitors include cable companies wireless service providers other domestic and foreign telecommunications providers satellite television companies internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 

  

we believe that cable operators represent the largest overall threat to our wireline business cable operators have increased the size and digital capacity of their networks so that they can offer more digital products and services we continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic partnerships or alliances 

  

wireless substitution has been an ongoing competitive trend which we expect to continue as wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative we also face increasing competition from companies that provide voice over internet protocol voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies national voip providers and regional service providers internet portal providers are also entering our competitive space offering free or inexpensive voice calling from instant messaging clients encouraging video bypass by offering and enabling video content to pcs selling content and applications such as gaming music and business productivity tools and obtaining advertising revenues from webbased directory assistance and internet search services 

  

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which requires us to allow potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis unes at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the federal communications commission fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” in the 2007 verizon annual report to shareowners 

  

we believe the following are the most important competitive factors and consumer trends in the wireline industry 

  

network bandwidth speed as both consumers and small business customers look to do more online and leverage high speed connections for entertainment communications and productivity we expect broadband penetration will continue to increase over the next several years although at a slower rate due to market maturity as online and onlineenabled activities increase so will bandwidth requirements both downstream and upstream to succeed verizon and other networkbased providers must ensure that their networks can deliver against these increasing bandwidth requirements we are continuing to build out our fios network to be able to meet the future demands of our residential and business customers 

  

pricing pricing will be a significant factor in two key areas first in the competition between cable and telecommunications companies pricing will be used to capture market share from incumbents second pricing is significant as nontraditional modes of providing communication services emerge and redefine existing categories portalbased and voip calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues customers will be increasingly exposed to these dramatically reduced prices and this will place increasing pressure on traditional communications services 

  

product differentiation as a result of pricing pressures providers will need to differentiate their products verizon believes that there are many market trends that provide potential opportunities customers are shifting from an access to an applications mindset and are focused on how they can leverage their broadband and video connections personalization and increased mobility are critical enabling customers to obtain products and services on demand converged feature sets such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality are becoming similarly important enabled by both customer demand and technological advancement 

  

distribution channel reach as products are becoming more experiential customers are requiring a “handson” demonstration before they make a purchase commitment one way for us to satisfy this customer need is through the use of a retail store presence competitors are offering their products through both their own internal channels such as the internet and call centers and also by partnering with retailers to showcase products small business customers require more and more handson consultation and we are aligning our channel mix to address this need

as of december 31 2007 our wireline network included more than 41 million wireline access lines 82 million broadband connections and 943000 fios tv customers nationwide our business strategy is to be the premier broadband and entertainment service provider in the mass market while maintaining the level of network reliability currently provided by our telephony network we are executing on this strategy by deploying fttp access technologies that replace copper loop facilities with fiber optic cables fttp provides the highest possible bandwidth to the customer premise based on current technology the fttp deployment also allows us the flexibility to more easily adapt our facilities to future product development new optical terminals can be added to the fttp network providing greater bandwidth and new services without any additional field construction to further differentiate our network we began deploying gigabit passive optical network gpon technology in 2007 gpon technology will continue to support the services we offer today while allowing for the introduction of new services through improved downstream and upstream capacity 

  

in conjunction with the evolution of our access plant we are also transitioning our metro local network infrastructure from traditional tdmsonet synchronous optical networkatm technologies to ethernet over dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm in 2007 we began to deploy reconfigurable optic add drop multiplexer roadm nodes in the transport network as a result the new optical transport network provides features optimized for video distribution services and high speed data services while maintaining the level of network reliability achieved with sonet 

  

to fully leverage this new network infrastructure and allow for the more efficient sharing of our network across services we are upgrading our multiplexing and routing infrastructure to use ip ethernet and mpls multi protocol label switching technologies in addition we are migrating from traditional tdmbased voice switching to voip this migration lowers the lifecycle cost of current data and voice services and creates a network which can offer future multimedia communications services by adding service platforms without requiring widespread network upgrades in keeping with our strategy of leading in network reliability our service infrastructure utilizes our managed quality of serviceenabled resilient ip network rather than the internet 

  

we advanced our goal of becoming a leading ip services provider to the global business market by acquiring one of the most expansive ip networks in the world through the mci merger in 2006 in 2007 we focused on growing our ethernet infrastructure to support the full range of ethernet private line and elan services locally domestically and globally to lower the access cost and provide significant services flexibility we are using a converged packet access strategy that replaces the private circuitbased customer access and aggregates traffic from multiple customers onto a shared ethernet and mpls network we have also focused on the expansion of the private ip network pip to serve all key international markets with managed quality of service qosaware ip virtual private network vpn services verizon’s public ip network is now interconnected to pip through security gateway platforms that allow business customers to extend the reach of their private virtual networks to ‘offnet’ sites such as employees’ homes small branch offices and mobile work forces these enhancements extend our ipservices reach across the globe 

  

we continue to focus on emerging optical transport technologies and expansion of our network to lower overall cost we are integrating ethernet sonet and optics and ultra long haul technologies in addition we are deploying a new next generation undersea cable technology though the transpacific express tpe connecting the west coast of the united states to china korea and taiwan 

  

wireline offerings 

  

verizon telecom’s strategy is to be the customer’s first choice for communications and entertainment services we offer a variety of packages for these services that we believe are competitively priced 

  

voice services we offer packages that include local exchange services regional and long distance services voip services wire maintenance as well as voice messaging and valueadded services valueadded services expand the utilization of our network and include products such as caller id call waiting and return call in 2007 we also began offering in most markets a new calling plan that bundles landline and wireless services with calling features and unlimited calling between a customer’s home phone and wireless handset all on a single bill

background 

  

our domestic wireless segment primarily includes cellco partnership doing business as verizon wireless verizon wireless which is a joint venture formed in april 2000 by the combination of the united states wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 

  

operations 

  

verizon wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the united states verizon wireless is the largest domestic wireless carrier in terms of total revenue and the most profitable as measured by operating income we believe based on publicly available information that verizon wireless has the largest base of retail customers that is customers who are directly served and managed by verizon wireless and who buy its branded services 

  

competition 

  

there is significant competition in the wireless telecommunications industry other wireless providers including other cellular and pcs operators and resellers also serve each of the markets in which we operate we currently compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers att formerly cingular sprint nextel and tmobile usa in many markets we also compete with regional carriers such as alltel us cellular leap and metropcs competition may increase due to ongoing industry consolidation if smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers resellers sometimes referred to as mobile virtual network operators who buy bulk wholesale services from facilitiesbased carriers for resale provide yet another set of differentiated competitors in the marketplace 

  

we expect competition for both customers and network usage to intensify for several reasons the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new wireless and fixed line products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes for example we face increased competition from the use of other highspeed wireless technologies such as wifi and wimax which are being deployed to meet the growing customer appetite for wireless communications in addition some cable companies have partnered with wireless carriers acquired wireless spectrum and introduced wireless offerings in some of their markets we are also experiencing competition from providers of fixed line voip services which displace inbuilding usage from cellularpcs carriers additionally as wireless data use increases content is becoming an increasingly significant factor in the appeal of these services this may give content providers and other participants in the wireless value chain opportunities for increased leverage andor opportunities to compete for wireless data revenues 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

  

network 

  

a key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability which we believe is a key differentiator in the united states market and a driver of customer satisfaction we will continue to expand and upgrade our network to provide sufficient capacity and superior coverage throughout our licensed area so that our customers can enjoy highquality reliable service in addition we will continue to explore strategic opportunities to expand our overall national coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses also as part of our initiative to provide customers with the option of using wireless devices not provided by verizon wireless on our nationwide wireless network see “domestic wireless – competition – product differentiation” in early 2008 we will publish the technical interface standards that the development community will need in order to design such devices 

  

our network is among the most extensive in the united states with licensed and operational coverage in 49 of the 50 largest metropolitan areas our existing network covered a population of approximately 263 million and provided service to 657 million customers as of december 31 2007 

  

network technology 

  

our primary network technology platform is cdma based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology 1xrtt technology is deployed in virtually all of our cell sites nationwide in 2004 we began deploying evdo revision 0 a 3g packetbased technology intended primarily for highspeed data transmission in 2007 we expanded our evdo footprint covering a population of approximately 242 million as of december 31 2007 in addition we deployed evdo revision a throughout this footprint which allows for even faster data speeds than revision 0 

  

we plan to develop and deploy our fourth generation mobile broadband network using long term evolution lte technology developed within the third generation partnership project standards organization we believe that lte will provide us with a unique opportunity to adopt an access platform with global scale and compatibility with other technologies the technology is designed to deliver mobile data networks with higher speed and throughput performance lower latency improved efficiencies and global roaming 

  

spectrum 

  

we have licenses to provide mobile wireless services on the 800900 mhz the 1800 1900 mhz and on the 1700 and 2100 mhz portions of the radio spectrum collectively these licenses cover territories in which approximately 295 million people or approximately 99 of the estimated united states population reside the 800900 mhz portion is used to provide digital cellular voice and data services and it was also used to provide analog service in our cellular markets however as of february 18 2008 the fcc no longer requires cellular carriers to provide analog service we are currently shutting down our analog service and expect the shutdown to be complete in virtually all of our markets by the end of the first quarter of 2008 we use the 18001900 mhz portion of the spectrum to provide digital pcs voice and data services and we intend to use the 1700 and 2100 mhz portions to deploy advanced wireless broadband services 

  

we anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand and that we can meet such needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc the fcc began conducting an auction of 

  

spectrum in the 700 mhz band on january 24 2008 this spectrum is currently used for uhf television operations but by law those operations must cease no later than february 17 2009 we filed an application on december 3 2007 to qualify as a bidder in this auction and on january 14 2008 the fcc announced that we and 213 other applicants had qualified as eligible to bid in the auction the fcc determined that bidding in this auction will be “anonymous” which means that prior to and during the course of the 

auctions the fcc will not make public any information about a specific applicant’s upfront deposit or its bids in addition fcc rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in the auction 

  

wireless offerings 

  

we believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers will help us to retain our existing customers attract new customers and increase customer usage all of which will in turn drive revenue and net income growth 

  

our service packages are designed around key customer groups from the young adult market to multinational business accounts we tailor our wireless services which include both voice and data offerings and postpaid and prepaid pricing options to the needs of these customers 

  

wireless services 

  

voice services we offer a variety of packages for voice services with features and competitive pricing plans that are predominantly offered on a postpaid basis with a contract term specifically we offer our nationwide calling plans which provide a choice in amounts of bundled minutes together with no roaming or long distance charges for calls on our preferred network familysmall group and shared minute plans for multipleuser households and small businesses and plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1000 lines in addition we offer a national prepaid product that enables individuals to obtain wireless voice services without a longterm contract by paying in advance 

  

data services we believe that we are in a strong position to take advantage of the growing demand for wireless data services our strategy is to continue to expand our wireless data messaging and multimedia offerings for both consumer and business customers 

  

we offer an array of data transmission and content services such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

global services 

  

we offer a host of global solutions available on certain of the wireless devices we offer including globalaccess and globalemail this suite of solutions gives customers voice service in more than 185 destinations worldwide and data access in more than 100 destinations worldwide

marketing 

  

we focus our marketing strategy on targeting solutions based on satisfying our customers’ needs promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and crossmarketing with verizon’s other business units and vodafone 

  

we focus our marketing efforts on a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage and internet and pointofsale media promotions coordinated marketing efforts throughout our service area ensure that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets promoting the “verizon wireless” brand is complemented by verizon’s other brand marketing efforts reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of verizon communications’ customer base 

  

sales and distribution channels 

  

our sales strategy uses a mix of direct indirect and wholesale distribution channels to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

  

our companyoperated stores are an important component of our distribution strategy our experience has been that customers entering through this direct channel are generally highervalue customers who generate higher revenue per month on average and are less likely to cancel their service than those who come through other massmarket channels we had approximately 2400 companyoperated stores and kiosks including our “storewithinastore” kiosks in circuit city and bj’s wholesale locations as of december 31 2007 in addition our direct channel also includes our businesstobusiness organization which is focused on supporting the needs of our local regional and national business customers as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to receiving incoming calls we also offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless devices accessories and service in all of our markets 

  

we have indirect retail locations throughout the united states selling wireless services including both fullservice locations and locations selling our prepaid products and services such as walmart best buy and target we also sell wireless access on a wholesale basis which involves the sale of wholesale access and minutes to independent companies that package and resell wireless services to endusers 

  

customer service retention and satisfaction 

  

we believe that quality customer service increases customer satisfaction which reduces churn and is a key differentiator in the wireless industry we are committed to providing highquality customer service investing in loyalty and retention efforts and continually monitoring customer satisfaction in all facets of our service 

  

while our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours we also have representatives available 24 hours a day 7 days a week for emergency and technical customer issues in addition customers can do business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced selfservice applications via our interactive voice response system through our web site and via applications accessible from the customer’s handset 

  

under our enhanced worry free guarantee a national retention and loyalty initiative we commit to provide our customers an extensive and advanced network responsive customer service with endtoend resolution the option to change at any time to any qualifying price plan without payment of any additional fees or requiring any contract extension a satisfaction guarantee with our “test drive” program an early termination fee that declines each full month that a customer remains on their contract and a handset upgrade credit every two years provided that the customer signs a new twoyear contract on a calling plan with at least 35 monthly access in addition our “my account advantage” program offers customers who register with our “my account” website free backup protection that stores a copy of the customer’s phone contact list on a secure website an annual handset upgrade option for qualified customers and periodic notification if the customer exceeds their plan allowance another major retention and loyalty program is a customer life cycle management program in which we contact customers at key points in their service tenure with targeted offers and to provide proactive rateplan analysis

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend   

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

  

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional lines between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete effectively will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new services that may be introduced by our competitors changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and pricing pressures we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business accordingly our competitors may be able to offer services at lower prices the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs 

  

if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy 

  

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

  

while we believe our primary wireless technology platform cdma and its upgrades offer many advantages many competing wireless service providers have chosen gsm or other technologies as the technology platforms for their wireless networks in addition in november 2007 we announced that we intend to develop and deploy our “fourth generation” mobile broadband network using “long term evolution” lte this new technology is designed to enable mobile data networks with higher speeds and improved efficiencies however there are risks that current or future versions of the wireless technologies and evolutionary path that we have selected may not be demanded by existing and prospective customers or provide the advantages that we expect in addition there are risks that other wireless carriers on whom our customers roam may change their technology to other technologies that are incompatible with ours as a result the ability of our and such other carriers’ customers to roam on our respective wireless networks could be adversely affected if these risks materialize our ability to provide national wireless service to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

  

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

  

we also depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business strategy and in addition we might be unable to satisfy the requirements contained in our fcc licenses regarding the construction of our wireless network these suppliers and vendors may be subject to litigation with respect to technology that we depend on for our service offerings 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

  

our operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could adversely affect our business plans for example the development of new technologies such as internet protocolbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology in addition the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on verizon wireless moreover many states have also imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry 

  

natural or manmade disasters may disrupt our operations 

  

the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters may disrupt our operations while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events even for a limited period of time may result in significant expenses andor loss of market share to other communications providers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

  

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions wage and hour class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

verizon business 

  

verizon business consists of three lines of business which focus on the needs of our enterprise business customers we are not dependent on any single customer 

  

our enterprise business line of business markets voice data and internet communications services to medium and large business customers multinational corporations and state and federal governments the enterprise business also provides valueadded services that make communications more secure reliable and efficient as well as managed network services that enable customers to outsource all or a portion of their communications and information processing operations in addition enterprise business provides traditional data services in specific markets such as private line frame relay and atm services as well as advanced ip network services both domestically and internationally enterprise business’s fastest growing product line is the internet suite of products that include private ip ip vpn web hosting and voice over internet protocol voip enterprise business revenues in 2006 were approximately 13999 million representing approximately 28 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

our wholesale line of business focuses on the domestic wholesale services markets which includes all wholesale traffic in the united states as well as traffic that originates in the united states and terminates in a different country total wholesale revenue was approximately 3381 million in 2006 representing approximately 7 of wireline’s aggregate revenues revenues from wholesale local and long distance voice products including transport were approximately 1601 million in 2006 representing 47 of wholesale’s aggregate revenues wholesale revenue is influenced by aggressive competitive pricing in particular long distance voice services revenues from wholesale data and internet products were approximately 1780 million in 2006 representing approximately 53 of wholesale’s aggregate revenues 

  

our international and other operations serve businesses government entities and telecommunication carriers outside of the united states and include our skytel paging business the international and other market represents a new revenue stream to verizon resulting from the mci acquisition our revenues from international and other were approximately 3110 million representing approximately 6 of wireline’s aggregate revenues in 2006 of this amount international and other had voice revenue of approximately 1822 million representing approximately 4 of wireline’s aggregate revenues 

  

competition 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly competitive factors contributing to the industry’s increasingly competitive market include regulatory changes product substitution technological advances excess network capacity and the entrance of new competitors in this environment competition is based on price and pricing plans the types of services offered the combination of services into bundled offerings customer service the quality and reliability of services provided and the development of new products and services current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include cable companies wireless service providers long distance companies other local telephone companies foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 

  

cable services 

  

cable competitors have aggressively increased the size and digital capacity of their cable networks cable companies have continued to upgrade their networks to offer more digital products and services they continue to aggressively market competitive bundled offerings that include highspeed internet access digital television and voice services 

  

voice over internet protocol services 

  

our wireline telecommunications services also face increasing competition from companies which provide voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies longdistance companies national voip providers and regional service providers 

  

wireless services 

  

wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices as a result more consumers are substituting wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can also be used for data transmission 

  

local exchange services 

  

the ability to offer local exchange services historically has been subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every jurisdiction in our service territory the telecommunications act of 1996 has significantly increased the level of competition in our local exchange markets 

  

as a result of the telecommunications act of 1996 which required us to permit potential competitors to purchase our services for resale or access components of our network on an unbundled basis unes at a prescribed cost competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward and the rates we receive are subject to ongoing review and revision by the federal communications commission fcc and state regulators see “regulatory and competitive trends” 

  

long distance services 

  

we offer long distance services regionally and throughout the united states state regulatory commissions rather than federal authorities generally regulate regional long distance services federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate long distance services all of our state regulatory commissions except in washington dc where regional long distance is not provided permit other carriers to provide long distance services within the state our authority in alaska is limited to interstate and international services a number of our major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition and existing customer relationships 

  

public telephone services 

  

the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers of public telephone services 

  

operator services 

  

our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator services providers and internet service providers 

  

equipment manufacturers 

  

in addition to producing telecommunications products and computer network devices and systems equipment manufacturers may also provide consulting and outsourcing services that compete directly with products and services we offer 

  

international competition 

  

our international business competes primarily with incumbent telephone companies some of which have special regulatory status and exclusive rights to provide certain services and have historically dominated their local markets we also compete with other international service providers some of which are affiliated with incumbent telephone companies in other countries 

  

network 

  

verizon telecom presently serves a territory of 451 million access lines in 28 states and washington dc we continue to upgrade our network in order to provide an ever increasing number of customers with broadband capabilities our advanced fios network uses state of the art fiberoptic cable and optical electronics to directly link homes and businesses to our network our fiber network will offer us the opportunity to provide our customers with improved network reliability and speed for voice data and video connections as of the end of 2006 our fios network passed more than 6 million homes doubling the amounts of premises passed from the previous year 

  

verizon business owns and operates one of the most expansive ip backbone networks in the world the verizon business data network includes more than 446000 route miles including terrestrial and undersea cable spanning six continents and access to another 187000 route miles from verizon telecom verizon business provides voice data and internet services on its stateoftheart fiberoptic network to customers in more than 2700 cities and 150 countries verizon business currently operates eight satellite facilities located throughout the united states and guam verizon business also operates satellite links to more than 200 teleports worldwide in approximately 110 countries for both government and business customers 

  

wireline offerings 

  

verizon telecom provides a broad array of communications services to our residential and small business customers including voice broadband data and video network access longdistance and other communications products and services 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

background 

  

our domestic wireless segment cellco partnership doing business as verizon wireless verizon wireless is a joint venture formed in april 2000 by the combination of the us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 

  

operations 

  

verizon wireless provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the us verizon wireless is the largest domestic wireless carrier in terms of total revenue and the most profitable as measured by operating income we believe based on publicly available information that verizon wireless has the largest base of retail customers that is customers who are directly served and managed by verizon wireless and who buy its branded services 

  

competition 

  

there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry other wireless providers including other cellular and pcs operators and resellers serve each of the markets in which we operate we currently compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers att formerly cingular sprint nextel and tmobile usa in addition in many markets we also compete with regional carriers such as alltel and us cellular competition may increase due to ongoing industry consolidation if smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers resellers now sometimes referred to as mobile virtual network operators who buy bulk wholesale services from facilitiesbased carriers for resale provide yet another set of differentiated competitors in the marketplace 

  

we expect competition for both customers and network usage to intensify as a result of the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new wireless and fixed line products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes for example we face increased competition as a result of the use of other highspeed wireless technologies such as wifi and wimax which are being deployed or proposed to meet the growing customer appetite for wireless communications in fixed nomadic and fully mobile environments in addition some cable companies have partnered with wireless carriers acquired wireless spectrum and are now introducing wireless offerings to their customers we are also experiencing competition from providers of fixed line voip services which displace inbuilding usage from cellularpcs carriers additionally as wireless data proliferates content is becoming an increasingly significant factor in the appeal of these services this may give content providers and other participants in the wireless value chain opportunities for increased leverage andor opportunities to compete for wireless data revenues 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies new business models changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors 

  

network 

  

a key part of our business strategy is to provide the highest network reliability we believe that network reliability is a key differentiator in the us market and a driver of customer satisfaction consistent with this strategy we will continue to buildout expand and upgrade our network in an effort to provide sufficient capacity and seamless and superior coverage and reliability throughout our licensed area so that our customers can enjoy consistent features and highquality service regardless of location in addition we will continue to explore strategic opportunities to expand our overall national coverage through selective acquisitions of wireless operations and spectrum licenses 

  

our network is among the largest in the us with licensed and operational coverage in 49 of the 50 largest metropolitan areas our built network covered a population of approximately 256 million and provided service to 591 million customers as of december 31 2006 

  

network technology 

  

our primary network technology platform is cdma based on spreadspectrum digital radio technology cdma technology’s compatible 1xrtt upgrade a wireless technology developed by qualcomm as part of its family of technologies known as cdma2000 is presently deployed in virtually all of our cell sites nationwide 1xrtt increases the voice traffic capacity available to us and provides increased data rates further 1xrtt is a modular infrastructure upgrade that has proven to be costefficient and practical for rapid nationwide deployment in addition to 1xrtt in 2004 we began deploying evdo revision 0 a 3g packetbased technology that is a part of the cdma2000 technology path evdo is intended primarily for highspeed data transmission as with 1xrtt we have been able to implement evdo by changing andor adding modular components and software in our network evdo service branded and marketed as broadbandaccess was available in markets covering a population of approximately 200 million as of december 31 2006 coverage expansions and additional market launches are planned for 2007 in addition during 2006 we began deploying evdo revision a infrastructure that will enable faster data rates 

  

spectrum 

  

we have licenses to provide mobile wireless services on the 800900 mhz and 1800 1900 mhz portions of the radio spectrum in addition we recently acquired advanced wireless services spectrum on the 1700 and 2100 mhz portions of the radio spectrum which we anticipate using for advanced wireless broadband services collectively these licenses cover territories in which approximately 292 million people or approximately 99 of the estimated us population reside the 800900 mhz portion is used to provide both analog and digital cellular voice and data services while our 18001900 mhz portion provides alldigital pcs voice and data services our digital wireless service is available to all of the population to which we provide coverage digital usage currently accounts for more than 99 of our busyhour traffic while we provide digital coverage in all of our markets we will continue to simultaneously provide analog coverage in our cellular markets the fcc will no longer require cellular carriers to provide analog cellular service as of february 18 2008 and our intent is to no longer offer such service after that date 

  

recent acquisitions 

  

on november 29 2006 we were granted thirteen 20 mhz licenses we won in an fcc auction of advanced wireless services spectrum that concluded on september 18 2006 for which we had bid a total of 2809 million these licenses which we anticipate using for the provision 

  

of advanced wireless broadband services cover a population of nearly 200 million we have made all required payments to the fcc for these licenses 

  

in august 2002 verizon wireless and price communications corp price combined price’s wireless business with a portion of verizon wireless the resulting limited partnership verizon wireless of the east lp vz east is controlled and managed by verizon wireless in exchange for its contributed assets price received a limited partnership interest in the new partnership which was exchangeable into the common stock of verizon wireless if an initial public offering of that stock occurred or into the common stock of verizon on the fourth anniversary of the asset contribution date on august 15 2006 verizon delivered 295 million shares of newlyissued verizon common stock to price valued at 1007 million in exchange for price’s limited partnership interest in vz east as a result of acquiring price’s limited partnership interest verizon recorded goodwill of 345 million in the third quarter of 2006 attributable to its domestic wireless segment 

  

wireless offerings 

  

we believe that increasing the value of our service offerings to customers will help us to retain our existing customers attract new customers and increase customer usage all of which will in turn drive revenue and net income growth 

  

our service packages are designed around key customer groups from the young adult market to multinational business accounts we tailor our wireless services which include both voice and data offerings and postpaid and prepaid pricing options to the needs of these customers 

  

wireless services 

  

voice services we offer a variety of packages for voice services with features and competitive pricing plans that are predominantly offered on a postpaid basis with a contract term specifically we offer our america’s choice plans which provide a choice in amounts of bundled minutes together with no roaming or long distance charges for calls on our preferred network familysmall group and shared minute plans for multipleuser households and small businesses and plans targeted to business accounts with over 100 lines and national accounts with over 1000 lines in addition we offer a national prepaid product that enables individuals to obtain wireless voice services without a longterm contract by paying in advance 

  

data services we believe that we are in a strong position to take advantage of the growing demand for wireless data services our strategy is to continue to expand our wireless data messaging and multimedia offerings for both consumer and business customers 

  

we offer an array of data transmission and content services such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

wireless device 

  

we believe our position in the us wireless industry has enabled us to become a service provider of choice for wireless device manufacturers and has helped us to develop exclusive offers for our customers and branded handsets that complement our focus on highquality service and an optimal user experience the wireless devices that we offer are predominantly evdo enabled and all of them are compatible with our 1xrtt 

  

network in addition all of the handsets that we offer are headphoneearphone compatible and through gps functionality compliant with the fcc’s e911 requirements 

  

marketing 

  

we focus our marketing strategy on targeting solutions based upon our customers’ needs promoting our brand leveraging our extensive distribution network and crossmarketing with our owners 

  

our marketing efforts are focused on a coordinated program of television print radio outdoor signage internet and pointofsale media promotions we coordinate our marketing efforts throughout our service area in order to ensure that our marketing message is consistently presented across all of our markets our promotion of the “verizon wireless” brand is complemented by verizon communications’ own brand marketing efforts reinforcing the awareness of our services in shared markets and capitalizing on the size and breadth of verizon communications’ customer base 

  

sales and distribution channels 

  

our sales strategy is to use a mix of direct indirect and wholesale distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs 

  

our companyoperated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy our experience has been that customers entering through this direct channel are generally highervalue customers who generate higher revenue per month on average and are less likely to cancel their service than those who come through other massmarket channels we had 2231 companyoperated stores and kiosks including our “storewithinastore” kiosks in circuit city and bj’s wholesale locations as of december 31 2006 in addition our direct channel also includes our businesstobusiness organization which is focused on supporting the needs of our local regional and national business customers as well as a telemarketing sales force dedicated to receiving incoming calls we also offer fullyautomated endtoend webbased sales of wireless handsets accessories and service in all of our markets 

  

we have indirect retail locations throughout the us selling wireless services including both fullservice locations and locations selling our prepaid products and services such as walmart and target we also sell wireless access on a wholesale basis our wholesale business involves the sale of wholesale access and minutes to independent companies that package and resell wireless services to endusers 

  

customer service retention and satisfaction 

  

we believe that quality customer service increases customer satisfaction which reduces churn and is a key differentiator in the wireless industry we are committed to providing highquality customer service investing in loyalty and retention efforts and continually monitoring customer satisfaction in all facets of our service 

  

while our customer service representatives are available during our normal business hours we also have representatives available 24 hours a day 7 days a week for emergency and technical customer issues in addition customers can do business with us at any time without having to speak with a customer service representative through our enhanced selfservice applications via our interactive voice response system through our web site and via applications accessible from the customer’s handset 

  

under our enhanced worry free guarantee a national retention and loyalty initiative we commit to our customers an extensive and advanced network responsive customer service with endtoend resolution the option to change at any time to any qualifying price plan without payment of any additional fees a satisfaction guarantee an early termination fee that declines each full month that a customer remains on their contract and for customers who do business with us on line free backup protection that stores a copy of the customer’s phone list on a secure website the initiative also includes a handset upgrade credit every two years provided that the customer signs a new twoyear contract on a calling plan with at least 35 monthly access another major retention and loyalty program is a customer life cycle management program in which we contact customers at key points in their service tenure with targeted offers and to provide proactive rateplan analysis 

  

  

   

competition and regulation 

  

technological regulatory and market changes have provided verizon both new opportunities and challenges these changes have allowed verizon to offer new types of services in this increasingly competitive market at the same time they have allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings current and potential competitors for network services include other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers foreign telecommunications providers satellite providers electric utilities internet service providers providers of voip services and other companies that offer network services using a variety of technologies many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth many of our competitors also remain subject to fewer regulatory constraints than verizon 

  

we are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business results of operations or financial condition the financial impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities 

  

fcc regulation 

  

our services are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to interstate telecommunications services and other matters for which the fcc has jurisdiction under the communications act of 1934 as amended “communications act” the communications act generally obligates us not to charge unjust or unreasonable rates nor engage in unreasonable discrimination when we are providing services as a common carrier and regulates some of the rates terms and conditions under which we provide certain services the fcc also has adopted regulations governing various aspects of our business such as the following i use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information ii telemarketing iii assignment of telephone numbers to customers iv provision to law enforcement agencies of the capability to obtain call identifying information and call content information from calls pursuant to lawful process v accessibility of services and equipment to individuals with disabilities if readily achievable vi interconnection with the networks of other carriers and vii customers’ ability to keep or “port” their telephone numbers when switching to another carrier in addition we pay various fees to support other fcc programs such as the universal service program discussed below changes to these mandates or the adoption of additional mandates could require us to make changes to our operations or otherwise increase our costs of compliance 

  

broadband 

  

the fcc has adopted a series of orders that recognize the competitive nature of the broadband market and impose lesser regulatory requirements on broadband services and facilities than apply to narrowband with respect to facilities the fcc has determined that certain unbundling requirements that apply to narrowband facilities do not apply to broadband facilities such as fiber to the premise loops and packet switches with respect to services the fcc has concluded that broadband internet access services offered by telephone companies and their affiliates qualify as largely deregulated information services the same order also concluded that telephone companies may offer the underlying broadband transmission services that are used as an input to internet access services through private carriage arrangements on negotiated commercial terms in addition a verizon petition asking the fcc to forbear from applying common carrier regulation to certain broadband services sold primarily to larger business customers when those services are not used for internet access was deemed granted by operation of law on march 19 2006 when the fcc did not deny the petition by the statutory deadline both the fcc’s order addressing the appropriate regulatory treatment of broadband internet access services and the relief obtained through the forbearance petition are the subject of pending appeals 

  

video 

  

the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators under title vi of the communications act and these rules also generally apply to telephone companies that provide cable services over their networks in addition companies that provide cable service over a cable system generally must obtain a local cable franchise on december 21 2006 the fcc announced the adoption of rules under section 621 of the communications act to set parameters consistent with federal law on the timing and scope of franchise negotiations by local franchising authorities 

  

interstate access charges and intercarrier compensation 

  

the current framework for interstate access rates was established in the coalition for affordable local and long distance services calls plan which the fcc adopted on may 31 2000 the calls plan has three main components first it establishes portable interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry that replaces implicit support previously embedded in interstate access charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the slc by zones and class of customers third the plan set into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of 0055 per minute for switched access services once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2003 virtually all of our switched access lines reached the 0055 benchmark 

  

the fcc currently is conducting a broad rulemaking proceeding to consider new rules governing intercarrier compensation including but not limited to access charges compensation for internet traffic and reciprocal compensation for local traffic the fcc has sought comments about intercarrier compensation in general and has requested input on several specific reform proposals 

  

the fcc also has pending before it issues relating to intercarrier compensation for dialup internetbound traffic the fcc previously found that this traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the telecommunications act of 1996 instead the fcc established federal rates per minute for this traffic that declined from 0015 to 0007 over a threeyear period established caps on the total minutes of this traffic subject to compensation in a state and required incumbent local exchange carriers to offer to both bill and pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound traffic the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected part of the fcc’s rationale but declined to vacate the order while it is on remand as a result pending further action by the fcc the fcc’s underlying order remains in effect the fcc subsequently denied a petition to discontinue the 0007 rate cap on this traffic but removed the caps on the total minutes of internetbound traffic subject to compensation that decision has been upheld on appeal disputes also remain pending in a number of forums relating to the appropriate compensation for internetbound traffic during previous periods under the terms of our interconnection agreements with other carriers 

  

the fcc also is conducting a rulemaking proceeding to address the regulation of services that use internet protocol including whether access charges should apply to voice or other internet protocol services the fcc also considered several petitions asking whether and under what circumstances services that employ internet protocol are subject to access charges the fcc previously has held that one provider’s peertopeer internet protocol service that does not use the public switched network is an interstate information service and is not subject to access charges while a service that utilizes internet protocol for only one intermediate part of a call’s transmission is a telecommunications service that is subject to access charges another petition asking the fcc to forbear from applying access charges to voice over internet protocol services 

  

that are terminated on switched local exchange networks was withdrawn by the carrier that filed that petition the fcc also declared the services offered by one provider of a voice over internet protocol service to be jurisdictionally interstate on the grounds that it was impossible to separate that carrier’s internet protocol service into interstate and intrastate components the fcc also stated that its conclusion would apply to other services with similar characteristics that order has been appealed 

  

the fcc also has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met more than half of special access revenues are now removed from price regulation the fcc currently has a rulemaking proceeding underway to evaluate experience under its pricing flexibility rules and to determine whether any changes to those rules are warranted 

  

universal service 

  

the fcc also has a body of rules implementing the universal service provisions of the telecommunications act of 1996 including rules governing support to rural and nonrural highcost areas support for low income subscribers and support for schools libraries and rural health care the fcc’s current rules for support to highcost areas served by larger “nonrural” local telephone companies were previously remanded by us court of appeals for the tenth circuit which had found that the fcc had not adequately justified these rules the fcc has initiated a rulemaking proceeding in response to the court’s remand but its rules remain in effect pending the results of the rulemaking the fcc also has proceedings underway to evaluate possible changes to its current rules for assessing contributions to the universal service fund as an interim step in june 2006 the fcc ordered that providers of voip services are subject to federal universal service obligations the fcc also increased the percentage of revenues subject to federal universal service obligations that wireless providers may use as a safe harbor these decisions are the subject of a pending appeal any further change in the current assessment mechanism could result in a change in the contribution that local telephone companies wireless carriers or others must make and that would have to be collected from customers 

  

unbundling of network elements 

  

under section 251 of the telecommunications act of 1996 incumbent local exchange carriers were required to provide competing carriers with access to components of their network on an unbundled basis known as unes where certain statutory standards are satisfied the telecommunications act of 1996 also adopted a costbased pricing standard for these unes which the fcc interpreted as allowing it to impose a pricing standard known as “total element long run incremental cost” or “telric” the fcc’s rules defining the unbundled network elements that must be made available at telric prices have been overturned on multiple occasions by the courts in its most recent order issued in response to these court decisions the fcc eliminated the requirement to unbundle mass market local switching on a nationwide basis with the obligation to accept new orders ending as of the effective date of the order march 11 2005 the fcc also established a one year transition for existing une switching arrangements for high capacity transmission facilities the fcc established criteria for determining whether high capacity loops transport or dark fiber transport must be unbundled in individual wire centers and stated that these standards were only expected to affect a small number of wire centers the fcc also eliminated the obligation to provide dark fiber loops and found that there is no obligation to provide unes exclusively for wireless or long distance service in any instance where a particular high capacity facility no longer has to be made available as a une the fcc established a similar one year transition for any existing high capacity loop or transport unes and an 18 month transition for any existing dark fiber unes this decision has been upheld on appeal 

  

as noted above the fcc has concluded that the requirement under section 251 of the telecommunications act of 1996 to provide unbundled network elements at telric prices generally does not apply with respect to broadband facilities such as fiber to the premises loops the packetswitched capabilities of hybrid loops and packet switching the fcc also has held that any separate unbundling obligations that may be imposed by section 271 of the telecommunications act of 1996 do not apply to these same facilities the decision with respect to section 271 has been upheld on appeal and a petition for rehearing of that appellate order was denied 

  

wireless services 

  

the fcc regulates the licensing construction operation acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems including the systems that verizon wireless operates pursuant to the communications act other legislation and the fcc’s rules the fcc and congress continuously consider changes to these laws and rules adoption of new laws or rules may raise the cost of providing service or require modification of verizon wireless’ business plans or operations 

  

to use the radio frequency spectrum wireless communications systems must be licensed by the fcc to operate the wireless network and mobile devices in assigned spectrum segments verizon wireless holds fcc licenses to operate in several different radio services including the cellular radiotelephone service personal communications service advanced wireless service and pointtopoint radio service the technical and service rules the specific radio frequencies and amounts of spectrum we hold and the sizes of the geographic areas we are authorized to operate in vary for each of these services however all of the licenses verizon wireless holds allow it to use spectrum to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services including both voice and data services and verizon wireless operates a seamless network that utilizes those licenses to provide services to customers because the fcc issues licenses for only a fixed time generally 10 years verizon wireless must periodically seek renewal of those licenses although the fcc has routinely renewed all of verizon wireless’ licenses that have come up for renewal to date challenges could be brought against the licenses in the future if a wireless license were revoked or not renewed upon expiration verizon wireless would not be permitted to provide services on the licensed spectrum in the area covered by that license 

  

the fcc has also imposed specific mandates on carriers that operate wireless communications systems which increase verizon wireless’ costs these mandates include requirements that verizon wireless i meet specific construction and geographic coverage requirements during the license term ii meet technical operating standards that among other things limit the radio frequency radiation from mobile devices and antennas iii deploy “enhanced 911” wireless services that provide the wireless caller’s number location and other information upon request by a state or local public safety agency that handles 911 calls and iv comply with regulations for the construction of transmitters and towers that among other things restrict siting of towers in environmentally sensitive locations and in places where the towers would affect a site listed 

  

or eligible for listing on the national register of historic places changes to these mandates could require verizon wireless to make changes to operations or increase its costs of compliance 

  

the communications act imposes restrictions on foreign ownership of us wireless systems the fcc has approved the interest that vodafone group plc holds through various of its subsidiaries in verizon wireless the fcc may need to approve any increase in vodafone’s interest or the acquisition of an ownership interest by other foreign entities in addition as part of the fcc’s approval of vodafone’s ownership interest verizon wireless verizon and vodafone entered into an agreement with the us department of defense department of justice and federal bureau of investigation which imposes national security and law enforcementrelated obligations on the ways in which verizon wireless stores information and otherwise conducts its business 

  

verizon wireless anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand it can meet spectrum needs by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the fcc under the communications act before verizon wireless can acquire a license from another licensee in order to expand its coverage or its spectrum capacity in a particular area it must file an application with the fcc and the fcc can grant the application only after a period for public notice and comment this review process can delay acquisition of spectrum needed to expand services the communications act also requires the fcc to award new licenses for most commercial wireless services through a competitive bidding process in which spectrum is awarded to bidders in an auction verizon wireless has participated in spectrum auctions to acquire licenses in the personal communication service and most recently the advanced wireless service however the timing of future auctions and the spectrum being sold may not match verizon wireless’ needs and the company may not be able to secure the spectrum in the auction 

  

the fcc is also conducting several proceedings to explore whether and how to use spectrum more intensively by for example allowing unlicensed wireless devices to operate in licensed spectrum bands these proceedings could increase radio interference to verizon wireless’ operations from other spectrum users or allow other users to share its spectrum these changes may adversely impact the ways in which it uses spectrum the capacity of that spectrum to carry traffic and the value of that spectrum 

  

state regulation and local approvals 

  

telephone operations 

  

state public utility commissions regulate our telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate rates and services and other matters our competitive local exchange carrier and long distance operations are generally classified as nondominant and lightly regulated the same as other similarly situated carriers our incumbent local exchange operations are generally classified as dominant these latter operations predominantly are subject to alternative forms of regulation afors in the various states although they remain subject to rate of return regulation in a few states arizona illinois nevada new hampshire oregon and washington are rate of return regulated with various levels of pricing flexibility for competitive services california connecticut delaware the district of columbia florida indiana maryland michigan maine massachusetts new jersey new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island south carolina texas vermont virginia west virginia and wisconsin are under afors with various levels of pricing flexibility detariffing and service quality standards none of the afors include earnings regulation in idaho verizon has made the election under a recent statutory amendment into a deregulatory regime that phases out all price regulation 

  

video 

  

companies that provide cable service over a cable system are typically subject to state andor local cable television rules and regulations as noted above cable operators generally must obtain a local cable franchise from each local unit of government prior to providing cable service in that local area some states have recently enacted legislation that enables cable operators to apply for and obtain a single cable franchise at the state rather than local level to date verizon has applied for and received stateissued franchises in indiana new jersey and texas california has enacted statewide franchise reform legislation but has not yet finalized implementing rules 

  

wireless services 

  

the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on verizon wireless the communications act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of or the rates charged by wireless carriers although a state may petition the fcc to allow it to impose rate regulation no state has done so in addition the communications act does not prohibit the states from regulating the other “terms and conditions” of wireless service while numerous state commissions do not currently have jurisdiction over wireless services state legislatures may decide to grant them such jurisdiction and those commissions that already have authority to impose regulations on wireless carriers may adopt new rules 

  

state efforts to regulate wireless services have included proposals to regulate customer billing termination of service trial periods for service advertising network outages the use of handsets while driving and the provision of emergency or alert services over the past several years only a few states have imposed regulation in one or more of these areas and in 2006 a federal appellate court struck down one such state statute but verizon wireless expects these efforts to continue some states also impose their own universal service support regimes on wireless and other telecommunications carriers and other states are considering whether to create such regimes 

  

verizon wireless as well as att formerly cingular and sprintnextel is a party to an assurance of voluntary compliance “avc” with 33 state attorneys general the avc which generally reflected verizon wireless’ practices at the time it was entered into in july 2004 obligates the company to disclose certain rates and terms during a sales transaction to provide maps depicting coverage and to comply with various requirements regarding advertising billing and other practices 

  

at the state and local level wireless facilities are subject to zoning and land use regulation under the communications act neither state nor local governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions such as indefinite moratoria which have the effect of prohibiting service nonetheless securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites has been and is likely to continue to be a difficult lengthy and expensive process finally state and local governments continue to impose new or higher fees and taxes on wireless carriers 

  

   

mci merger 

  

on january 6 2006 verizon acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of mci inc mci for a combination of verizon common shares and cash mci was a global communications company that provided internet data and voice communication services to businesses and government entities throughout the world and consumers in the united states

price communications 

  

in august 2002 verizon wireless and price communications corp price combined price’s wireless business with a portion of verizon wireless the resulting limited partnership verizon wireless of the east lp vz east is controlled and managed by verizon wireless in exchange for its contributed assets price received a limited partnership interest in the new partnership which was exchangeable into the common stock of verizon wireless if an initial public offering of that stock occurred or into the common stock of verizon on the fourth anniversary of the asset contribution date on august 15 2006 verizon delivered 295 million shares of newlyissued verizon common stock to price valued at 1007 million in exchange for price’s limited partnership interest in vz east as a result of acquiring price’s limited partnership interest verizon recorded goodwill of 345 million in the third quarter of 2006 attributable to its domestic wireless segment 

  

disposition of businesses and investments 

  

verizon dominicana c por a telecomunicaciones de puerto rico inc and compañía anónima nacional teléfonos de venezuela 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we reached definitive agreements to sell our interests in our caribbean and latin american telecommunications operations in three separate transactions to américa móvil sa de cv américa móvil a wireless service provider throughout latin america and a company owned jointly by teléfonos de méxico sa de cv telmex and américa móvil we agreed to sell our 100 percent indirect interest in verizon dominicana c por a verizon dominicana and our 52 percent interest in telecomunicaciones de puerto rico inc telpri to américa móvil an entity jointly owned by américa móvil and telmex agreed to purchase our indirect 285 percent interest in compañía anónima nacional teléfonos de venezuela cantv 

  

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 144 we have classified the results of operations of verizon dominicana and telpri as discontinued operations cantv continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment 

  

on december 1 2006 we closed the sale of verizon dominicana the transaction resulted in net pretax cash proceeds of 2042 million net of a purchase price adjustment of 373 million the us taxes that became payable and were recognized at the time the transaction closed exceeded the 30 million pretax gain resulting in an aftertax loss of 541 million 

  

we expect to close the sale of our interest in telpri in 2007 subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and in accordance with the terms of the definitive agreement we expect that the sale will result in approximately 900 million in net pretax cash proceeds 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our indirect 285 interest in cantv to an entity jointly owned by america movil and telmex for estimated pretax proceeds of 677 million regulatory authorities in venezuela never commenced the formal review of that transaction and the related tender offers for the remaining equity securities of cantv on february 8 2007 after two prior extensions the parties terminated the stock purchase agreement because the parties mutually concluded that the regulatory approvals would not be granted by the government 

  

in january 2007 the bolivarian republic of venezuela the republic declared its intent to nationalize certain companies including cantv on february 12 2007 we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the republic the mou provides that the republic will offer to purchase all of the equity securities of cantv through public tender offers in venezuela and the united states at a price equivalent to 1785 per ads if the tender offers are completed the aggregate purchase price for verizon’s shares would be 572 million if the 2007 dividend that has been recommended by the cantv board is approved by shareholders and paid prior to the closing of the tender offers this amount will be reduced by the amount of the dividend verizon has agreed to tender its shares if the offers are commenced the republic has agreed to commence the offers within fortyfive days assuming the satisfactory completion of its due diligence investigation of cantv the tender offers are subject to certain conditions including that a majority of the outstanding shares are tendered to the government and receipt of regulatory approvals based upon the terms of the mou and our current investment balance in cantv we expect that we will record a loss on our investment in the first quarter of 2007 the ultimate amount of the loss depends on a variety of factors including the successful completion of the tender offer and the satisfaction of other terms in the mou 

  

spinoff of verizon information services 

  

on november 17 2006 we completed the spinoff of idearc to shareowners of verizon verizon distributed a dividend of one share of idearc common stock for every 20 shares of verizon common stock cash was paid for fractional shares the distribution of idearc common stock is considered a tax free transaction for us and for our shareowners except for the cash payments for fractional shares which are generally taxable idearc now owns what was the verizon domestic print and internet yellow pages directories publishing operations which had been the principal component of our information services segment this transaction resulted in an increase of nearly 9 billion in shareowners’ equity as well as a reduction of total debt by more than 7 billion and we received approximately 2 billion in cash 

  

telephone access lines spinoff 

  

on january 16 2007 we announced a definitive agreement with fairpoint communications inc fairpoint that will result in verizon establishing a separate entity for its local exchange and related business assets in maine new hampshire and vermont spinning off that new entity to verizon’s shareowners and immediately merging it with and into fairpoint 

  

upon the closing of the transaction verizon shareowners will own approximately 60 percent of the new company and fairpoint stockholders will own approximately 40 percent verizon communications will not own any shares in fairpoint after the merger in connection with the merger verizon shareowners will receive one share of fairpoint stock for approximately every 55 shares of verizon stock held as of the record date both the spinoff and merger are expected to qualify as taxfree transactions except to the extent that cash is paid to verizon shareowners in lieu of fractional shares 

  

the total value to be received by verizon and its shareowners in exchange for these operations will be approximately 2715 million verizon shareowners will receive approximately 1015 million of fairpoint common stock in the merger based upon fairpoint’s recent stock price and the terms of the merger agreement verizon will receive 1700 million in value through a combination of cash distributions to verizon and debt securities issued to verizon prior to the spinoff verizon may exchange these newly issued debt securities for certain debt that was previously issued by verizon which would have the effect of reducing verizon’s thenoutstanding debt

environmental matters 

  

during 2003 under a governmentapproved plan remediation commenced at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville new york that processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s remediation beyond original expectations proved to be necessary and a reassessment of the anticipated remediation costs was conducted a reassessment of costs related to remediation efforts at several other former facilities was also undertaken in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the hicksville site into the formerly utilized sites remedial action program this may result in the ace performing some or all of the remediation effort for the hicksville site with a corresponding decrease in costs to verizon to the extent that the ace assumes responsibility for remedial work at the hicksville site an adjustment to a reserve previously established for the remediation may be made adjustments may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at any of the sites requiring remediation 

  

new york recovery funding 

  

in august 2002 president bush signed the supplemental appropriations bill that included 55 billion in new york recovery funding of that amount approximately 750 million has been allocated to cover utility restoration and infrastructure rebuilding as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks on lower manhattan these funds will be distributed through the lower manhattan development corporation following an application and audit process as of september 2004 we had applied for reimbursement of approximately 266 million under category one although we did not record this amount as a receivable we received advances totaling 88 million in connection with this application process on december 22 2004 we applied for reimbursement of an additional 136 million of category two losses and on march 29 2005 we amended our application seeking an additional 3 million category two funding is for permanent restoration and infrastructure improvement according to the plan permanent restoration is reimbursed up to 75 of the loss on november 3 2005 we received the results of preliminary audit findings disallowing all but 44 million of our 266 million of category one application on december 8 2005 we provided a detailed rebuttal to the preliminary audit findings we received a copy of the final audit report for verizon’s category one applications and on january 4 2007 we filed an appeal of the final audit report that appeal as well as our category two applications are pending

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend   

we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits 

  

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional lines between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete successfully will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new services that may be introduced by our competitors changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and pricing pressures because we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business our competitors may be able to offer services at lower prices the resulting pressure on the price of services provided by us may result in reduced revenues and reduction of profits in addition while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely nonunion we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs 

  

unless we are able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy 

  

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

  

while we believe our primary wireless technology platform cdma and its upgrades offer many advantages many competing wireless service providers have chosen gsm or other technologies as the technology platforms for their wireless networks there are risks that current or future versions of the wireless technologies and evolutionary path that we have selected may not be demanded by existing and prospective customers or provide the advantages that we expect in addition there are risks that other wireless carriers on whom our customers roam may change their technology to gsm or other technologies that are incompatible with ours as a result the ability of our and such other carriers’ customers to roam on our respective wireless networks could be adversely affected if these risks materialize our ability to provide national wireless service to our customers to retain and attract customers and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected 

  

we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business 

  

we also depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business strategy and in addition we might be unable to satisfy the requirements contained in our fcc licenses regarding the construction of our wireless network these suppliers and vendors may be subject to litigation with respect to technology that we depend on for our service offerings 

  

changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

  

our operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could adversely affect our business plans for example the development of new technologies such as internet protocolbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology in addition the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on verizon wireless moreover many states have also imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry 

  

we are subject to a significant amount of litigation which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements 

  

our business faces a substantial amount of litigation including patent infringement lawsuits antitrust class actions personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising sales billing and collection practices in addition our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radiofrequency transmitters and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements

telecommunications act of 1996 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints we are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business results of operations or financial condition the financial impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the telecommunications act of 1996 and technological advances 

  

fcc regulation and interstate rates 

  

our services are subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission fcc with respect to interstate telecommunications services and other matters for which the fcc has jurisdiction under the communications act of 1934 as amended 

  

broadband 

  

the fcc has adopted a series of orders that recognize the competitive nature of the broadband market and impose lesser regulatory requirements to broadband services and facilities than apply to narrowband with respect to facilities the fcc has determined that certain unbundling requirements that apply to narrowband facilities do not apply to broadband facilities such as fiber to the premise loops and packet switches with respect to services the fcc has concluded that broadband internet access services offered by telephone companies and their affiliates qualify as largely deregulated information services the same order also concluded that telephone companies may offer the underlying broadband transmission services that are used as an input to internet access services through private carriage arrangements on negotiated commercial terms the fcc’s order addressing the appropriate regulatory treatment of broadband internet access services is the subject of a pending appeal 

  

video 

  

the fcc has a body of rules that apply to cable operators under title vi of the communications act of 1934 and these rules also generally apply to telephone companies that provide cable services over their networks in addition companies that provide cable service over a cable system generally must obtain a local cable franchise the fcc currently is conducting a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether the local franchising process is serving as a barrier to entry for new providers of video services like verizon in this proceeding the fcc is evaluating the scope of its authority over the local franchise process and is considering adopting rules under section 621 of the communications act of 1934 to ensure that the local franchising process does not undermine competitive entry 

  

interstate access charges and intercarrier compensation 

  

the current framework for interstate access rates was established in the coalition for affordable local and long distance services calls plan which the fcc adopted on may 31 2000 the calls plan has three main components first it establishes portable interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry that replaces implicit support previously embedded in interstate access charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the 

  

slc by zones and class of customers third the plan set into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of 0055 per minute for switched access services once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2003 virtually all of our switched access lines reached the 0055 benchmark 

  

the fcc currently is conducting a broad rulemaking proceeding to consider new rules governing intercarrier compensation including but not limited to access charges compensation for internet traffic and reciprocal compensation for local traffic the notice seeks comments about intercarrier compensation in general and requests input on seven specific reform proposals 

  

the fcc also has pending before it issues relating to intercarrier compensation for dialup internetbound traffic the fcc previously found this traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the telecommunications act of 1996 instead the fcc established federal rates per minute for this traffic that declined from 0015 to 0007 over a threeyear period established caps on the total minutes of this traffic subject to compensation in a state and required incumbent local exchange carriers to offer to both bill and pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound traffic the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected part of the fcc’s rationale but declined to vacate the order while it is on remand as a result pending further action by the fcc the fcc’s underlying order remains in effect the fcc subsequently denied a petition to discontinue the 0007 rate cap on this traffic but removed the caps on the total minutes of internetbound traffic subject to compensation that decision is the subject of an appeal by several parties disputes also remain pending in a number of forums relating to the appropriate compensation for internetbound traffic during previous periods under the terms of our interconnection agreements with other carriers 

  

the fcc also is conducting a rulemaking proceeding to address the regulation of services that use internet protocol including whether access charges should apply to voice or other internet protocol services the fcc also considered several petitions asking whether and under what circumstances services that employ internet protocol are subject to access charges the fcc previously has held that one provider’s peertopeer internet protocol service that does not use the public switched network is an interstate information service and is not subject to access charges while a service that utilizes internet protocol for only one intermediate part of a call’s transmission is a telecommunications service that is subject to access charges another petition asking the fcc to forbear from applying access charges to voice over internet protocol services that are terminated on switched local exchange networks was withdrawn by the carrier that filed that petition the fcc also declared the services offered by one provider of a voice over internet protocol service to be jurisdictionally interstate on the grounds that it was impossible to separate that carrier’s internet protocol service into interstate and intrastate components the fcc also stated that its conclusion would apply to other services with similar characteristics that order has been appealed 

  

the fcc also has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met more than half of special access revenues are now removed from price regulation the fcc currently has a rulemaking proceeding underway to evaluate experience under its pricing flexibility rules and to determine whether any changes to those rules are warranted 

  

universal service 

  

the fcc also has a body of rules implementing the universal service provisions of the telecommunications act of 1996 including rules governing support to rural and nonrural highcost areas support for low income subscribers and support for schools libraries and rural health care the fcc’s current rules for support to highcost areas served by larger “nonrural” local telephone companies were previously remanded by us court of appeals for the tenth circuit which had found that the fcc had not adequately justified these rules the fcc has initiated a rulemaking proceeding in response to the court’s remand but its rules remain in effect pending the results of the rulemaking the fcc also has proceedings underway to evaluate possible changes to its current rules for assessing contributions to the universal service fund any change in the current assessment mechanism could result in a change in the contribution that local telephone companies wireless carriers or others must make and that would have to be collected from customers 

  

unbundling of network elements 

  

under section 251 of the telecommunications act of 1996 incumbent local exchange carriers were required to provide competing carriers with access to components of their network on an unbundled basis known as unes where certain statutory standards are satisfied the telecommunications act of 1996 also adopted a costbased pricing standard for these unes which the fcc interpreted as allowing it to impose a pricing standard known as “total element long run incremental cost” or “telric” the fcc’s rules defining the unbundled network elements that must be made available at telric prices have been overturned on multiple occasions by the courts in its most recent order issued in response to these court decisions the fcc eliminated the requirement to unbundle mass market local switching on a nationwide basis with the obligation to accept new orders ending as of the effective date of the order march 11 2005 the fcc also established a one year transition for existing une switching arrangements for high capacity transmission facilities the fcc established criteria for determining whether high capacity loops transport or dark fiber transport must be unbundled in individual wire centers and stated that these standards were only expected to affect a small number of wire centers the fcc also eliminated the obligation to provide dark fiber loops and found that there is no obligation to provide unes exclusively for wireless or long distance service in any instance where a particular high capacity facility no longer has to be made available as a une the fcc established a similar one year transition for any existing high capacity loop or transport unes and an 18 month transition for any existing dark fiber unes verizon and other parties have challenged various aspects of the new fcc rules on appeal 

  

as noted above the fcc has concluded that the requirement under section 251 of the telecommunications act of 1996 to provide unbundled network elements at telric prices generally does not apply with respect to broadband facilities such as fiber to the premises loops the packetswitched capabilities of hybrid loops and packet switching the fcc also has held that any separate unbundling obligations that may be imposed by section 271 of the telecommunications act of 1996 do not apply to these same facilities the decision with respect to section 271 is the subject of an ongoing appeal

florida statutes govern the price cap plan beginning january 1 2001 verizon florida was able to raise basic local rates on 30 days notice once in any 12month period not to exceed the gdppi less 1 verizon florida may increase rates for nonbasic services but increases for any category cannot exceed 6 in any 12month period unless another company is providing service in a given exchange at which time verizon florida can increase its price up to 20 in a 12month period earnings are not regulated legislation was passed in 2003 that allows verizon florida to offset a reduction in intrastate access rates with an increase in basic local exchange revenues upon florida public service commission fpsc approval the offset must be revenue neutral and take place over two to four years in evaluating a petition filed under this statute the fpsc is to consider whether granting the petition will remove current support for basic local telecommunications services preventing the creation of a more attractive competitive local exchange market for the benefit of residential consumers and enhanced market entry the fpsc approved verizon florida’s petition in 2003 and the florida supreme court affirmed that decision in 2005 when verizon florida’s rates are reduced to parity as defined by the statute verizon florida’s basic services become subject to the same regulatory treatment as its nonbasic services

verizon new england inc 

  

maine 

  

in june 2001 the maine public utilities commission mpuc ordered the continuation of an alternative form of regulation afor for verizon maine for a second fiveyear term 

  

the maine public advocate appealed the mpuc’s 2001 afor decision to the maine supreme judicial court claiming that any extension to the afor must be preceded by an investigation of verizon maine’s costs and earnings utilizing traditional rate of return principles on february 28 2003 the court ruled that while state law requires that telephone rates under an afor are no higher than under rate of return regulation the mpuc has broad discretion in making such a determination that would not necessarily require a full rate of return inquiry however the court vacated and remanded the decision to the mpuc for its failure to expressly make such a determination or in the alternative that if such a showing cannot be made that it nonetheless remains in the best interest of ratepayers to proceed with an afor no change in any of verizon maine’s rates was required by the court’s decision while the remand proceeding was pending 

  

in march 2003 the mpuc opened a proceeding to address the maine supreme judicial court’s remand of the 2001 afor decision in an order issued on july 11 2003 the mpuc ruled that it would keep in place the 178 increase in verizon new england’s monthly basic exchange rates pending completion of the remand and maintain certain elements pricing flexibility service quality index of the proposed afor on an interim basis until a final decision on the remand on september 25 2003 the mpuc issued an order reinstating the afor and that order was appealed on january 26 2005 the maine supreme judicial court vacated the mpuc order and remanded the case for further investigation the court held that the mpuc did not sufficiently comply with the statutory requirement that it ensure that local rates under an afor will not be higher than under traditional rate of return 

  

on february 17 2005 the mpuc initiated a second remand proceeding to comply with the deficiencies identified in the court’s january 26 2005 order with the consent of the parties the mpuc proposed to consider a new afor rather than seek to reinstate the 2001 afor that likely would have expired on its own terms before the remand could be completed in the interim while the second remand investigation is pending the mpuc determined it would keep in place the 178 increase and subsequent further increases in verizon new england’s monthly basic exchange rates until the remand proceeding is concluded in addition certain elements of the 2001 afor pricing flexibility service quality index were also extended on an interim basis until a final decision on the second remand proceeding hearings in the second remand investigation are scheduled for the second quarter of 2006 with a decision by the mpuc later in the year

competition 

  

current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long distance companies other local telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 

  

local exchange services 

  

the ability to offer local exchange services historically has been subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every jurisdiction in our service territory the telecommunications act of 1996 has significantly increased the level of competition in our local exchange markets 

  

one of the purposes of the telecommunications act of 1996 was to ensure and accelerate the emergence of competition in local exchange markets toward this end the 1996 act requires most existing local exchange carriers incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs including our telephone operations to permit potential competitors competitive local exchange carriers or clecs to 

  

   

   

   

as a result competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward will be affected by the new unbundling rules described above and the rates we charge local exchange competitors for access to unes remain under nearcontinual review and revision by state regulators and often result in reductions in those rates see “state regulation of rates and services” 

  

long distance services 

  

we offer intralata and interlata long distance services intralata toll calls originate and terminate within the same lata but generally cover a greater distance than a local call state regulatory commissions rather than federal authorities generally regulate these services federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll services all of our state regulatory commissions except in washington dc where intralata 

  

toll service is not provided permit other carriers to offer intralata toll services within the state interlata toll calls terminate outside the lata of origination we now offer long distance services throughout the united states capping a sevenyear effort our authority in alaska is limited to interstate and international services a number of our major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition and existing customer relationships 

  

alternative access services 

  

a substantial portion of our telephone operations’ revenues from business and government customers is derived from a relatively small number of large multipleline subscribers 

  

we face competition from alternative communications systems constructed by large endusers interexchange carriers and alternative access vendors which are capable of originating andor terminating calls without the use of our plant the fcc’s orders requiring us to offer collocated interconnection for special and switched access services have enhanced the ability of such alternative access providers to compete with us 

  

other potential sources of competition include cable television systems shared tenant services and other noncarrier systems which are capable of bypassing our telephone operations’ local plant either partially or completely through substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on fewer of our telephone operations’ lines and through substitution of unes for special access services 

  

voice over internet protocol services 

  

our wireline telecommunications services also face increasing competition from companies which provide voice over internet protocol voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies longdistance companies national voip providers and regional service providers 

  

wireless services 

  

wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices to endusers as a result more endusers are substituting wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can also be used for data transmission 

  

public telephone services 

  

the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers of public telephone services 

  

operator services 

  

our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator services providers and internet service providers 

  

   

operations 

  

our domestic wireless segment provides wireless voice and data services and equipment sales in the united states principally through verizon wireless 

  

verizon wireless is the industryleading wireless communications provider in the united states in terms of profitability as measured by operating income verizon wireless has the second largest customer base of any us wireless provider with 513 million wireless subscribers as of december 31 2005 and provides wireless voice and data services across one of the most extensive networks in the united states approximately 282 million people reside in areas of the us in which we have fcc licenses to offer our services and approximately 250 million people reside in areas covered by our service this coverage includes approximately 90 of the population in our licensed areas and 49 of the 50 and 98 of the 100 most populated us metropolitan areas

competition 

  

there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry we expect competition to intensify as a result of the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry ongoing industry consolidation the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services new market entrants the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes other wireless providers including other cellular and pcs operators and resellers serve each of the markets in which we operate we currently provide service to 49 of the top 50 markets in the us and each of these 49 markets is served by other competing wireless providers competition also may increase if smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers in addition resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilitiesbased carriers for resale provide another set of differentiated competitors in the marketplace also as wireless data proliferates content will become an increasingly significant factor in the appeal of these services this may give content providers and other participants in the wireless value chain opportunities for increased leverage andor opportunities to compete for wireless data revenues 

  

we compete primarily against three other national wireless service providers cingular wireless llc sprint nextel corporation and tmobile usa inc in addition in many markets we also compete with regional carriers such as alltel corporation and us cellular corporation 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

  

network reliability capacity and coverage lower prices improved service quality and new service offerings have led to increased minutes of use per customer as a result the ability to keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through one’s own network is important we have an extensive national network and we continue to look for expansion opportunities through the buildout of existing licenses acquisitions andor spectrum leasing we own licenses that cover much of the country but we will need to spend significant amounts to expand our capacity and extend our coverage area and maintain and improve the quality of our network our competitors also have these needs and they are using similar means to address them 

  

pricing service and equipment pricing is an important area in which wireless carriers compete we seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for their money 

  

customer service quality customer service is essential to ensure that existing customers do not terminate service and to obtain new customers we believe that our quality customer service will be a key factor in retaining our customers and in attracting new customers and those who want to switch from other carriers we are very focused on continually enhancing our customer service our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focusing on improving the customer experience 

  

product development as wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services we are committed to continue pursuing the development evaluation and rapid deployment of new and innovative devices and customer solutions both independently and in collaboration with application service providers 

  

distribution key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points we believe that the optimal mix of direct indirect and wholesale distribution channels is an important ingredient in achieving industryleading profitability a goal of our distribution strategy is to increase sales through our companyoperated stores and our outside sales team as well as through telemarketing and webbased sales and fulfillment capabilities supplementing this is an extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations original equipment manufacturers and valueadded distributors as well as various resellers who buy our service on a wholesale basis 

  

capital resources in order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services wireless providers require significant capital resources we generate significant cash flow from operations some of our competitors also have significant cash flow 

  

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors

international regulatory and competitive trends 

  

for several years the telecommunications industry has been experiencing dynamic changes as national and international regulatory reforms embrace competition 

  

in the dominican republic verizon dominicana faces both wireline and wireless competitors although it remains the principal service provider in all telecommunication segments notwithstanding competition is particularly dynamic in wireless services and the number of emerging operators in long distance and voip is growing verizon dominicana’s primary competitors are orange dominicana tricom and centennial dominicana these three companies all have wireless networks and tricom has a fixed line presence in the island’s principal population centers there are several other companies that indotel the country’s independent regulator has authorized to provide wireless andor wireline phone and internet services at least four of those companies are likely to commence operations in 2006 

  

under dominican republic law pricing is set at market rates and telecommunication companies are free to provide services according to their own criteria indotel is primarily focused on providing a regulatory framework for the industry and protecting endusers’ rights indotel may intervene if parties fail to agree on interconnection agreements or if competition for network services is insufficient indotel has indicated that it expects to address the cost standard it will apply in establishing rates in circumstances where it is required to intervene number portability equal access and resale of services during 2006 

  

in puerto rico telpri operates in a highly competitive telecommunications market all wireline services including local long distance internet access and data face competition from various providers including a facilitiesbased local carrier interexchange carriers resellers cable providers and internet service providers prtc remains the leading wireline service provider in puerto rico in the wireless market vwpr competes against five other wireless carriers and is second in wireless market share operating under the verizon wireless brand with respect to regulatory matters prtc continues to operate in a very challenging environment in april 2005 prtc filed with the puerto rico telecommunications regulatory board trb a new tariff structure for basic telephone service that creates a single local calling zone across the island a number of carriers asked the trb to initiate a proceeding to determine if the plan met the statutory standard after numerous changes and delays in the schedule for concluding this proceeding prtc withdrew the tariff on february 3 2006 prtc plans in the near future to implement a new tariff plan which will address customer needs and market realities 

  

in venezuela cantv’s wireless operations have faced competition since inception in late 2000 the government opened the basic telephone market for local national and international long distance service to competition and issued new guidelines governing interconnection and the use of wireless spectrum at the end of 2005 cvg telecom the government sponsored telephone operator was granted a license to provide services in seven venezuelan states and internet services nationwide in direct competition with cantv cantv remains venezuela’s leading provider of switched fixed local and domestic and international long distance services and is one of the country’s top providers of wireless services cantv is still subject to comprehensive price cap regulation especially with respect to residential services that limits the company’s ability to raise prices to keep pace with changes in foreign exchange rates and inflation the regulator conatel has indicated an intention to move to an efficient enterprise model for establishing regulated rates for basic services 

  

in italy vodafone omnitel operates in an intensely competitive and highly penetrated market it continues to perform well in italy through customer growth driven by successful promotions and a focus on high value customers through targeted retention initiatives vodafone omnitel was awarded a license for thirdgeneration mobile spectrum in 2000 which was subsequently extended from a 15year life to a 20year life in november 2001 during 2004 vodafone omnitel launched the commercial operations of its thirdgeneration network

environmental matters 

  

during 2003 under a governmentapproved plan remediation commenced at the site of a former sylvania facility in hicksville new york that processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s remediation beyond original expectations proved to be necessary and a reassessment of the anticipated remediation costs was conducted a reassessment of costs related to remediation efforts at several other former facilities was also undertaken as a result an additional environmental remediation expense of 240 million was recorded in 2003 for remedial activities likely to take place over the next several years in september 2005 the army corps of engineers ace accepted the hicksville site into the formerly utilized sites remedial action program this may result in the ace performing some or all of the remediation effort for the hicksville site with a corresponding decrease in costs to verizon to the extent that the ace assumes responsibility for remedial work at the hicksville site 

  

an adjustment to this reserve may be made adjustments may also be made based upon actual conditions discovered during the remediation at any of the sites requiring remediation

we face significant competition in our industry the rapid development of new technologies services and products has eliminated the traditional lines between local long distance wireless cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets including other telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers satellite providers electric utilities and providers of voip services while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings our ability to compete successfully will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new services that may be introduced by our competitors changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and pricing pressures because many of our competitors are subject to less regulation and have lower cost structures than us due in part to the absence of a unionized work force and fewer retirees they may be able to offer services at lower prices the resulting pressure on the price of services provided by us may result in reduced revenues and reduction of profits 

  

unless we effectively keep pace with technological developments in the telecommunications industry we may experience a decline in demand for our services 

  

our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to future changes in technology to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost we could lose customers to our competitors in general the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market in addition there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected 

  

changes in the regulatory regime under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 

  

our operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal state and local agencies it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings unless we are able to obtain relief existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could adversely affect our business plans for example the development of new technologies such as internet protocolbased services including voip and super highspeed broadband and video could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology

operations 

  

our domestic telecom segment principally representing our wireline telephone operations provided approximately 54 of 2004 total operating revenues our telephone operations presently serve a territory consisting of 1447 million access line equivalents in 29 states and washington dc this segment also provides long distance and other telecommunication services domestic telecom provides mainly two types of telecommunications services 

  

   

   

we have organized our domestic telecom segment into four marketing units operating across our telephone subsidiaries the units focus on specific markets we are not dependent on any single customer our telephone operations remain responsible within their respective service areas for the provision of telephone services financial performance and regulatory matters 

  

the enterprise unit markets communications and information technology and services to large businesses and to departments agencies and offices of the executive judicial and legislative branches of the federal state and local governments these services include voice switchingprocessing services eg dedicated private lines custom centrex call management and voice messaging enduser networking eg 

  

credit and debit card transactions and personal computerbased conferencing including data and video internetworking establishing links between the geographically disparate networks of two or more companies or within the same company network optimization disaster avoidance and 911 service and other communications services the enterprise unit also provides data transmission internet and network integration services interlata long distance services network monitoring services and telecommunications equipment sales to medium and large businesses revenues in 2004 were approximately 64 billion representing approximately 17 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues 

  

the retail unit markets communications and information services to residential customers and to small and mediumsized businesses within our territory including our long distance services and internet access services our long distance subsidiary provides national and international long distance services in all 50 states to residential and business customers including calling cards 800888 services and operator services this unit also provides operator and pay telephone services and sells customer premises equipment revenues in 2004 were approximately 223 billion representing approximately 58 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues these revenues were derived primarily from the provision of telephone services to residential users 

  

the wholesale unit markets our network operations which principally includes our carrier access and telecom industry services revenues in 2004 were approximately 87 billion representing approximately 22 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues approximately 66 of total wholesale revenues were derived from interexchange carriers switched and special access the remaining revenues come from our telecom industry services principally from other local exchange carriers which resell network connections to their own customers 

  

the network unit is principally responsible for the construction and maintenance of our telephone operations’ networks this unit is also responsible for the procurement and management of inventory and supplies for our subsidiaries and sells materials and logistic services to thirdparty carriers revenues in 2004 after eliminations and combined with all other domestic telecom revenues were approximately 12 billion representing approximately 3 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues 

  

telecommunications act of 1996 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 the 1996 act regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints we are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business results of operations or financial condition the financial impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the 1996 act and technological advances 

  

fcc regulation and interstate rates 

  

our telephone operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission fcc with respect to interstate services and related matters 

  

access charges and universal service 

  

on may 31 2000 the fcc adopted the coalition for affordable local and long distance services calls plan as a comprehensive fiveyear plan for regulation of interstate access charges the calls plan has three main components first it establishes a portable interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry this explicit support replaces implicit support embedded in interstate access charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the slc by zones and class of customers in a manner that will not undermine comparable and affordable universal service third the plan sets into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of 0055 per minute for switched access services once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices the annual reductions leading to the target rate as well as annual reductions for the subset of special access services that remain subject to price cap regulation was set at 65 per year 

  

as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2003 virtually all of our switched access lines reached the 0055 benchmark on june 29 2004 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit upheld the fcc’s prior approval of an increase in the slc cap the current cap is 650 

  

the fcc previously initiated investigations of the interstate access rates charged by verizon’s local telephone companies during the 1993 to 1996 tariff years under the price cap rules that were in place prior to the adoption of the calls plan on july 30 2004 the fcc released an order resolving one of the issues in those pending investigations and concluded that some of verizon’s local telephone companies had incorrectly calculated the impact of their obligation to “share” a portion of their earnings above certain prescribed levels with their access customers the amount of any refund as a result of that finding will be determined in a further phase of the proceeding other issues remain under investigation 

  

the fcc has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met approximately 55 of special access revenues are now removed from price regulation 

  

in november 1999 the fcc adopted a new mechanism for providing universal service support to highcost areas served by large local telephone companies this funding mechanism provides additional support for local telephone services in several states served by our telephone operations this system has been supplemented by the new fcc access charge plan described above on october 16 2003 in response to a previous court decision the fcc announced a decision providing additional justification for its nonrural highcost universal support mechanism and modifying it in part that decision also has been appealed the fcc also has proceedings underway to evaluate possible changes to its current rules for assessing contributions to the universal service fund any change in the current assessment mechanism could result in a change in the contribution that local telephone companies must make and that would have to be collected from customers 

  

unbundling of network elements 

  

on february 20 2003 the fcc announced a decision adopting new rules defining the obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competing carriers with access to unbundled network elements unes the decision was the culmination of an fcc rulemaking referred to as its triennial review of its une rules and also was in response to a decision by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit that had overturned the fcc’s previous unbundling rules 

  

the text of the order and accompanying rules were released on august 21 2003 with respect to broadband facilities such as mass market fiber to the premises loops and packet switching that order generally removed unbundling obligations under section 251 of the 1996 act with respect to narrowband services the order generally left unbundling obligations in place with certain limited exceptions and delegated to state regulatory proceedings a further review the order also provided a new set of criteria relating to when carriers may purchase a combination of unbundled loops and transport elements known as enhanced extended loops eels that increased arbitrage opportunities by making it easier for carriers to use eels purchased at artificially low regulated une rates rather than competitive special access prices 

  

multiple parties including verizon appealed various aspects of the decision on march 2 2004 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued an order upholding the fcc in part and overturning its order in part the court upheld the fcc with respect to broadband facilities on the narrowband unbundling requirements the court reversed and vacated key aspects of the fcc decision that had required unbundled access to mass market switching and high capacity transmission facilities the court’s order vacating those aspects of the fcc’s rules went into effect on june 16 2004 and petitions by various parties to obtain a stay or us supreme court review were denied 

  

on august 20 2004 the fcc issued interim narrowband unbundling rules and a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish new unbundling rules in the interim rules order the fcc required incumbent carriers to continue providing for six months from the effective date of its order unbundled mass market switching and high capacity transmission facilities on the same terms that they were available under interconnection agreements as of june 15 2004 verizon and other parties petitioned the us court of appeals for the dc circuit for a writ of mandamus to overturn the interim rules at the request of the fcc the court held the petition in abeyance while the fcc rulemaking proceeded and directed the parties to report on the status of the fcc proceedings no later than january 4 2005 on january 4 2005 verizon and other parties asked the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to retain jurisdiction on the pending mandamus petition and to provide further briefing upon the release of the fcc order 

  

on february 4 2005 the fcc released a decision on new unbundling rules the fcc eliminated the requirement to unbundle mass market local switching on a nationwide basis with the obligation to accept new orders ending as of the effective date of the order march 11 2005 the fcc also established a one year transition for existing une switching arrangements for high capacity transmission facilities the fcc established criteria for determining whether high capacity loops transport or dark fiber transport must be unbundled in individual wire centers and stated that these standards were only expected to affect a small number of wire centers the fcc also eliminated the obligation to provide dark fiber loops and found that there is no obligation to provide unes exclusively for wireless or long distance service in any instance where a particular high capacity facility no longer has to be made available as a une the fcc established a similar one year transition for any existing high capacity loop or transport unes and an 18 month transition for any existing dark fiber unes 

  

separately the fcc has taken steps to clarify its rules for broadband facilities in response to requests of various parties verizon petitioned the fcc to make clear that any broadband facilities that do not have to be unbundled under section 251 of the 1996 act also do not have to be unbundled under another provision of the 1996 act specifically section 271 on october 22 2004 the fcc granted that petition and the fcc’s decision has been appealed by various parties in addition the fcc has clarified that mass market fiber to the curb loops qualify for the same regulatory treatment as mass market fiber to the premises loops that fiber loops to serve customers in multiple unit buildings also qualify for that same regulatory treatment as long as the building is predominantly residential and that carriers that deploy new broadband network facilities are not required to equip those facilities with legacy capabilities that could render them subject to unbundling 

  

intercarrier compensation 

  

the fcc has an ongoing rulemaking that could fundamentally restructure the regulatory regime for intercarrier compensation including but not limited to access charges compensation for internet traffic and reciprocal compensation for local traffic to date several parties and coalitions have submitted alternative proposals to the fcc for restructuring the intercarrier compensation rules and the fcc has stated that it intends to conduct further proceedings to evaluate various alternatives 

  

the fcc also has pending before it issues relating to intercarrier compensation for dialup internetbound traffic the fcc previously found this traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the 1996 act instead the fcc established federal rates per minute for this traffic that declined from 0015 to 0007 over a threeyear period established caps on the total minutes of this traffic subject to compensation in a state and required incumbent local exchange carriers to offer to both bill and pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at 

  

the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound traffic on may 3 2002 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected part of the fcc’s rationale but declined to vacate the order while it is on remand as a result pending further action by the fcc the fcc’s underlying order remains in effect on october 8 2004 the fcc announced that it had denied a petition to discontinue the 0007 rate cap on this traffic but had decided to remove the caps on the total minutes of internetbound traffic subject to compensation that decision is the subject of an appeal by several parties disputes also remain pending in a number of forums relating to the appropriate compensation for internetbound traffic during previous periods under the terms of our interconnection agreements with other carriers 

  

the fcc also is considering multiple petitions asking it to declare whether and under what circumstances services that employ internet protocol are subject to access charges under current law or asking it to forbear from any requirement to pay access charges on some such services on march 10 2004 the fcc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to address the regulation of services that use internet protocol including voice services the fcc also concluded in response to one such petition that one provider’s peertopeer internet protocol service that does not use the public switched network is an interstate information service and is not subject to access charges during april 2004 the fcc issued an order in connection with another such petition that stated that the petitioning company’s service that utilizes internet protocol for only one intermediate part of a call’s transmission is a telecommunications service subject to access charges the fcc also has a statutory deadline of march 22 2005 to address a third petition asking it to forbear from applying access charges to voice over internet protocol services that are terminated on switched local exchange networks 

  

broadband services 

  

the fcc has several ongoing rulemakings considering the regulatory treatment of broadband services among the questions at issue are whether to require local telephone companies like verizon to offer such services as a common carrier or whether such services may be offered under a less regulated private carriage arrangement under what circumstances high speed internet access services should be classified as largely deregulated information services and whether to declare broadband services offered by local telephone companies as nondominant and what the effect should be of any such classification

verizon new england inc 

  

maine 

  

in june 2001 the maine public utilities commission mpuc ordered the continuation of an alternative form of regulation afor for verizon maine for a second fiveyear term 

  

the maine public advocate appealed the mpuc’s 2001 afor decision to the maine supreme judicial court claiming that any extension to the afor must be preceded by an investigation of verizon maine’s costs and earnings utilizing traditional rate of return principles on february 28 2003 the court ruled that while state law requires that telephone rates under an afor are no higher than under rate of return regulation the mpuc has broad discretion in making such a determination that would not necessarily require a full rate of return inquiry however the court vacated and remanded the decision to the mpuc for its failure to expressly make such a determination or in the alternative that if such a showing cannot be made that it nonetheless remains in the best interest of ratepayers to proceed with an afor no change in any of verizon maine’s rates was required by the court’s decision while the remand proceeding was pending 

  

in march 2003 the mpuc opened a proceeding to address the maine supreme judicial court’s remand of the 2001 afor decision in an order issued on july 11 2003 the mpuc ruled that it would keep in place the 178 increase in verizon new england’s monthly basic exchange rates pending completion of the remand and maintain certain elements pricing flexibility service quality index of the proposed afor on an interim basis until a final decision on the remand on september 25 2003 the puc issued an order reinstating the afor and that order was appealed on january 26 2005 the maine supreme judicial court vacated the mpuc order and remanded the case for further investigation 

  

the court held that the mpuc did not sufficiently comply with the statutory requirement that it ensure that local rates under an afor will not be higher than under traditional rate of return 

  

massachusetts 

  

in april 2001 verizon new england filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte a proposed alternative regulatory plan to replace the price regulation plan that was to expire in august 2001 on may 8 2002 the dte issued its decision in phase i of the case in which it found that verizon new england had demonstrated the existence of sufficient competition for most of its retail business services and granted verizon new england pricing flexibility on the services price increases are not constrained price decreases are subject to price floor requirements in addition the dte ruled that verizon new england should reduce state switched access prices to interstate levels on a revenue neutral basis by increases in residence dialtone rates with respect to residence services the dte tentatively concluded that verizon new england should have pricing flexibility for nonbasic services but that increases in basic services should be limited the dte directed verizon new england to file proposals consistent with its findings 

  

in may 2003 the dte issued a final ruling approving with minor modifications verizon new england’s compliance filing implementing the dte’s alternative regulatory plan the plan gives verizon new england pricing flexibility for most retail business services and residence nonbasic services including second dialtone lines the dte also approved rate reductions for state switched access prices to interstate levels with offsetting revenueneutral increases in residence dialtone rates those rate changes became effective on june 1 2003

competition 

  

current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long distance companies other local telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 

  

local exchange services 

  

the ability to offer local exchange services historically has been subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every jurisdiction in our service territory the 1996 act has significantly increased the level of competition in our local exchange markets 

  

one of the purposes of the 1996 act was to ensure and accelerate the emergence of competition in local exchange markets toward this end the 1996 act requires most existing local exchange carriers incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs including our telephone operations to permit potential competitors clecs to 

  

   

   

   

as a result competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to clecs at discounts of approximately 51 from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the scope of these obligations going forward will be affected by the new unbundling rules described above and the rates we charge local exchange competitors for access to unes remain under nearcontinual review and revision by state regulators and often result in reductions in those rates see “state regulation of rates and services” 

  

long distance services 

  

we offer intralata and interlata long distance services intralata toll calls originate and terminate within the same lata but generally cover a greater distance than a local call state regulatory commissions rather than federal authorities generally regulate these services federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll services all of our state regulatory commissions except in washington dc where intralata toll service is not provided permit other carriers to offer intralata toll services within the state interlata toll calls terminate outside the lata of origination we now offer long distance services throughout the united states capping a sevenyear effort our authority in alaska is limited to interstate and international services a number of our major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition and existing customer relationships 

  

alternative access services 

  

a substantial portion of our telephone operations’ revenues from business and government customers is derived from a relatively small number of large multipleline subscribers 

  

we face competition from alternative communications systems constructed by large endusers interexchange carriers and alternative access vendors which are capable of originating andor terminating calls without the use of our plant the fcc’s orders requiring us to offer collocated interconnection for special and switched access services have enhanced the ability of such alternative access providers to compete with us 

  

other potential sources of competition include cable television systems shared tenant services and other noncarrier systems which are capable of bypassing our telephone operations’ local plant either partially or completely through substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on fewer of our telephone operations’ lines and through substitution of unes for special access services 

  

voice over internet protocol services 

  

our wireline telecommunications services also face increasing competition from companies which provide voice over internet protocol voip services these services use the internet or private broadband networks to transmit voice communications voip services are available from a wide range of companies including cable companies longdistance companies national voip providers and regional service providers 

  

wireless services 

  

wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices to endusers as a result more endusers are substituting wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can also be used for data transmission 

  

public telephone services 

  

the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers of public telephone services 

  

operator services 

  

our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator services providers and internet service providers 

  

   

operations 

  

our domestic wireless segment provides wireless voice and data services and equipment sales in the united states principally through verizon wireless 

  

verizon wireless is the most profitable wireless communications provider in the us in terms of operating income verizon wireless has the second largest customer base of any us wireless provider with 438 million wireless subscribers as of december 31 2004 and provides wireless voice and data services across the united states approximately 269 million people reside in areas of the us in which we have fcc licenses to offer our services and approximately 243 million people reside in areas covered by our service this coverage includes approximately 90 of the population in our licensed areas and 49 of the 50 and 97 of the 100 most populated us metropolitan areas 

  

wireless licenses are granted by the fcc for an initial 10year term and are renewable for successive 10year terms to date all verizon wireless and predecessor company wireless licenses have been successfully renewed 

  

background 

  

the wireless joint venture was formed in april 2000 in connection with the combination of the us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone the wireless joint venture operates as verizon wireless verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 

  

recent acquisitions 

  

on october 29 2004 we acquired a 10 mhz personal communications services license from nextwave telecom inc nextwave covering the new york metropolitan area for 930 million in cash the license which covers new york city and northern and central new jersey as well as westchester and rockland counties in new york provides additional capacity for voice and data services 

  

in may 2003 we acquired 50 wireless licenses and related network assets from northcoast communications llc for 762 million in cash the licenses provide verizon wireless with additional growth capacity over large portions of the east coast and midwest total population served by the licenses is approximately 47 million 

  

competition 

  

there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry we expect competition to intensify as a result of the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry ongoing industry consolidation local number portability the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes other wireless providers including other cellular and personal communications services operators and resellers serve each of the markets in which we operate we currently provide service to 49 of the top 50 markets in the us and each of these 49 markets has an average of four other competing wireless providers competition also may increase if smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers in addition resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from carriers for resale provide another category of differentiated competitors in the marketplace 

  

we compete primarily against four other major wireless service providers cingular wireless llc nextel communications inc sprint corporation and tmobile usa inc in addition in many markets we also compete with regional carriers such as alltel corporation and us cellular corporation on december 15 2004 sprint and nextel announced an agreement for a merger between their companies based on reported information the two entities if fully combined as of december 31 2004 would have been the third largest us wireless service provider in terms of customers the acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals sprint and nextel have announced that they expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2005 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

  

network quality capacity and coverage in recent years competition in our industry has led to lower prices and to the popularity of pricing plans that do not charge for roaming which in turn has led to increased minutes of use per customer as a result the ability to keep pace with network capacity needs and offer high quality national coverage through the company’s network is important we have an extensive national network and we continue to look for expansion opportunities through the buildout of existing licenses acquisitions andor spectrum leasing we own licenses that cover much of the country but we will need to spend significant amounts to expand our capacity and extend our coverage area most of our competitors also have buildout needs which they are seeking to mitigate through acquisitions or through affiliate andor roaming agreements with other wireless providers 

  

customer service quality customer service is essential to ensure that existing customers do not terminate service and to obtain new customers with local number portability customers may find it easier to switch their service to an alternate carrier since they can take their telephone number with them to that carrier we believe that our quality customer service will be a key to retaining our customers and to attracting customers who want to switch from other carriers we are very focused on continually enhancing our customer service our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focusing on improving the customer experience 

  

pricing service and equipment pricing is an important area in which wireless carriers compete we seek to compete in this area by offering our customers services and equipment that they will regard as the best available value for their money 

  

product development as wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services we are committed to continue enhancing our ability to envision evaluate and rapidly deploy new and innovative handsets and customer solutions 

  

distribution key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points we believe that the optimal mix of direct indirect and wholesale distribution channels is an important ingredient in achieving industryleading sales a goal of our distribution strategy is to increase sales through our companyoperated stores and our outside sales team as well as through telemarketing and webbased sales and fulfillment capabilities supplementing this is an extensive indirect distribution network of fullservice retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations as well as various resellers who buy our service on a wholesale basis 

  

capital resources in order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services wireless providers require significant capital resources we generate significant cash flow from operations some of our competitors also have significant cash flow 

  

as a result of competition we may encounter further market pressures to 

  

   

   

   

   

such market pressures could cause us to experience lower revenues margins and average revenue per user as well as increased capital spending to ensure proper capacity levels 

  

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new technologies changes in customer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors

domestic telecom 

  

operations 

  

our domestic telecom segment principally representing our wireline telephone operations provided approximately 60 of 2003 total operating revenues our telephone operations presently serve a territory consisting of 1403 million access line equivalents in 29 states and the district of columbia this segment also provides long distance and other telecommunication services domestic telecom provides mainly two types of telecommunications services 

  

   

   

we have organized our domestic telecom segment into four marketing units operating across our telephone subsidiaries the units focus on specific markets we are not dependent on any single customer our telephone operations remain responsible within their respective service areas for the provision of telephone services financial performance and regulatory matters 

  

the enterprise unit markets communications and information technology and services to large businesses and to departments agencies and offices of the executive judicial and legislative branches of the federal state and local governments these services include voice switchingprocessing services eg dedicated private lines custom centrex call management and voice messaging enduser networking eg credit and debit card transactions and personal computerbased conferencing including data and video internetworking establishing links between the geographically disparate networks of two or more companies or within the same company network optimization disaster avoidance and 911 service and other communications services the enterprise unit also provides data transmission internet and network integration services interlata long distance services network monitoring services and telecommunications equipment sales to medium and 

  

large businesses revenues in 2003 were approximately 66 billion representing approximately 17 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues 

  

the retail unit markets communications and information services to residential customers and to small and mediumsized businesses within our territory including our long distance services and internet access services our long distance subsidiary provides national and international long distance services in all 50 states to residential and business customers including calling cards 800888 services and operator services this unit also provides operator and pay telephone services and sells customer premises equipment revenues in 2003 were approximately 230 billion representing approximately 58 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues these revenues were derived primarily from the provision of telephone services to residential users 

  

the wholesale unit markets our network operations which principally includes our carrier access and telecom industry services revenues in 2003 were approximately 86 billion representing approximately 22 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues approximately 68 of total wholesale revenues were derived from interexchange carriers switched and special access the remaining revenues come from our telecom industry services principally from other local exchange carriers which resell network connections to their own customers 

  

the network unit is principally responsible for the construction and maintenance of our telephone operations’ networks this unit is also responsible for the procurement and management of inventory and supplies for our subsidiaries and sells materials and logistic services to thirdparty carriers revenues in 2003 after eliminations and combined with all other domestic telecom revenues were approximately 14 billion representing approximately 3 of domestic telecom’s aggregate revenues 

  

telecommunications act of 1996 

  

we face increasing competition in all areas of our business the telecommunications act of 1996 the 1996 act regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints we are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business results of operations or financial condition the financial impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the 1996 act and technological advances 

  

inregion long distance 

  

under the 1996 act our ability to offer inregion long distance services in the regions where the former bell atlantic telephone subsidiaries operate as local exchange carriers was largely dependent on satisfying specified requirements these requirements included a 14point “competitive checklist” of steps which we must take to help competitors offer local services through resale through purchase of unbundled network elements unes or by interconnecting their own networks to ours we were required to demonstrate to the federal communications commission fcc that our entry into the inregion long distance market would be in the public interest 

  

we now have authority from the fcc to offer inregion long distance service in all 14 of the former bell atlantic jurisdictions the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia remanded the massachusetts order to the fcc for further explanation on one issue but left our long distance authority in effect the fcc’s orders for the remaining jurisdictions were upheld on appeal or no appeal was filed 

  

fcc regulation and interstate rates 

  

our telephone operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to interstate services and related matters 

  

access charges and universal service 

  

on may 31 2000 the fcc adopted the coalition for affordable local and long distance services calls plan as a comprehensive fiveyear plan for regulation of interstate access charges the calls plan has three main components first it establishes a portable interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry this explicit support replaces implicit support embedded in interstate access charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the slc by zones and class of customers in a manner that will not undermine comparable and affordable universal service third the plan sets into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of 0055 per minute for switched access services once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices the annual reductions leading to the target rate as well as annual reductions for the subset of special access services that remain subject to price cap regulation was set at 65 per year 

  

as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2003 virtually all of our switched access lines reached the 0055 benchmark 

  

the fcc has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met approximately 55 of special access revenues are now removed from price regulation 

  

in november 1999 the fcc adopted a new mechanism for providing universal service support to highcost areas served by large local telephone companies this funding mechanism provides additional support for local telephone services in several states served by our telephone operations this system has been supplemented by the new fcc access charge plan described above on october 16 2003 in response to a previous court decision the fcc announced a decision providing additional justification for its nonrural highcost universal support mechanism and modifying it in part the fcc also has proceedings underway to evaluate possible changes to its current rules for assessing contributions to the universal service fund any change in the current assessment mechanism could result in a change in the contribution that local telephone companies must make and that would have to be collected from customers 

  

unbundling of network elements 

  

on february 20 2003 the fcc announced a decision adopting new rules defining the obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competing carriers with access to unes the decision was the culmination of an fcc rulemaking referred to as its triennial review of its une rules and also was in response to a decision by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the us court of appeals for the dc circuit had overturned the fcc’s previous unbundling rules on the grounds that the fcc did not adequately consider the limitations of the “necessary and impair” standards of the 1996 act when it chose national rules for unbundling and that it failed to consider the relevance of competition from other types of service providers including cable and satellite 

  

the text of the order and accompanying rules was released on august 21 2003 with respect to broadband facilities such as mass market fiber to the premises loops and packet switching that order generally removed unbundling obligations under section 251 of the 1996 act with respect to narrowband services the order generally left unbundling obligations in place with certain limited exceptions and delegated to state regulatory proceedings a further review the order also provided a new set of criteria relating to when carriers may purchase a combination of unbundled loops and transport elements known as enhanced extended loops eels 

  

the fcc’s order significantly increases arbitrage opportunities by making it easier for carriers to use eels for nonlocal service at regulated prices set using the pricing formula that applies to unes rather than competitive special access prices in addition the fcc’s order eliminates important safeguards that protected against this kind of arbitrage including the fcc’s previous rule against comingling unbundled elements and other services as a result we estimate the impact on earnings related to this portion of the fcc’s order to be potentially 4 cents to 6 cents per diluted share in 2004 

  

multiple parties including verizon appealed various aspects of the decision multiple parties also have asked the fcc to clarify or reconsider various aspects of its order and verizon has petitioned the fcc to make clear that any broadband facilities that do not have to be unbundled under section 251 of the 1996 act also do not have to be unbundled under another provision of the 1996 act on march 2 2004 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued an order upholding the fcc in part and overturning its order in part the court upheld the fcc with respect to broadband facilities on the narrowband unbundling requirements and on the eels rules the court reversed key aspects of the fcc decision the court’s reversal of the fcc will not go into effect for 60 days following the ruling or until a petition for rehearing is denied or granted 

  

intercarrier compensation 

  

on april 27 2001 the fcc released an order addressing intercarrier compensation for dialup connections for internetbound traffic the fcc found that internetbound traffic is interstate and subject to the fcc’s jurisdiction moreover the fcc again found that internetbound traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the 1996 act instead the fcc established federal rates per minute for this traffic that decline from 0015 to 0007 over a threeyear period the fcc order also sets caps on the total minutes of this traffic that may be subject to any intercarrier compensation and requires that incumbent local exchange carriers must offer to both bill and pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound traffic on may 3 2002 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected part of the fcc’s rationale for its april 27 2001 order but declined to vacate the order while it is on remand as a result pending further action by the fcc the fcc’s underlying order remains in effect 

  

more generally the fcc has an ongoing rulemaking that could fundamentally restructure the regulatory regime for intercarrier compensation including but not limited to access charges compensation for internet traffic and reciprocal compensation for local traffic the fcc also is considering multiple petitions asking it to declare whether and under what circumstances services that employ internet protocol are subject to access charges under current law or asking it to forbear from any requirement to pay access charges on some such services the fcc also has announced that it intends to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to address the regulation of voice over internet protocol services generally 

  

broadband services 

  

the fcc has several ongoing rulemakings considering the regulatory treatment of broadband services among the questions at issue are whether to require local telephone companies like verizon to offer such services as a common carrier or whether such services may be offered under a potentially less regulated private carriage arrangement and whether to declare broadband services offered by local telephone companies as nondominant and what the effect should be of any such classification 

  

state regulation of rates and services

verizon florida inc 

  

florida statutes govern the price cap plan beginning january 1 2001 verizon florida was able to raise basic local rates on 30 days notice once in any 12month period not to exceed the gdppi less 1 verizon florida may increase rates for nonbasic services but increases for any category cannot exceed 6 in any 12month period unless another company is providing service in a given exchange at which time verizon florida can increase its price up to 20 in a 12month period earnings are not regulated legislation was passed in 2003 that allows verizon florida to offset a reduction in intrastate access rates with an increase in basic local exchange revenues upon florida public service commission fpsc approval the offset must be revenue neutral and take place over two to four years in evaluating the petition the fpsc is to consider whether granting the petition will remove current support for basic local telecommunications services preventing the creation of a more attractive competitive local exchange market for the benefit of residential consumers and enhanced market entry when verizon florida’s rates 

  

are reduced to parity as defined by the statute verizon florida’s basic services become subject to the same regulatory treatment as its nonbasic services

verizon new england inc 

  

maine 

  

in june 2001 the maine public utilities commission mpuc ordered the continuation of an alternative form of regulation afor for verizon maine for a second fiveyear term key aspects of the plan 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the maine public advocate appealed the mpuc’s 2001 afor decision to the maine supreme judicial court claiming that any extension to the afor must be preceded by an investigation of verizon maine’s costs and earnings utilizing traditional rate of return principles on february 28 2003 the court ruled that while state law requires that telephone rates under an afor are no higher than under rate of return regulation the mpuc has broad discretion in making such a determination that would not necessarily require a full rate of return inquiry however the court vacated and remanded the decision to the mpuc for its failure to expressly make such a determination or in the alternative that if such a showing cannot be made that it nonetheless remains in the best interest of ratepayers to proceed with an afor no change in any of verizon maine’s rates was required by the court’s decision while the remand proceeding was pending 

  

in march 2003 the mpuc opened a proceeding to address the maine supreme judicial court’s remand of the 2001 afor decision in an order issued on july 11 2003 the mpuc ruled that it would keep in place the 178 increase in verizon new england’s monthly basic exchange rates pending completion of the remand and maintain certain elements pricing flexibility service quality index of the proposed afor on an interim basis until a final decision on the remand on september 25 2003 the puc issued an order reinstating the afor certain parties have appealed that decision to the maine supreme judicial court and the appeal is pending 

  

massachusetts 

  

in april 2001 verizon new england filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte a proposed alternative regulatory plan to replace the price regulation plan that was to expire in august 2001 on may 8 2002 the dte issued its decision in phase i of the case in which it found that verizon new england had demonstrated the existence of sufficient competition for most of its retail business services and granted verizon new england pricing flexibility on the services price increases are not constrained price decreases are subject to price floor requirements in addition the dte ruled that verizon new england should reduce state switched access prices to interstate levels on a revenue neutral basis by increases in residence dialtone rates with respect to residence services the dte tentatively concluded that verizon 

  

new england should have pricing flexibility for nonbasic services but that increases in basic services should be limited the dte directed verizon new england to file proposals consistent with its findings 

  

in may 2003 the dte issued a final ruling approving with minor modifications verizon new england’s compliance filing implementing the dte’s alternative regulatory plan the plan gives verizon new england pricing flexibility for most retail business services and residence nonbasic services including second dialtone lines the dte also approved rate reductions for state switched access prices to interstate levels with offsetting revenueneutral increases in residence dialtone rates those rate changes became effective on june 1 2003

competition 

  

current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long distance companies other local telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 

  

local exchange services 

  

the ability to offer local exchange services historically has been subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every jurisdiction in our service territory the 1996 act has significantly increased the level of competition in our local exchange markets 

  

one of the purposes of the 1996 act was to ensure and accelerate the emergence of competition in local exchange markets toward this end the 1996 act requires most existing local exchange carriers incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs including our telephone operations to permit potential competitors clecs to 

  

   

   

   

as a result competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations are generally required to sell their services to clecs at discounts of approximately 56 from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers the rates we charge local exchange competitors for access to unes remain under nearcontinual review and revision by state regulators and often result in reductions in those rates see “state regulation of rates and services” 

  

long distance services 

  

we offer intralata and interlata long distance services intralata toll calls originate and terminate within the same lata but generally cover a greater distance than a local call state regulatory commissions rather than federal authorities generally regulate these services federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll services all of our state regulatory commissions except in the district of columbia where intralata toll service is not provided permit other carriers to offer intralata toll services within the state interlata toll calls terminate outside the lata of origination we now offer long distance services throughout the united states capping a sevenyear effort our authority in alaska is limited to interstate and international services a number of our major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition and existing customer relationships 

  

alternative access services 

  

a substantial portion of our telephone operations’ revenues from business and government customers is derived from a relatively small number of large multipleline subscribers 

  

we face competition from alternative communications systems constructed by large endusers interexchange carriers and alternative access vendors which are capable of originating andor terminating calls without the use of our plant the fcc’s orders requiring us to offer collocated interconnection for special and switched access services have enhanced the ability of such alternative access providers to compete with us 

  

other potential sources of competition include cable television systems shared tenant services and other noncarrier systems which are capable of bypassing our telephone operations’ local plant either partially or completely through substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on fewer of our telephone operations’ lines 

  

wireless services 

  

wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices to endusers as a result more endusers are substituting wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can also be used for data transmission 

  

public telephone services 

  

the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers of public telephone services 

  

operator services 

  

our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator services providers and internet service providers 

  

domestic wireless 

  

operations 

  

our domestic wireless segment provides wireless voice and data services and equipment sales in the united states principally through verizon wireless 

  

verizon wireless is the leading wireless communications provider in the united states in terms of the number of subscribers revenues and operating income verizon wireless has the largest customer base of any us wireless provider with 375 million wireless subscribers as of december 31 2003 and provides wireless voice and data services across the united states approximately 262 million people reside in areas of the us in which we have fcc licenses to offer our services and approximately 236 million people reside in areas covered by our service this coverage includes approximately 90 of the population in our licensed areas and 49 of the 50 and 97 of the 100 most populated us metropolitan areas 

  

wireless licenses are granted by the fcc for an initial 10year term and are renewable for successive 10year terms to date all verizon wireless and predecessor company wireless licenses have been successfully renewed 

  

background 

  

the wireless joint venture was formed in april 2000 in connection with the combination of the us wireless operations and interests of verizon and vodafone group plc vodafone the wireless joint venture operates as verizon wireless verizon owns a controlling 55 interest in verizon wireless and vodafone owns the remaining 45 

  

recent acquisitions 

  

spectrum acquisition 

  

in may 2003 we acquired 50 wireless licenses and related network assets from northcoast communications llc for 762 million in cash the licenses provide verizon wireless with additional growth capacity over large portions of the east coast and midwest total population served by the licenses is approximately 47 million 

  

price communications 

  

in august 2002 verizon wireless and price communications corp price combined price’s wireless business with a portion of verizon wireless in a transaction valued at approximately 17 billion including 550 million of net debt the resulting limited partnership is controlled and managed by verizon wireless in exchange for its contributed assets price received a limited partnership interest in the new partnership which is exchangeable into common stock of verizon wireless if an initial public offering of that stock occurs or into the common stock of verizon on the fourth anniversary of the asset contribution date if the initial public offering of verizon wireless common stock does not occur prior to then the price of the verizon common stock used in determining the number of verizon common shares received in an exchange is also subject to a maximum and minimum amount 

  

competition 

  

there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry we expect competition to intensify as a result of the higher penetration levels that currently exist in the industry the introduction of wireless local number portability lnp the development and deployment of new technologies the introduction of new products and services the availability of additional spectrum both licensed and unlicensed and regulatory changes other wireless providers including operators and resellers serve each of the markets in which we compete we currently provide service to 49 of the top 50 markets in the us and each of these 49 markets has an average of five other competing wireless providers competition also may increase to the extent that smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers in addition resellers and mobile virtual network operators who buy bulk wholesale service from carriers for resale provide another set of differentiated competitors in the marketplace 

  

we compete primarily against five other major wireless service providers att wireless cingular wireless nextel communications sprint pcs and tmobile usa in addition in many markets we also compete with regional carriers such as alltel and us cellular the wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years including the recently announced acquisition of att wireless by cingular wireless and this trend may continue this consolidation trend could enhance the ability of wireless service providers with substantial financial technical marketing and other resources to compete with our offerings 

  

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry 

  

network technology quality and coverage  in recent years competition in our industry has led to lower prices and to the popularity of pricing plans that do not charge for roaming as a result the ability to offer high quality national coverage through one’s own network is important we have a more extensive network than any of our competitors and we continue to look for expansion opportunities either through the buildout of existing licenses acquisitions roaming agreements andor spectrum leasing 

  

customer service  quality customer service is essential to ensure that existing subscribers do not terminate service and to obtain new subscribers with lnp customers may find it easier to switch their service to an alternate carrier since they can take their telephone number with them to that carrier we believe that our quality customer service will be a key to retaining our customers and to attracting customers who want to switch from other carriers 

  

pricing  service pricing is an important element on which wireless carries compete we offer our customers services that we believe represent the best available value for their money 

  

distribution  key to achieving our sales success is the reach and quality of our sales channels and distribution points we believe that the correct mix of direct indirect and resale distribution channels is a necessary ingredient in achieving industryleading sales a goal of our distribution strategy is to increase sales through our companyowned stores and our outside sales team as well as through telemarketing and webbased sales and fulfillment capabilities 

  

capital resources  in order to expand capacity and build out networks and introduce new products and services wireless providers require significant capital resources 

  

as a result of competition we may encounter further market pressures to 

  

   

   

   

   

these market pressures could cause us to experience lower revenues margins and average revenue per user as well as increased capital spending to ensure proper capacity levels 

  

our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the industry including the factors described above as well as new services and technologies changes in consumer preferences regulatory changes demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors

international regulatory and competitive trends 

  

for several years the telecommunications industry has been experiencing dynamic changes as national and international regulatory reforms embrace competition 

  

in canada the wireless services market has long been highly competitive and its local switched services voice market was effectively opened to full competition in 1997 while telus currently experiences and expects continued strong competition within its wireline voice data and internet and wireless businesses it continues to be the dominant telecommunications provider in western canada the canadian radiotelevision and telecommunications commission crtc may not regulate services or classes of services if it finds that those services are subject to an adequate degree of competition generally wireless services are not regulated additionally selected wireline services such as long distance and data are lightly regulated wireline services however generally continue to be subject to a higher degree of regulation the crtc instituted a price cap regulatory regime for a number of local services in 2002 for a fouryear period 

  

in the dominican republic verizon faces both wireline and wireless competitors although it remains the principal service provider in all telecommunication segments the dominican republic’s regulatory environment is generally favorable and pricing is set at market rates 

  

in puerto rico five other facilitiesbased providers operate in the wireless market all wireline services including local long distance internet access and data face competition from a facilitiesbased local carrier interexchange carriers resellers cable providers and internet service providers prtc is the leading wireline service provider in puerto rico and second in wireless market share operating under the verizon wireless brand with respect to regulatory matters prtc operates in a very challenging environment the puerto rico telecommunications regulatory board trb issued orders in october 2001 and february 2002 which called for cash refunds and substantial reductions in access rates for intraisland long distance service prtc appealed the order with the puerto rico circuit court of appeals which stayed the orders and heard the appeal the court rejected the claims of prtc in august 2003 and denied prtc’s reconsideration request in october 2003 the company filed in october 2003 a writ of certiorari before the puerto rico supreme court challenging the order and particularly the cash refund aspect of the order in november 2003 prtc agreed with the trb to implement the reduction in access rates and replace the cash refund portion of the order with an expansion of local exchange areas rate adjustments to reflect these changes certain local rate credits and the elimination of touchtone charges while the trb has accepted and approved these commitments it has not issued a final resolution and order to terminate the refund provisions in the order in addition some of the interexchange carriers have challenged the expansion of the local exchange areas portion of this commitment which is pending with the trb 

  

in venezuela cantv’s wireless operations have faced competition since inception in late 2000 the government opened the basic telephone market for local national and international long distance service to competition and issued new guidelines governing interconnection and the use of wireless spectrum cantv remains venezuela’s leading provider of switched fixed local and domestic and international long distance services and is one of the country’s top providers of wireless services cantv is subject to comprehensive rate regulation especially with respect to residential services that limits the company’s ability to raise prices to keep pace with changes in foreign exchange rates and inflation 

  

in italy vodafone omnitel was awarded a license for thirdgeneration mobile spectrum in 2000 which was extended from a 15year life to a 20year life in november 2001 it is expected that vodafone omnitel will launch commercial operations of thirdgeneration network services during 2004 

  

in slovakia eurotel bratislava was awarded a license for the thirdgeneration mobile spectrum in july 2002 

  

recent developments 

  

telephone access lines 

  

as we have stated in the past verizon continually evaluates its assets and properties for strategic fit and financial performance in connection with this analysis discussions have taken place regarding the possible sale of telephone access lines in hawaii and upstate new york however no sale is pending at this time 

  

environmental matters 

  

during 2003 under a governmentapproved plan remediation of the site of a former facility in hicksville new york that processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s commenced remediation beyond original expectations proved to be necessary and a reassessment of the anticipated remediation costs was conducted in addition a reassessment of costs related to remediation efforts at several other former facilities was undertaken as a result an additional environmental remediation expense of 240 million was recorded in selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

new york recovery funding 

  

in august 2002 president bush signed the supplemental appropriations bill which included 55 billion in new york recovery funding of that amount approximately 750 million has been allocated to cover the uninsured losses of businesses including the restoration of utility infrastructure as a result of the september 11th terrorist attacks these funds will be distributed through the lower manhattan development corporation following an application process

revenues telecommunications act of 1996 we face increasing competition in all areas of our business the 1996 act regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints we are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business results of operations or financial condition the financial impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the 1996 act and technological advances inregion long distance we offer long distance service throughout most of the country except in maryland west virginia and the district of columbia where we have not yet received authority to offer long distance service under the 1996 act and in alaska under the 1996 act our ability to offer inregion long distance services in the regions where the former bell atlantic telephone subsidiaries operate as local exchange carriers is largely dependent on satisfying specified requirements the requirements include a 14point “competitive checklist” of steps which we must take to help competitors offer local services through resale through purchase of unbundled network elements unes or by interconnecting their own networks to ours we must also demonstrate to the federal communications commission fcc that our entry into the inregion long distance market would be in the public interest we now have authority to offer inregion long distance service in 11 states in the former bell atlantic territory accounting for approximately 90 of the lines served by the former bell atlantic these states are new york massachusetts connecticut pennsylvania rhode island vermont maine new jersey new hampshire delaware and virginia the pennsylvania and new jersey orders are currently on appeal to the us court of appeals the us court of appeals has remanded the massachusetts order to the fcc for further explanation on one issue but left our long distance authority in effect in december 2002 we filed an application with the fcc for permission to enter the inregion long distance market in maryland west virginia and the district of columbia the fcc must act on this application by march 19 2003 fcc regulation and interstate rates our telephone operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to interstate services and related matters in 2002 the fcc continued to implement reforms to the interstate access charge system and to implement the “universal service” and other requirements of the 1996 act 2   access charges and universal service on may 31 2000 the fcc adopted the coalition for affordable local and long distance services calls plan as a comprehensive fiveyear plan for regulation of interstate access charges the calls plan has three main components first it establishes a portable interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry this explicit support replaces implicit support embedded in interstate access charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the slc by zones and class of customers in a manner that will not undermine comparable and affordable universal service third the plan sets into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of 00055 per minute for switched access services once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices the annual reductions leading to the target rate as well as annual reductions for the subset of special access services that remain subject to price cap regulation was set at 65 per year on september 10 2001 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit ruled on an appeal of the fcc order adopting the plan the court upheld the fcc on several challenges to the order but remanded two aspects of the decision back to the fcc on the grounds that they lacked sufficient justification the court remanded back to the fcc for further consideration its decision setting the annual reduction factor at 65 minus an inflation factor and the size of the new universal service fund at 650 million the entire plan including these elements will continue in effect pending the fcc’s further consideration of its justification of these components as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2002 approximately 98 of our access lines reached the 00055 benchmark the fcc has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met in order to use these rules carriers must forego the ability to take advantage of provisions in the current rules that provide relief in the event earnings fall below prescribed thresholds we have been authorized to remove special access and dedicated transport services from price caps in 36 metropolitan statistical areas msas in the former bell atlantic territory and in 17 additional msas in the former gte territory in addition the fcc has found that in 20 msas we have met the stricter standards to remove special access connections to enduser customers from price caps approximately 55 of special access revenues are now removed from price regulation we also have an application pending that if granted would remove an additional three msas and special access connections to enduser customers in two additional msas from price cap regulation in november 1999 the fcc adopted a new mechanism for providing universal service support to high cost areas served by large local telephone companies this funding mechanism provides additional support for local telephone services in several states served by our telephone operations this system has been supplemented by the new fcc access charge plan described above on july 31 2001 the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit reversed and remanded to the fcc for further proceedings the court concluded that the fcc had failed to adequately explain some aspects of its decision and had failed to address any need for a state universal service mechanism the current universal service mechanism remains in place pending the outcome of any fcc review as a result of these appeals unbundling of network elements in november 1999 the fcc announced its decision setting forth new unbundling requirements eliminating elements that it had previously required to be unbundled limiting the obligation to provide others and adding new elements in addition to the unbundling requirements released in november 1999 the fcc released an order in a separate proceeding in december 1999 requiring incumbent local exchange companies also to unbundle and provide to competitors the higher frequency portion of their local loop this provides competitors with the ability to provision data services on top of incumbent carriers’ voice services in july 2000 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit found that some aspects of the fcc’s requirements for pricing unes were inconsistent with the 1996 act in particular it found that the fcc was wrong to require incumbent carriers to base these prices not on their real costs but on the imaginary costs of the most efficient equipment and the most efficient network configuration this portion of the court’s decision was stayed pending review by the us supreme court on may 13 2002 the us supreme court reversed that decision and upheld the fcc’s pricing rules on may 24 2002 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit released an order that overturned the most recent fcc decision establishing which network elements were required to be unbundled in particular the court found that the fcc did not adequately consider the limitations of the “necessary and impair” standards of the 1996 act when it chose national rules for unbundling and that it failed to consider the relevance of competition from other types of service providers including cable and satellite the court also vacated a separate order that had authorized an unbundling requirement for “line sharing” where a competing carrier purchases only a portion of the copper connection to the enduser in order to provide highspeed broadband services using dsl technology several parties including the fcc petitioned the court for rehearing of the court order the court rejected the petitions that asked it to change its decision on september 4 2002 the court did however stay its order vacating the fcc’s rules until february 20 2003 to provide the fcc time to complete an ongoing rulemaking to determine what elements should be unbundled several carriers have sought us supreme court review of the underlying court decision that request remains pending 3   on october 25 2002 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit released an order upholding the fcc’s decisions that established interim limits on the availability of combinations of unes known as enhanced extended links or “eels” eels consist of unbundled loops and transport elements the fcc decisions limited access to eels to carriers that would use them to provide a significant amount of local traffic and not just use them as substitutes for special access services prior to the issuance of these orders from the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the fcc had already begun a review of the scope of its unbundling requirement through a rulemaking referred to as the triennial review of unes this rulemaking reopens the question of what network elements must be made available on an unbundled basis under the 1996 act and will revisit the unbundling decisions made in the order overturned by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in this rulemaking the fcc also will address other pending issues relating to unbundled elements including the question of whether competing carriers may substitute combinations of unbundled loops and transport for already competitive special access services on february 20 2003 the fcc announced a decision in its triennial review but the order has not yet been released compensation for internet traffic on april 27 2001 the fcc released an order addressing intercarrier compensation for dialup connections for internetbound traffic the fcc found that internetbound traffic is interstate and subject to the fcc’s jurisdiction moreover the fcc again found that internetbound traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the 1996 act instead the fcc established federal rates per minute for this traffic that decline from 00015 to 00007 over a threeyear period the fcc order also sets caps on the total minutes of this traffic that may be subject to any intercarrier compensation and requires that incumbent local exchange carriers must offer to both bill and pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound traffic on may 3 2002 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit rejected part of the fcc’s rationale for its april 27 2001 order but declined to vacate the order while it is on remand several parties requested rehearing asking the court to vacate the underlying order those requests were denied in a series of orders released on september 24 2002 and september 25 2002 one carrier has sought us supreme court review of that denial in the meantime pending further action by the fcc the fcc’s underlying order remains in effect state regulation of rates and services state public utility commissions regulate our telephone operations with respect to intrastate rates and services and other matters in many jurisdictions the telephone operations have been able to replace rate of return regulation with price regulation plans verizon california inc arizona verizon california’s operations in arizona are subject to rate of return regulation california verizon california’s operations in

verizon delaware inc since 1994 verizon delaware has been regulated under the alternative regulation provisions of the delaware telecommunications technology investment act of 1993 delaware telecommunications act the delaware telecommunications act provides the following     in april 2001 the delaware public service commission approved verizon delaware’s request for an extension of the current incentive regulation plan until one year after verizon delaware obtains authority to enter the long distance market or march 2004 whichever occurs first in exchange for the extension verizon delaware agreed to cap basic rates until december 31 2002 on september 24 2002 the fcc granted verizon delaware’s application to enter the long distance market in 2002 verizon delaware advised the delaware public service commission that it elects to remain regulated under the delaware telecommunications act with minor modifications no action on this request has yet been scheduled verizon florida inc florida statutes govern the price cap plan beginning january 1 2001 verizon florida was able to raise basic local rates on 30 days notice once in any 12month period not to exceed the gdppi less 1 verizon florida may increase rates for nonbasic services but increases for any category cannot exceed 6 in any 12month period unless another company is providing service in a given exchange at

increased or decreased annually under a formula that is based upon changes in the gdppi minus a productivity offset based upon changes in the rate of inflation as reflected in the consumer price index cpi rates for competitive services may be increased without regulatory limits regulation of profits is eliminated the public service commission of maryland is currently reviewing the incentive regulation plan verizon maryland has sought to eliminate the price cap formula and to move all business services into the competitive category verizon new england inc maine in june 2001 the maine public utilities commission puc ordered the continuation of an alternative form of regulation afor for verizon maine for a second fiveyear term key aspects of the new plan      5    the maine public advocate appealed the puc’s afor decision to the maine supreme judicial court claiming that any extension to the afor must be preceded by an investigation of verizon maine’s costs and earnings utilizing traditional rate of return principles on february 28 2003 the court ruled that while state law requires that telephone rates under an afor are no higher than under rate of return regulation the puc has broad discretion in making such a determination that would not necessarily require a full rate of return inquiry however the court vacated and remanded the decision to the puc for its failure to expressly make such a determination or in the alternative that if such a showing cannot be made that it nonetheless remains in the best interest of ratepayers to proceed with an afor no change in any of verizon maine’s rates is required by the court’s decision while the remand proceeding is pending massachusetts in april 2001 verizon new england filed with the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte a proposed alternative regulatory plan to replace the price regulation plan that was to expire in august 2001 on may 8 2002 the dte issued its decision in phase i of the case in which it found that verizon new england had demonstrated the existence of sufficient competition for most of its retail business services and granted verizon new england pricing flexibility on the services price increases are not constrained price decreases are subject to price floor requirements in addition the dte ruled that verizon new england should reduce state switched access prices to interstate levels on a revenue neutral basis by increases in residence dial tone rates with respect to residence services the dte tentatively concluded that verizon new england should have pricing flexibility for nonbasic services but that increases in basic services should be limited the dte directed verizon new england to file proposals consistent with its findings these proposals are under review by the dte in phase ii of the case and a decision is pending on july 11 2002 the dte issued a comprehensive order in which it ruled on the cost studies used for setting verizon new england’s prices for unes verizon new england and other parties filed motions for reconsideration of various portions of the order on january 14 2003 the dte issued its ruling on the motions and directed verizon new england to file new cost studies consistent with the rulings within 30 days on december 20 2002 the dte issued its decision in response to a remand by the united states district court for the eastern district of massachusetts in an appeal brought by worldcom inc and global naps inc related to several orders of the dte dating back to may 1999 the court ruled in an august 2002 decision that dte orders finding that reciprocal compensation was not owed on internetbound traffic did not comply with federal law because the dte had not rested its rulings on the specific language of the interconnection agreements in its latest decision the dte ruled that the plain terms of the agreements excluded internetbound traffic from the scope of the reciprocal compensation provisions and therefore verizon new england had no obligation to pay reciprocal compensation on such traffic global naps and worldcom have appealed the dte’s decision to the united states district court for the eastern district of massachusetts new hampshire verizon new england’s operations in new hampshire are currently subject to rate of return regulation rhode island pursuant

competition current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long distance companies other local telephone companies cable companies wireless service providers foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth 10   local exchange services the ability to offer local exchange services has historically been subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every jurisdiction in our service territory the 1996 act has significantly increased the level of competition in our local exchange markets one of the purposes of the 1996 act was to ensure and accelerate the emergence of competition in local exchange markets toward this end the 1996 act requires most existing local exchange carriers incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs including our telephone operations to permit potential competitors clecs to    as a result competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase our telephone operations are generally required to sell their services to clecs at discounts of approximately 51 from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers a number of our state regulators have recently mandated reductions in the rates we charge local exchange competitors for access to unes and others are initiating similar proceedings see “state regulation of rates and services” long distance services we offer intralata and interlata long distance services intralata toll calls originate and terminate within the same lata but generally cover a greater distance than a local call state regulatory commissions rather than federal authorities generally regulate these services federal regulators have jurisdiction over interstate toll services all of our state regulatory commissions except in the district of columbia where intralata toll service is not provided permit other carriers to offer intralata toll services within the state interlata toll calls terminate outside the lata of origination we offer interlata long distance services nationwide except in those regions served by the former bell atlantic telephone operations where we have not yet received authority to offer long distance service under the 1996 act and in alaska a number of our major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition and existing customer relationships alternative access services a substantial portion of our telephone operations’ revenues from business and government customers is derived from a relatively small number of large multipleline subscribers we face competition from alternative communications systems constructed by large endusers interexchange carriers and alternative access vendors which are capable of originating andor terminating calls without the use of our plant the fcc’s orders requiring us to offer collocated interconnection for special and switched access services have enhanced the ability of such alternative access providers to compete with us other potential sources of competition include cable television systems shared tenant services and other noncarrier systems which are capable of bypassing our telephone operations’ local plant either partially or completely through substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of telecommunications traffic on fewer of our telephone operations’ lines wireless services wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to lower their prices to endusers as a result more endusers are substituting wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can also be used for data transmission public telephone services the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers of public telephone services operator services our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator services providers and internet service providers 11   domestic wireless

verizon wireless in exchange for a 651 economic interest in verizon wireless bell atlantic contributed its us wireless operations and its interest in primeco to verizon wireless in july 2000 after the merger of bell atlantic and gte verizon contributed gte’s us wireless operations to verizon wireless increasing verizon’s economic interest in verizon wireless from 349 to 55 verizon wireless brought together the operations of four wellrecognized us wireless carriers bell atlantic mobile gte wireless airtouch and primeco resulting in the formation of the most extensive wireless network in the united states bell atlantic mobile bell atlantic mobile based in bedminster new jersey had 80 million customers as of march 31 2000 it operated in 18 states and the district of columbia and 12 of the

contribution to the partnership primeco was a partnership between bell atlantic and vodafone based in westlake texas primeco operated in nine states and 13 of the top 50 united states markets including dallas miami san antonio and tampa the preceding customer numbers include overlapping markets that have been subsequently sold recent acquisition price communications in december 2001 verizon wireless and price communications corp price announced that an agreement had been reached to combine price’s wireless business with a portion of verizon wireless in a transaction valued at approximately 17 billion including 550 million of net debt the transaction closed on august 15 2002 and the assumed debt was redeemed on august 16 2002 the resulting limited partnership is controlled and managed by verizon wireless in exchange for its contributed assets price received a limited partnership interest in the new 12   partnership which is exchangeable into common stock of verizon wireless if an initial public offering of that stock occurs or into the common stock of verizon on the fourth anniversary of the asset contribution date if the initial public offering of verizon wireless common stock does not occur prior to then the price of the verizon common stock used in determining the number of verizon common shares received in an exchange is also subject to a maximum and minimum amount competition there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry we expect competition to intensify as a result of the consolidation of the industry the entry of new competitors the development of new technologies products and services the auction of additional spectrum and regulatory changes other wireless providers serve each of the markets in which we compete we currently provide service to 49 of the top 50 markets in the us and these 49 markets have an average of five other competing wireless providers competition also may increase to the extent that smaller standalone wireless providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced wireless providers we compete against five other national wireless service providers att wireless cingular wireless nextel communications sprint pcs and tmobile formerly voicestream in addition we compete against several regional wireless companies in markets where we provide service additional competitors are seeking to enter the market using new types of spectrum the wireless communications industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and this trend may continue this consolidation trend could enhance the ability of wireless service providers with substantial financial technical marketing and other resources to compete with our offerings we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry brand recognition we introduced the verizon wireless brand name in april 2000 and believe that we have developed strong brand recognition network coverage in recent years competition in our industry has led to lower prices and to the popularity of pricing plans that do not charge for roaming as a result the ability to offer national coverage through a company’s own network is important including the ability to ensure uniform performance and the availability of features throughout the country as many features are not fully available through roaming partners digital service and technology digital service offers benefits to the customer and also permits a network to have greater capacity customer service quality customer service and care is essential to ensure that existing customers do not terminate service and to obtain new customers capital resources in order to expand and buildout networks and introduce next generation services wireless providers require significant capital resources as a result of competition we may encounter further market pressures to reduce our service prices restructure our service packages to offer more value or respond to particular shortterm marketspecific situations for example special introductory pricing or packages that may be offered by new providers launching their service in a particular market this may result in increased advertising and promotional spending to respond to competition our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our marketing efforts and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry including the factors described above new services and technologies changes in consumer preferences demographic trends economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors international

telecommunications act of 1996

we face increasing competition in all areas of our business the 1996 act
regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies
products and services have created opportunities for alternative
telecommunication service providers many of which are subject to fewer
regulatory constraints we are unable to predict definitively the impact that
the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on
our business results of operations or financial condition the financial
impact will depend on several factors including the timing extent and success
of competition in our markets the timing and outcome of various regulatory
proceedings and any appeals and the timing extent and success of our pursuit
of new opportunities resulting from the 1996 act and technological advances

inregion long distance

we offer long distance service nationwide except in those states served by the
former bell atlantic telephone operations where we have not yet received
authority to offer long distance service under the 1996 act under the 1996 act
our ability to offer inregion long distance services in the states where the
former bell atlantic telephone subsidiaries operate as local exchange carriers
is largely dependent on satisfying specified requirements the requirements
include a 14point competitive checklist of steps which we must take to help
competitors offer local services through resale through purchase of unbundled
network elements or by interconnecting their own networks to ours we must also
demonstrate to the federal communications commission fcc that our entry into
the inregion long distance market would be in the public interest

we now have authority to offer inregion long distance service in five states in
the former bell atlantic territory accounting for more than half of the lines
served by the former bell atlantic in addition to its new york order released
in december 1999 the fcc released orders on april 16 2001 july 23 2001
september 19 2001 and february 22 2002 approving our applications for
permission to enter the inregion long distance market in massachusetts
connecticut pennsylvania and rhode island respectively both the massachusetts
and pennsylvania orders are currently on appeal to the us court of appeals

we have filed applications with the fcc to offer long distance service in new
jersey and vermont we expect the fcc to rule on those applications by march 20
2002 and april 17 2002 respectively we have also filed state applications for
support of anticipated applications with the fcc for permission to enter the
inregion long distance market in new hampshire delaware and maine thirdparty
testing of our operations support systems is in its final stages in virginia
west virginia maryland and the district of columbia

fcc regulation and interstate rates

our telephone operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect
to interstate services and related matters in 2001 the fcc continued to
implement reforms to the interstate access charge system and to implement the
universal service and other requirements of the 1996 act

access charges and universal service

on may 31 2000 the fcc adopted a plan advanced by members of the industry the
coalition for affordable local and long distance services or calls as a
comprehensive fiveyear plan for regulation of interstate access charges the
calls plan has three main components first it establishes a portable
interstate access universal service support of 650 million for the industry
this explicit support replaces implicit support embedded in interstate access
charges second the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into
one subscriber line charge slc and provides for deaveraging of the slc by
zones and class of customers in a manner that will not undermine comparable and
affordable universal service third the plan sets into place a mechanism to
transition to a set target of 0055 per minute for switched access services
once that target rate is reached local exchange carriers are no longer required
to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices the
annual reductions leading to the target rate as well as annual reductions for
the subset of special access services that remain subject to price cap
regulation was set at 65 per year

on september 10 2001 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit ruled on
an appeal of the fcc order adopting the plan the court upheld the fcc on
several challenges to the order but remanded two aspects of the decision back
to the fcc on the grounds that they lacked sufficient justification the court
remanded back to the fcc for further consideration its decision setting the
annual reduction factor at 65 and the size of the new universal service fund
at 650 million the entire plan including these elements will continue in
effect pending the fccs further consideration of its justification of these
components

as a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in july 2001
approximately 80 of our access lines reached the 00055 benchmark

the fcc has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing
flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when
prescribed competitive thresholds are met in order to use these rules carriers
must forego the ability to take advantage of provisions in the current rules
that provide relief in the event earnings fall below prescribed thresholds in
2001 we were authorized to remove special access and dedicated transport
services from price caps in 35 of the 57 metropolitan statistical areas msas
in the former bell atlantic territory and in three additional msas in the former
gte territory in addition the fcc found that in 10 msas we have met the
stricter standards to remove special access connections to enduser customers
from price caps we have an application pending that if granted would remove
special access services from price cap regulation in 16 additional msas

in november 1999 the fcc adopted a new mechanism for providing universal
service support to high cost areas served by large local telephone companies
this funding mechanism provides additional support for local telephone services
in several states served by our telephone operations this system has been
supplemented by the new fcc access charge plan described above on july 31
2001 the us court of appeals for the tenth circuit reversed and remanded to
the fcc for further proceedings the court concluded that the fcc had failed to
adequately explain some aspects of its decision and had failed to address any
need for a state universal service mechanism the current universal service
mechanism remains in place pending the outcome of any fcc review as a result of
these appeals

unbundling of network elements unes

in november 1999 the fcc announced its decision setting forth new unbundling
requirements eliminating elements that it had previously required to be
unbundled limiting the obligation to provide others and adding new elements
appeals from this decision are pending

in addition to the unbundling requirements released in november 1999 the fcc
released an order in a separate proceeding in december 1999 requiring incumbent
local exchange companies also to unbundle and provide to competitors the higher
frequency portion of their local loop this provides competitors with the
ability to provision data services on top of incumbent carriers voice services
appeals from this order are also pending

in july 2000 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit found that some
aspects of the fccs requirements for pricing unes were inconsistent with the
1996 act in particular it found that the fcc was wrong to require incumbent
carriers to base these prices not on their real costs but on the imaginary costs
of the most efficient equipment and the most efficient network configuration
this portion of the courts decision has been stayed pending review by the us
supreme court in addition the court upheld the fccs decision that unes should
be priced based on a forwardlooking cost model rather than historical costs
the us supreme court currently has this case under review

in december 2001 the fcc opened its triennial review of unes this rulemaking
reopens the question of what network elements must be made available on an
unbundled basis under the 1996 act and will revisit the unbundling decisions
described above in this rulemaking the fcc also will address other pending
issues relating to unbundled elements including the question of whether
competing carriers may substitute combinations of unbundled loops and transport
for already competitive special access services

compensation for internet traffic

on april 27 2001 the fcc released an order addressing intercarrier
compensation for dialup connections for internetbound traffic the fcc found
that internetbound traffic is interstate and subject to the fccs jurisdiction
moreover the fcc again found that internetbound traffic is not subject to
reciprocal compensation under section 251b5 of the 1996 act instead the
fcc established federal rates for this traffic that decline from 00015 to
00007 over a threeyear period the fcc order also sets caps on the total
minutes of this traffic that may be subject to any intercarrier compensation and
requires that incumbent local exchange carriers must offer to pay reciprocal
compensation for

                                       3
page

local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on internetbound
traffic several competing carriers and state regulators appealed this order to
the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the court denied a motion to
stay the fcc order and the order went into effect the appeal remains pending

state regulation of rates and services

other telephone operations

our missouri statutory price cap plan started in february 1999 under the plan
we can rebalance rates in the first four years of the plan by increasing local
rates by 150 and reducing switched access by an equivalent amount toll rates
must be reduced by 10 in the first year nonbasic service rates may increase
by 8 annually earnings are not regulated

competition

current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long
distance companies other local telephone companies cable companies wireless
service providers foreign telecommunications providers electric utilities
internet service providers and other companies that offer network services many
of these companies have a strong market presence brand recognition and existing
customer relationships all of which contribute to intensifying competition and
may affect our future revenue growth

local exchange services

the ability to offer local exchange services has historically been subject to
regulation by state regulatory commissions applications from competitors to
provide and resell local exchange services have been approved in every
jurisdiction in our service territory the 1996 act has significantly increased
the level of competition in our local exchange markets

one of the purposes of the 1996 act was to ensure and accelerate the emergence
of competition in local exchange markets toward this end the 1996 act requires
most existing local exchange carriers incumbent local exchange carriers or
ilecs including our telephone operations to permit potential competitors
clecs to

     purchase service from the ilec for resale to clec customers

     purchase unes from the ilec andor

     interconnect the clecs network with the ilecs network

as a result competition in our local exchange markets continues to increase
our telephone operations are generally required to sell their services to clecs
at discounts of approximately 38 from the prices our telephone operations
charge their retail customers our state regulators in new york and new jersey
have recently mandated reductions in the rates we charge local exchange
competitors for access to unes a number of other state regulators are
initiating similar proceedings see state regulation of rates and services

long distance services

we offer intralata and interlata long distance services intralata toll calls
originate and terminate within the same lata but generally cover a greater
distance than a local call state regulatory commissions rather than federal
authorities generally regulate these services federal regulators have
jurisdiction over interstate toll services all of our state regulatory
commissions except in the district of columbia where intralata toll service is
not provided permit other carriers to offer intralata toll services within the
state interlata toll calls terminate outside the lata of origination we offer
interlata long distance services nationwide except in those states served by
the former bell atlantic telephone operations where we have not yet received
authority to offer long distance service under the 1996 act a number of our
major competitors in the long distance business have strong brand recognition
and existing customer relationships

alternative access services

a substantial portion of our telephone operations revenues from business and
government customers is derived from a relatively small number of large
multipleline subscribers

we face competition from alternative communications systems constructed by
large endusers interexchange carriers and alternative access vendors which
are capable of originating andor terminating calls without the use of our
plant the fccs orders requiring us to offer collocated interconnection for
special and switched access services have enhanced the ability of such
alternative access providers to compete with us

                                       9
page

other potential sources of competition include cable television systems shared
tenant services and other noncarrier systems which are capable of bypassing our
telephone operations local plant either partially or completely through
substitution of special access for switched access or through concentration of
telecommunications traffic on fewer of our telephone operations lines

wireless services

wireless services also constitute a significant source of competition to our
wireline telecommunications services especially as wireless carriers including
verizon wireless expand and improve their network coverage and continue to
lower their prices to endusers as a result more end users are substituting
wireless services for basic wireline service wireless telephone services can
also be used for data transmission

public telephone services

the growth of wireless communications has significantly decreased usage of
public telephones as more customers are substituting wireless services for
public telephone services in addition we face competition from other providers
of public telephone services

operator services

our operator services product line faces competition from alternative operator
services providers and internet service providers


domestic wireless


operations

our domestic wireless segment provides wireless voice and data services paging
services and equipment sales in the united states principally through verizon
wireless

verizon wireless is the leading wireless communications provider in the united
states in terms of the number of subscribers network coverage revenues and

city

wireless licenses are granted by the fcc for an initial 10year term and are
renewable for successive 10year terms to date all verizon wireless and
predecessor company see following formation discussion wireless licenses have
been successfully renewed

in september 1999 bell atlantic and vodafone group plc agreed to combine their
us wireless telecommunication businesses and form verizon wireless in april
2000 vodafone contributed us wireless operations airtouch and its interest
in primeco communications to verizon wireless in exchange for a 651 economic
interest in verizon wireless bell atlantic contributed its us wireless
operations and its interest in primeco to verizon wireless in july 2000 after
the merger of bell atlantic and gte verizon contributed gtes us wireless
operations to verizon wireless increasing verizons economic interest in
verizon wireless from 349 to 55

verizon wireless brought together the operations of four wellrecognized us
wireless carriers bell atlantic mobile gte wireless airtouch and primeco
resulting in the formation of the most extensive wireless network in the united
states

bell atlantic mobile

bell atlantic mobile based in bedminster new jersey had 80 million customers
as of march 31 2000 it operated in 18 states and the district of columbia and
12 of the top 50 us markets including baltimore boston new york city

prior to its contribution to the partnership primeco was a partnership between
bell atlantic and vodafone based in westlake texas primeco operated in nine
states and 13 of the top 50 united states markets including dallas miami san

price communications

in december 2001 verizon wireless and price communications corporation agreed
to combine the business operations of price communications wireless inc and a
portion of verizon wireless in a transaction valued at 17 billion including
550 million in net debt that will be assumed or redeemed under the terms of
the transaction which replaces an agreement announced by the companies in
november 2000 price communications wireless and verizon wireless will form a
limited partnership consisting of substantially all of the assets of price
communications wireless operations and some of verizon wirelesss assets
verizon wireless will control and manage the partnership price communications
partnership interest will be exchangeable into verizon wireless or verizon
stock subject to several conditions the transaction which remains subject to
the approval of price communications shareholders and other customary closing
conditions will significantly expand the companys footprint in the
southeastern us and add approximately 560000 customers

dobsons wireless operations

in november and december 2001 we announced that verizon wireless signed
definitive agreements to acquire several of dobson communications corporations
dobson wireless operations in california georgia ohio tennessee and
arizona the transactions closed in february 2002 the acquired dobson
properties serve a population of approximately 12 million

competition

there is substantial competition in the wireless telecommunications industry we
expect competition to intensify as a result of the consolidation of the
industry the entry of new competitors the development of new technologies
products and services the auction of additional spectrum and regulatory
changes other wireless providers serve each of the markets in which we compete
we currently provide service to 49 of the top 50 markets in the us and these
49 markets have an average of five other competing wireless providers
competition also may increase to the extent that smaller standalone wireless
providers transfer licenses to larger better capitalized and more experienced
wireless providers

we compete against five other national wireless service providers att
wireless cingular wireless nextel communications inc sprint pcs and
voicestream in addition we compete against several regional wireless companies
in markets where we provide service additional competitors are seeking to enter
the market using new types of spectrum the wireless communications industry has
been experiencing consolidation and we expect that this trend will continue
this consolidation trend may enhance the ability of wireless service providers
with substantial financial technical marketing and other resources to compete
with our offerings

we believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our
industry

brand recognition  we introduced the verizon wireless brand name in april 2000

and believe that we have developed strong brand recognition

network coverage in recent years competition in our industry has led to lower

prices and to the popularity of pricing plans that do not charge for roaming as
a result the ability to offer national coverage through a companys own network
is important including the ability to ensure uniform performance and the
availability of features throughout the country as many features are not fully
available through roaming partners

digital service and technology  digital service offers benefits to the customer

and also permits a network to have greater capacity

customer service  quality customer service and care is essential to ensure

that existing customers do not terminate service and to obtain new customers

capital resources  in order to expand and buildout networks and introduce

next generation services wireless providers require significant capital
resources

as a result of competition we may encounter further market pressures to reduce
our service prices restructure our service packages to offer more value or
respond to particular shortterm marketspecific situations for example
special introductory pricing or packages that may be offered by new providers
launching their service in a particular market we also expect to increase our
advertising and promotional spending to respond to competition

our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our marketing efforts
and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors
affecting the industry including the factors described above new services and
technologies changes in consumer preferences demographic trends economic
conditions and pricing strategies by competitors

international regulatory and competitive trends

for several years the telecommunications industry has been experiencing dynamic
changes as national and international regulatory reforms embrace competition
this opportunity provided by the global market liberalization has allowed us to
expand our international operations across the americas europe asia and the

in the americas the degree of liberalization varies widely among countries in
argentina cti operates in a highly competitive marketplace argentinas
wireless telecommunications industry was previously subject to substantial
government regulation in a competitive environment deregulation of the industry
started in october 1999 and was completed in november 2000

in venezuela cantvs wireless operations have faced competition for several
years in late 2000 the government opened the basic telephony market for local
national and international long distance service to competition and issued new
guidelines governing interconnection and the use of wireless spectrum cantv
however continues to be venezuelas principal telecommunications provider

in the dominican republic codetel faces both wireline and wireless competitors
while the competition has slowed both access line and wireless subscriber
growth codetel remains the principal provider of local national and
international long distance wireless and internet services

the mexican wireless and long distance markets each have several significant
competitors during 2001 iusacell made progress towards its goal of achieving a
national wireless operating footprint with its fourth quarter acquisition of
grupo portatel sa de cv a wireless service provider in southern mexico
and launch of wireless services in northeastern and northwestern mexico with
respect to regulatory matters mexicos legal system continues to be unable to
implement or enforce effective dominant carrier regulation against telefonos de
mexico sa de cv telmex the dominant local wireline and long distance
carrier and radiomovil dipsa sa de cv telcel the dominant wireless
provider for example in november 2001 telmex and telcel chose not to
implement a new national numbering plan placing iusacell and other complying
carriers at a competitive disadvantage to date the mexican ministry of
communications and transport has chosen not to impose any sanctions against
either carrier

in puerto rico five other facilitiesbased providers operate in the wireless
market all wireline services including local long distance internet access
and data have also experienced new competition nevertheless telpri continues
to be the principal provider of telecommunications services in puerto rico to
both the business and consumer markets with respect to regulatory matters the
puerto rico telecommunications regulatory board recently issued an order
requiring substantial reductions in access rates for intraisland long distance
service
