marketing and leasing 

our associates are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish and manage rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including an exclusive period on our proprietary website internet listing services such as zillow trulia hotpads and realtorcom mls yard signs search engine marketing social and other digital media and local brokers we offer flexible showing options for convenience including virtual tours and floor plans on our website selfshowings that leverage the home’s smart home technology and inperson showings we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and primarily utilize inmarket leasing experience specialists to drive a better endtoend resident experience that achieves our occupancy revenue and retention goals while facilitating enjoyment of our worryfree leasing lifestyle 

prospective residents may submit an application through the application portal on our website to maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements we utilize standardized online applications national lease agreements movein and moveout documents resident communications and other ancillary documents we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity although we require a minimum income to rent ratio many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process including eviction history criminal history and rental and other payment history 

our disciplined investment strategy and local inmarket approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods enabling us to execute costeffective advertising targeting potential residents whose online behaviors indicate interest in these neighborhoods we believe this approach increases our likelihood of capturing and retaining residents and enhances our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services 

digital marketing initiatives and branding 

we encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website blog and social media accounts with articles home maintenance advice contests and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes for example we alert our residents to prepare for storms incentivize them to pay their rent online offer “lease friendly” and “make it home” design tips and contests and hold an annual resident appreciation day resident engagement and social following continue to grow and we receive positive feedback from residents who specifically mention our approachable lifestyle and home maintenance content that helps them make a house a home 

resident relations and property maintenance 

the associates in each of our markets are responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations in coordination with a third party vendor we offer a 247 emergency telephone line to handle afterhours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed and our residents can also contact us through our online mobile app our resident portal our call centers or our local property management offices as part of our ongoing property management process we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner as appropriate by appointment at the resident’s convenience we seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize longterm rental income and cash flows from our portfolio 

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance associates in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing heating ventilation and air conditioning “hvac” systems plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners we strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our inhouse maintenance technicians in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance associates provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse maintenance associates conduct periodic procare visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventive maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations we temporarily paused a portion of these visits as a result of the covid19 pandemic but began reinstating procare proactive visits during 2021 

procare service our property management service platform includes several touchpoints over the term of a resident’s lease designed to enhance their satisfaction with our service model improve the efficiency of our service and our homes’ systems and ensure that each resident is properly educated regarding the home and their responsibilities when a new resident moves into one of our homes our associates conduct a resident orientation occasionally virtual due to the ongoing pandemic during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post movein maintenance visit following the movein orientation each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items at the time of the post movein maintenance visit approximately 45 days after movein our inhouse property maintenance associates will address any nonemergency service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance associates finally the post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance associates in each of our markets conduct preventive maintenance visits about every six months during the life of a resident’s stay in the home during preventive maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance associates inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and carbon monoxide detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct premoveout visits 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these visits allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these visits allow our inhouse property maintenance associates to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these visits also improve our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance associates are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance associates to assess and document interior and exterior conditions and whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed if a deficiency is identified by our inhouse property maintenance associates we endeavor to take prompt action to correct it 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select and on an ongoing basis evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 16 markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base that will experience robust longterm demand and that will benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze numerous factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools and transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria as part of our selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired we thus have a substantial proprietary database from which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local market real estate brokers and others and we leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated associates located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals ensure the following are evaluated the structural needs and major systems of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of the home’s fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental occupancy or turnover rates 

we are able to drive cost efficiencies through local oversight of the entire process of renovating our homes by our associates each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing both time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages approximately 5000 homes per market as of december 31 2021 allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale

to ensure consistent attention and focus on esg matters we have created a dedicated crossfunctional esg task force of associates led by executive management as a part of their role as stewards of our company’s longterm performance our board of directors plays a critical role in understanding how esg issues affect our business strategy and performance and provides oversight with respect to our esg initiatives and policies this responsibility is assigned to the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors the nominating and corporate governance committee works closely with management and regularly meets with and reports to the board of directors on our esg strategy initiatives and policies we also believe in the value of feedback and we hold ourselves accountable to that end we participate in the gresb real estate assessment for a thirdparty evaluation of our esg performance and we have linked this performance to the pricing of our revolving credit facility whereby improvements in our gresb score over time can benefit our borrowing costs under the facility in 2021 we achieved a 13 improvement in our sustainability score with gresb surpassing the 5 hurdle set forth in our credit facility agreement for achievement of the pricing benefit 

through our integrated and ongoing approach to sustainability and corporate responsibility we seek to drive positive change and create value for our stakeholders our guiding social responsibility business and workplace policies apply to our directors officers associates and vendors and they are posted on our website these policies apply to all activities undertaken by or on behalf of invitation homes anywhere we operate among other things these policies encompass areas of community and associate engagement diversity equity and inclusion “dei” human rights corporate governance and ethics and environmental initiatives that reflect existing and emerging standards of corporate social responsibility

risk management 

our board of directors and management believe that effective risk management involves our entire corporate governance framework both the board of directors and management have key responsibilities in managing risk throughout the company our board of directors provides overall risk oversight both directly and through its committees to help management identify and assess the major risks our company faces and to develop policies and procedures for monitoring and controlling such risks management is responsible for the daytoday management of risk including implementation of appropriate risk management strategies and integration of risk management into our decisionmaking process members of the board of directors regularly meet with members of management and other key associates who advise the directors on areas of enterprise risk risk mitigation response strategies and any incidents that have arisen 

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic including those relating to the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties we believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team with the strategic counsel and stewardship of our board of directors allow us to effectively monitor manage and ultimately mitigate these risks 

we seek to maximize revenue collections through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing an online resident payment portal which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the electronic collection of a majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month 

our operations are also highly dependent upon information systems that support our business processes cyber intrusions could seriously compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen in the face of everchanging and increasing cyber threats our board of directors is wellpositioned to guide management in the development of an effective cybersecurity risk program for our company the board of directors or its audit committee typically meets no less often than semiannually with senior information technology associates to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and reviews our strategy to defend our business systems and information against cyber attacks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business and results of operations as such we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business including operating investment management and capital markets activities and will continue to actively manage our response in collaboration with our residents and business partners the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our operations depends on ongoing developments which remain highly uncertain including the scope duration and severity of covid19 and its variants the availability distribution and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic drugs and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic containment measures monetary andor fiscal policies implemented to provide support or relief to businesses andor residents and other government regulatory andor legislative measures for more information on risks related to covid19 see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our business and industry — our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ”

insurance 

we maintain property casualty and corporatelevel insurance coverage related to our business including general liability business auto umbrella commercial crime directors’ and officers’ liability fiduciary liability cyber liability employment practices liability and workers’ compensation insurance we believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and industry practice however our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions and we are selfinsured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our business and industry — we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance ” 

systems and technology 

effective systems and technology are essential components of our business to ensure scalability to accommodate continued growth in our portfolio of singlefamily homes for lease we have made significant investments in the lease management construction management property and corporate accounting and asset management systems used to operate our business in addition to vigilant oversight over our core platform we are now focused on advancing cloudbased digital technologies for both our residents and our associates our website is fully integrated into our resident accounting and leasing system from our website which is accessible from mobile devices prospective residents can browse homes available for lease take virtual tours request additional information and apply to lease a specific home through online resident portals and native mobile applications existing residents can set up automatic payments and request maintenance service our associates can support and manage resident requests for critical functions such as leasing and maintenance through easytouse digital tools our system is designed to handle the accounting requirements of residential property accounting including accounting for security deposits and payment of propertylevel expenses the system also interfaces with our third party resident screening vendor partner to expedite evaluations of prospective residents’ rental applications we have worked with a search engine optimization firm to ensure we place high in search engine results and will continue to monitor our placement on search engines in addition sponsored key words are generally purchased in selected markets as needed

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring and leasing our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other reits that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs and costs to reresident during the summer season

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations moreover many risk factors set forth in this annual report on form 10k have been heightened as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate in many cases heightened as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 

• adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation rising interest rates slower growth or recession 

• changes in national regional or local economic demographic or real estate market conditions 

• changes in job markets and employment levels on a national regional and local basis 

• declines in the value of residential real estate 

• overall conditions in the housing market including 

• macroeconomic shifts in demand for rental homes 

• inability to lease or release homes to residents on a timely basis on attractive terms or at all 

• failure of residents to pay rent when due or otherwise perform their lease obligations 

• unanticipated repairs capital expenditures weather related damages or other costs 

• uninsured damages and 

• increases in property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs 

• level of competition for suitable rental homes 

• terms and conditions of purchase contracts 

• costs and time period required to convert acquisitions to rental homes 

• changes in the terms or availability of financing that may render the acquisition of any homes difficult or unattractive 

• the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

• changes in laws including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates see “— tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability ” 

• the impact of potential reforms relating to governmentsponsored enterprises involved in the home finance and mortgage markets 

• rules regulations andor policy initiatives by government and private actors including hoas to discourage or restrict the purchase or operation of singlefamily properties by entities owned or controlled by institutional investors 

• the potential effects of climate change related regulatory policies andor investor responses and expectations and the transition to a lowercarbon economy 

• disputes and potential negative publicity in connection with eviction proceedings 

• construction of new supply 

• costs resulting from the cleanup of and liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems such as indoor mold 

• fraud by borrowers originators andor sellers of mortgage loans 

• undetected deficiencies andor inaccuracies in underlying mortgage loan documentation and calculations 

• casualty or condemnation losses 

• the geographic mix of our properties 

• the cost quality and condition of the properties we are able to acquire and 

• our ability to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance 

any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

a significant outbreak of infectious disease or a pandemic may result in a widespread health crisis which has been the case for the currently ongoing covid19 pandemic and may lead to an economic downturn that could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition to the extent our current or prospective residents experience unemployment deteriorating financial conditions and declines in household income they may be unwilling or unable to pay rent in full on a timely basis or renew or enter into new leases for our homes and our revenues and operating results could be negatively affected 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak in the united states has led entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as certain states counties and cities including those in which we own properties and where our principal places of business are located to impose ongoing measures in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents deferral of missed rent payments without incurring late fees and restrictions on rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to collect and increase rents while such measures are likely to enable residents to stay in their homes despite an inability to pay because of financial or other hardship stemming from the pandemic they restrict our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for failure to pay rent and are likely to result in loss of rental income and other property income we continue to work with residents experiencing financial hardship to find solutions that keep them in their homes this includes continuing to provide residents with information about rental assistance programs for which they may be eligible application instructions necessary documentation and owner requirements we cannot predict if states municipalities local andor national authorities will renew extend or expand existing restrictions if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire we also cannot predict if the federal government states or local authorities will continue to offer rental assistance programs to residents and landlords or if such programs will be available to our residents and if they are available whether residents will take advantage of them 

our residents’ inability or refusal to meet their lease obligations has reduced and may continue to reduce our cash flows and the resulting impact on rental and other property income could impact our ability to make all required debt service payments and to continue paying dividends to our stockholders at expected levels or at all 

additionally prolonged impact of the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures may also continue to interfere with the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks or supply materials products services or funding in the case of our revolving credit facility at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business the pandemic has also exacerbated many of the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 

a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions resulting from the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could adversely affect 1 our ability to acquire or dispose of singlefamily homes on terms that are attractive or at all and 2 the value of our homes and our business such that we may recognize impairment on the carrying value of our investments in singlefamily residential properties and other assets subject to impairment review including but not limited to goodwill 

an economic downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic and a disruption of andor instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations including acquisitions or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis 

our associates continue to face covid19 health risks if a significant number of our associates or if key personnel are unable to work as a result of covid19 or a future pandemic this could adversely impact our business and operating results in addition extended periods of remote work arrangements resulting from outbreaks of infectious disease could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business 

in addition we are experiencing disruptions from workforce turnover due to a scarcity of talent as businesses emerging from the pandemic compete for personnel and rising labor costs many of our positions require specialized skill sets resulting in a longer than average time period to fill vacant positions a sustained labor shortage or increased employee turnover rate caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs and increased wage rates to attract and retain associates labor shortages and absenteeism associated with covid19 may also continue to interfere with the ability of our associates to carry out their assigned tasks in a timely manner 

we are closely tracking developments regarding federal state or local vaccine mandates and testing requirements although we cannot predict with certainty the impact that any potential vaccine mandates and any other related measures may have on our workforce and operations potential vaccine mandates’ compliance may result in increased operating costs loss of productivity labor disruptions or associate attrition 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our operations depends on ongoing developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope duration and severity of covid19 and the proliferation of variants the extent and duration of actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact the availability distribution acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic drugs the implementation of any federal state or local vaccine mandates and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic containment measures monetary andor fiscal policies implemented to provide support or relief to businesses andor residents and other government regulatory andor legislative changes precipitated by the covid19 pandemic among others 

nevertheless the covid19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business was comprised primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly 

we have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

• our ability to effectively manage renovation maintenance marketing and other operating costs for our properties 

• economic conditions in our markets including changes in employment and household earnings and expenses as well as the condition of the financial and real estate markets and the economy in general 

• our ability to maintain high occupancy rates and target rent levels 

• the availability of and our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment strategy 

• our ability to compete with other investors entering the singlefamily rental industry 

• costs that are beyond our control including title litigation litigation with residents or tenant organizations legal compliance property taxes hoa fees and insurance 

• judicial and regulatory developments affecting landlordtenant relations that may affect or delay our ability to dispossess or evict occupants or increase rental rates 

• reversal of population employment or homeownership trends in our markets and 

• interest rate levels and volatility which may affect the accessibility of shortterm and longterm financing on desirable terms 

in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of over 80000 homes as of december 31 2021 our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 

• stabilize and manage an increasing number of properties and resident relationships across our geographically dispersed portfolio while maintaining a high level of resident satisfaction and building and enhancing our brand 

• identify and supervise a number of suitable third parties on which we rely to provide certain services outside of property management to our properties 

• attract integrate and retain new management and operations associates and 

• continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting procedures and systems 

we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as property taxes hoa fees insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results 

inflation which increased significantly during 2021 has adversely affected us by increasing the costs of products materials and labor needed to operate our business and could continue to adversely affect us in future periods in an inflationary environment we may not be able to raise rents sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation actions by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation which may have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

we recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we recorded consolidated net losses for the year ended december 31 2018 these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may record net losses in future periods 

we are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated associates and the departure of any of our key associates could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational associates additionally our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages turnover and labor cost increases 

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management associates or our inability to recruit and retain qualified associates in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified associates competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational associates is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining associates and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled associates if we are unable to hire and retain qualified associates as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics and changes in employment legislation high unemployment levels and federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic may have adversely affected the labor force available to us or increased labor costs we are also experiencing and may continue to experience additional pressure due to labor shortages and absenteeism associated with covid19 together with the impact of the continued elevated demand if we are unable to retain qualified associates or our labor costs increase significantly our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if an economic downturn in these markets occurs or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to renovate extensively we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits delays in receiving materials 

fixtures or appliances certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship we have seen a prolonged impact from the pandemic on our industry and business affecting the ability of our associates suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks provide services or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business due to labor shortages and supply chain disruptions among other challenges in addition we are experiencing disruptions from workforce turnover affecting the renovation and maintenance of our properties as businesses emerging from the pandemic compete for personnel many of our positions require specialized skill sets resulting in a longer than average time period to fill position vacancies if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our singlefamily properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

• improvements in the overall economy and employment levels 

• greater availability of consumer credit 

• improvements in the pricing and terms of mortgages 

• the emergence of increased competition for singlefamily properties from private investors and entities with similar investment objectives to ours and 

• tax or other government incentives that encourage homeownership 

a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability to acquire or dispose of singlefamily homes on terms that are attractive or at all 

we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and smallscale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including affordability covenants permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions renovations or dispositions result in significant costs delays or losses and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations additionally state and local agencies may place affordability covenants on certain properties to ensure that they are used to provide affordable housing for persons or families of lower income if any of our properties contain affordability covenants recorded in their chains of title we will be forced to sell such properties at a maximum price limit as calculated per the applicable affordable housing covenant which will likely result in us having to sell such properties below their market values our properties are also subject to federal state and local accessibility requirements including and in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing act 

any violation by us of the laws and regulations we are subject to could lead to significant fines or penalties and could limit our ability to conduct business we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions renovations or dispositions or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs or losses our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability 

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown rent control initiatives can amass significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

for example in 2019 the state of california passed the tenant protection act of 2019 a rent control law which limits our ability to increase rental rates for existing residents and put into place protections for the terminations of tenancies we believe this law negatively affects our rental income from certain of the 12280 homes we own in california as of december 31 2021 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak in the united states has led entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as certain states counties and cities including those in which we own properties and where our principal places of business are located to impose ongoing measures in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents deferral of missed rent payments without incurring late fees and restrictions on rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to collect and increase rents while such measures are likely to enable residents to stay in their homes despite an inability to pay because of financial or other hardship stemming from the pandemic they restrict our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for failure to pay rent and are likely to result in loss of rental income and other property income we cannot predict if states municipalities local andor national authorities will renew extend or expand existing restrictions if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” 

we may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosurerelated issues and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership some of these organizations may shift their litigation lobbying fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlordresident issues while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our business is subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters such as privacy data protection personal information rights of publicity content marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection and online payment services these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently additionally as we depend on third parties for key services see “— our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform ” we rely on such third party service providers’ compliance with laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters relating to our customers 

there are a number of legislative proposals at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business we are subject to numerous complex and frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information various federal and state privacy and data security laws such as the california consumer privacy act and nevada privacy law or other regulatory standards create data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we also make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as hvac roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing 

and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

an overall labor shortage experienced by our vendors lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results we have entered into a multiyear contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale accordingly the inability or unwillingness of this vendor to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer 

we rely on the systems of our third party service providers their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified associates to perform our work a failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified associates could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers may reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer in the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance if an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly may not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and title insurance protection may not be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss 

title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions and acquisitions through an auction process 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in bulk or through an auction process we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties if at all such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates the costs involved in locating and performing due diligence when feasible on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable in addition a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio 

bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than singlefamily home acquisitions and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully with respect to auction process acquisitions allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home 

moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and lease such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

our strategy to acquire homes from third party homebuilders could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

we recently began and expect to continue entering into contracts with homebuilder counterparties for the acquisition of new homes pursuant to these contracts which are generally entered into in a single negotiated transaction homes will be delivered to us pursuant to a negotiated delivery schedule we have made commitments for future fundings and there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us for such purposes 

this strategy depends on the performance of our counterparties we rely on builder counterparties to acquire land suitable for residential building in our markets and to deliver quality homes at reasonable prices in a timely manner in accordance with agreed to specifications a failure of builder counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of our 

agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business further poor performance by homebuilder counterparties may reflect poorly on us and could damage our reputation 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid property tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities which we may be obligated to pay but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and the lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this option will necessarily be available or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may lease their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs from lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from leasing such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties several states have enacted laws that provide that a lien for unpaid monies owed to an hoa may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties such actions if not cured may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on us 

vacant properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another we may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longer than assumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs and opportunity costs from lost revenues 

vacant homes may also be at risk for fraudulent activity which could impact our ability to lease a home as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues incur additional operating expenses and capital expenditures and our homes could be substantially impaired all of which may have a material adverse effect on us 

leasing fraud could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as leasing fraud as we make more of our services available over the internet we subject ourselves to new types of leasing fraud risk we use a variety of tools to protect against fraud however these tools may not always be successful allegations of fraud may result in fines settlements litigation expenses and reputational damage 

we rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening vendor partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity we make leasing decisions based on information in rental applications completed by a prospective resident and screened by our third party partner and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate additionally these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them additionally the covid19 outbreak as well as continuing measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors to limit the spread of this virus or mitigate its impact are interfering with the ability of some of our residents to meet their lease obligations and make their rent payments on time or at all furthermore entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as some state and local jurisdictions across the united states have imposed temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents are allowing residents to defer missed rent payments without incurring late fees and are prohibiting rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may 

expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to increase rents see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home alternatively to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year we may lose the opportunity to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires 

many factors impact the singlefamily rental market and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations our income and distributable cash could decline 

the success of our business model depends in part on conditions in the singlefamily rental market in which we operate one of the possible impacts on our results of operations and key operating metrics due to the restrictions on rent increases imposed in certain jurisdictions in response to the covid19 pandemic could be a decrease in gross rental revenues and other property income our investment strategy is based on assumptions about occupancy levels rental rates interest rates and other factors and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate our cash flows and profitability may be reduced multiple economic and demographic factors may contribute to increases or decreases in homeownership rates resulting in fluctuating rental rates and average occupancy levels in addition we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets and convert them to productive uses the supply of singlefamily rental properties will decrease which may increase competition for residents limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties a softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability 

we may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

renters impose additional risks to owning real property renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property accordingly renters may damage a property and its contents and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all a rental property may need repairs andor improvements after each resident vacates the premises the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased accordingly the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes including marketing leasing vendor communications finance intercompany communications our resident portals and property management service platforms which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure are subject and may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions due to the nature of some of the attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and implemented processes procedures and internal controls that are designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber incidents or security breaches any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings misstated or unreliable financial data liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems business continuity and disaster recovery issues which may result from the current covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic could materially interrupt our business operations due to the ongoing spread of covid19 cases in states where we operate and in connection with our flexible work arrangements a significant number of our associates based at our headquarters and local offices continue working remotely an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” 

our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity these joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed in addition we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control such actions could among other things impact our ability to maintain our status as a reit further investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our third party partners or coventurers 

we provide property management and other services on a contractual basis to coinvestors in certain of our joint ventures that invest in singlefamily rental properties these services include marketing leasing maintenance renovation accounting transaction management and financial markets services our exposure to liabilities in connection with such property management activities could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in a range of legal and regulatory proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal and regulatory proceedings may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims additionally our industry is under increasing political and regulatory scrutiny resulting in governmental inquiries relating to the conduct of our business generally and during the covid19 pandemic specifically including information relating to compliance with federal eviction moratorium requirements and cooperation with impacted residents to use federal assistance funds as an alternative to eviction these actions or inquiries may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind hail pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity fires or wind andor flood risk any and all such severe weather events may be exacerbated by global climate change resulting in increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage see “risks related to environmental social and governance issues — we are subject to risks 

from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather ” while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur casualty losses that are not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position in the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

eminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back stock 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions

climate change related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change and the transition to a lowercarbon economy may adversely affect our business 

there is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe an increase in the frequency severity and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters and water scarcity and poor water quality these events could also compound adverse economic conditions to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located we may experience extreme weather andor changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions and our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected see “ — we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather ” in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change including regulations aimed at 

limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of “green” building codes could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulations or industry standards as well as any international treaties and accords is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change 

we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes wind or floods and wildfires may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss of income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area additional consequences of severe weather could include increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage see “risks related to our business and industry — we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance ” 

we are subject to risks from events such as natural disasters severe weather and wildfires which may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations any and all of these factors may be exacerbated by global climate change see “ — climate change related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change and the transition to a lowercarbon economy may adversely affect our business  ” as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next we have in the past and may in the future incur losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we are subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

we are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors and others regarding our environmental social governance or sustainability responsibilities which could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation associate retention and ability to raise capital from such investors 

investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds other market participants and stakeholders have focused increasingly on the esg or “sustainability” practices of companies including those associated with climate change these parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments if our esg practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards which continue to evolve our reputation and associate retention may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our esg practices any sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters including corporate governance environmental compliance associate health and safety practices human capital management product quality supply chain management and workforce inclusion and diversity it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of their adoption we could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with various esg practices in addition investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the esg factors 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms and 7 the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures if the income from a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could have material and adverse effect on our residents’ ability to meet their lease obligations and our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for failure to pay rent thereby reducing our cash flows and the resulting impact on rental and other property income could impact our ability to make all required debt service payments and to continue paying dividends to our stockholders at expected levels or at all see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had 80624 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

our access to additional third party sources of financing will depend in part on 

• general market conditions 

• the market’s perception of our growth potential 

• with respect to acquisition financing the market’s perception of the value of the homes to be acquired 

• our current debt levels 

• our current and expected future earnings 

• our cash flow and cash distributions and 

• the market price of our common stock 

potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing consequently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms if at all 

a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our financing ability  

our credit ratings affect the amount and type of capital as well as the terms and pricing of any financing we may obtain if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring secured mortgage indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder andor the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt andor otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default a default under one of our debt agreements could result in a crossdefault under other debt agreements and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable terminate their commitments require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral in accordance with our facility agreements is not available 

for example our mortgage loans and secured term loan require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash in such cash management account as the lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans 

these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes 

we have and may continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and may continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy’s previous recession coupled with a general decline in business activity resulting from the covid19 pandemic have caused dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgagebacked securities as well as disruption in the wider global financial markets including a significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of 

potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate increases may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments totaling 45719 million as of december 31 2021 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase including during 2022 based on recent statements by the united states federal reserve and their plans to raise benchmark interest rates our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” for more information each 100 bps increase or decrease on our floating rate indebtedness would result in an estimated increase of 15 million or 209 million respectively in annual interest expense a 100 bps decrease in the london interbank offered rate “libor” results in a negative libor rate and additional interest expense for us our credit facility agreement contains a libor floor and there is no reciprocal feature in our interest rate swap agreements 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items — complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities ” 

expected phasing out of libor may adversely affect the capital markets and our ability to raise capital when libor is discontinued our variable rate debt agreements and financial instruments may be calculated using another base rate 

on march 5 2021 the financial conduct authority of the united kingdom which has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor announced that it would cease publication of the one week and two month usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 accordingly in the near future libor will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate the current and any future reforms and other pressures may cause libor to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past including during the transition period as of december 31 2021 we had 45719 million of variable rate debt outstanding that references one month libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount and for which maturities extend past june 2023 assuming all extensions are exercised the agreements underlying 

our outstanding variable debt contemplate procedures for transitioning from libor upon the occurrence of specified events nevertheless the consequences of these market developments cannot be entirely predicted and a transition from libor even if administered consistent with the credit facility’s provisions could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness if one month libor is discontinued during 2023 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the agreement and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously recorded transactions and may impact our existing transaction data operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest expense libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborbased securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us and on our overall financial condition or results of operations additionally debt holders or governing bodies may decide to transition to a successor rate prior to the expected libor phaseout date

we believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit and that our current organization and proposed method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist and we cannot assure you that we qualify or that we will remain qualified as a reit our qualification as a reit depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis and even a technical or inadvertent violation of these requirements could jeopardize our reit qualification furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year and we do not qualify for relief under applicable statutory provisions then 

• we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation a “c corporation” which under current laws means among other things being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to united states federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates 

• any resulting tax liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our book value 

• we would be required to pay taxes and thus our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a reit and for which we had taxable income 

• we could be subject to increased state and local taxes and 

• we generally would not be eligible to requalify as a reit for the subsequent four full taxable years 

reits in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash flows 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may be subject to certain united states federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure and state or local income property and transfer taxes in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum 

amount specified under the code and we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain our qualification as a reit furthermore in order to meet the reit qualification requirements or to avert the imposition of a 100 tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from dealer property or inventory we conduct some of our operations and hold some of our assets through a trs or other subsidiary corporations that are subject to united states federal state and local corporate taxes any of the aforementioned taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock to meet these tests we may be required to take or forgo taking actions that we would otherwise consider advantageous for instance in order to satisfy the gross income or asset tests applicable to reits under the code we may be required to forgo investments that we otherwise would make furthermore we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments these actions could reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in trss cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences in addition to the quarterly asset test requirements we must annually satisfy two income test requirements the “75 and 95 gross income tests” as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a trs otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders we may be unable to pursue investments that would otherwise be advantageous to us in order to satisfy the income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

the prohibited transactions tax may limit our ability to engage in sale transactions 

a reit’s income from “prohibited transactions” is subject to a 100 tax in general “prohibited transactions” are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business we may be subject to the prohibited transactions tax equal to 100 of net gain upon a disposition of real property that we hold although a safe harbor is available for which certain sales of property by a reit are not subject to the 100 prohibited transaction tax we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business consequently we may choose not to engage in certain sales of our properties or we may conduct such sales through our trs which would be subject to united states federal and state income taxation in addition we may have to sell numerous properties to a single or a few purchasers which could cause us to be less profitable than would be the case if we sold properties on a propertybyproperty basis for example if we decide to acquire properties opportunistically to renovate in anticipation of immediate resale we will need to conduct that activity through a trs to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax 

the 100 tax described above may limit our ability to enter into transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us for example if circumstances make it not profitable or otherwise uneconomical for us to remain in certain states or geographical markets the 100 tax could delay our ability to exit those states or markets by selling our assets in those states or markets other than through a trs which could harm our operating profits and the trading price of our stock in addition in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax we may be required to limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge liabilities income from hedging transactions that do not meet the specific requirements of these provisions will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of the 75 and 95 gross income tests as a result of these rules we may have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains for which losses may not be available or allowed to offset or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear 

even if we qualify to be subject to united states federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo reorganization transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to united states federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains further such builtin gains may also be subject to certain state income taxes for a length of time equal to or exceeding the federal fiveyear period we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the builtin gain tax however there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares of stock whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future and any decision to grant a waiver from the ownership limit in any particular instance is at the sole discretion of 

our board of directors any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds or our own funds to make distributions 

the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets issue distributions in our own stock or reduce our distributions 

furthermore if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 

we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for united states federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their stock a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s stock they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock that require you to pay income taxes in excess of any cash distributions 

we may make distributions to our stockholders that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock as a result stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash portion of the distribution received and it may be necessary to sell stocks received in such distribution at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution furthermore with respect to certain nonunited states holders we may be required to withhold united states tax with respect to such distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

the internal revenue service the united states treasury department and congress frequently review united states federal income tax legislation regulations and other guidance we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new united states federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be adopted any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and therefore may adversely affect our taxation or our stockholders any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as c corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a c corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a c corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

our ownership of trss is subject to limitations and our transactions with our trss will cause us to be subject to a 100 excise tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm’slength terms 

the code provides that no more than 20 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss our trss earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit and may also be used to hold certain properties the sale of which may not qualify for the safe harbor for prohibited transactions these limitations on ownership of trs stock could limit the extent to which we can conduct these activities and other activities through our trss in addition the tax rules may limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the trs limitations or avoid application of the 100 excise tax

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has spread rapidly adversely affecting public health economic activity financial markets and employment the continued development and fastchanging nature of the covid19 pandemic creates many unknowns that impact our residents associates and suppliers the ultimate impacts remain unknown but have included and could range from macroeconomic effects such as continued strain on global and united states economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets consumer spending supply chains and the market for acquisition and disposition of singlefamily homes to more industryspecific effects such as depressed collection rates higher or lower occupancy levels and restrictions on evictions collections rent increases and late fees and other unanticipated consequences 

throughout the covid19 pandemic we have maintained continuity in business operations and have supported our residents and associates by implementing a host of measures and protocols that enable our teams to safely provide outstanding service to residents these protocols include 1 implementing a safety training program and providing personal protective equipment for all associates 2 creating flexible work schedules for our associates in terms of both location and hours of work 3 adhering to strict safety protocols for maintenance service trips 4 leveraging selfshow and virtualtour technology and 5 offering virtual options for resident movein orientations and premoveout visits

neither the aforementioned procedural adjustments nor the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic created significant disruptions to our business model during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

the situation surrounding the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its variants remains fluid and we continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and manage our response in collaboration with our residents and business partners and to assess potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as potential adverse developments in our business 

for further discussion of risks related to the pandemic see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our business and industry — our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic ” in our annual report on form 10k 

other matters 

in july 2021 we received congressional inquiries requesting information and documentation about our eviction practices during the covid19 pandemic including information relating to compliance with federal eviction moratorium requirements and cooperation with impacted residents to use federal assistance funds as an alternative to eviction in october 2021 and january 2022 we received additional congressional inquiries requesting information about our activities in the housing market we are in the process of responding to and cooperating with these inquiries and information requests 

in august 2021 we received a letter from the staff of the federal trade commission requesting information as to how we conduct our business generally and during the covid19 pandemic specifically we are in the process of responding to and cooperating with this request 

as these inquiries are ongoing we cannot currently predict their timing outcome or scope 

climate change 

climate change continues to attract considerable public political and scientific attention experiencing or addressing the various physical regulatory and adaptationtransition risks of climate change may affect our profitability government authorities and various interest groups are promoting laws and regulations relating to climate change including regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of “green” building codes these laws and regulations may require us to make costly improvements to our existing properties beyond our current plans to decrease the impact of our homes on the environment resulting in increased operating costs implementation of any voluntary improvements requires consideration of multiple factors including whether such elections would raise our costs to maintain our homes alternatively choosing not to enhance our homes’ resource efficiency could make our portfolio less attractive to residents and investors andor increase the vulnerability of our residents to rising energy and water expenses and use restrictions 

as the climate continues to change and with a portfolio located in a variety of united states markets that include coastal areas we recognize the increased potential for acute weather events and other climaterelated impacts to our business operations and homes we take a proactive approach to protect our properties against potential risks related to climate change and business interruptions and we recognize that we must continue to adapt our policies objectives and processes to improve the resiliency of our physical properties and our business 

our management and the board of directors are focused on managing our business risks including climate changerelated risks the process to identify manage and integrate climatechange risk is part of our enterprise risk management program for more information on risks related to climate change see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to environmental social and governance issues — climate change related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change and the transition to a lowercarbon economy may adversely affect our business  and — we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather ”

factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control see part i item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals rental rates and occupancy levels collection rates turnover rates and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance property acquisitions and renovations and financing arrangements sensitivity to many of these factors has been heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of covid19 

market fundamentals our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 711 of our rental revenues and other property income during the year ended december 31 2021 we actively monitor the impact of the covid19 outbreak and its resulting macroeconomic impacts on market fundamentals and quickly implement changes in pricing as market fundamentals shift 

rental rates and occupancy levels rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years the ongoing covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to increase rents in certain markets 

collection rates our rental revenues and other property income is impacted by the rate at which we collect such revenues from our residents we routinely work with residents facing financial hardships who need flexibility to fulfill their lease obligations but the ongoing covid19 pandemic has increased the number of such residents when requested we work with these residents to create payment plans without late fees and then actively manage these receivables additionally we work with residents to identify and pursue rental assistance payments from various federal state and local government and other entities providing such assistance despite these efforts a portion of amounts receivable may not ultimately be collected any amounts billed to residents that have been deemed uncollectible along with our estimate of amounts that may ultimately be uncollectible decrease our rental revenues and other property income 

turnover rates and days to reresident other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents resident turnover rates and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property which is a component of the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks andor source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business and both current economic conditions and future economic outlook many of these factors have been and continue to be impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic additionally our turnover rate may be affected by the current covid19 pandemic as a result of delayed eviction proceedings andor move outs potentially being canceled by residents who have not secured their next housing plans increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period of vacancy 

property improvements and maintenance property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

while the covid19 outbreak has required us to modify our property improvement and maintenance procedures to accommodate resident preferences we complete all maintenance work orders in a timely manner unless a resident reports symptoms of or exposure to covid19 

property acquisitions and renovations future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets all of these factors may be negatively impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic potentially reducing the number of homes we acquire 

the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental the scope of renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property whether the property was vacant when acquired and whether there are any state or local restrictions on our ability to complete renovations as an essential business function additionally the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks andor source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business have increased the time required to renovate our homes due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense our various debt instruments and our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and certain financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms interest rates are impacted by market conditions and the terms of the underlying financing arrangements the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economy and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively affect our ability to access financial markets as well as our business results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we owned 82381 and 80177 singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we acquired 2938 and 2252 homes respectively and sold 734 and 1580 homes respectively during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we owned an average of 80901 and 79530 singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio 

we believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of both a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business to do so we provide information regarding the performance of our same store portfolio 

as of december 31 2021 our same store portfolio consisted of 72245 singlefamily rental homes 

revenues 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 total revenues were 19966 million and 18228 million respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total revenues 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled 19917 million and 18228 million respectively an increase of 93 driven by an increase in average occupancy an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and an 1371 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned 

average occupancy for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 for the total portfolio was 970 and 961 respectively average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 1972 and 1875 respectively a 52 increase for our same store portfolio average occupancy was 982 and 975 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and average monthly rent per occupied home for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 1969 and 1874 respectively a 51 increase 

the annual turnover rate for the same store portfolio for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 229 and 264 respectively for the same store portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 28 and 36 days between residents for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the decreases in these two metrics contributed to our increase in average occupancy on a year over year basis our turnover rate may have been and may continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic eg eviction moratoriums and residents who are not inclined to relocate during this period we cannot predict how long existing eviction moratoriums will remain in place if new eviction moratoriums will be issued andor reinstated or when the general effects of the pandemic will subside and how those items may affect our turnover and occupancy rates 

to monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized nonservice concessions to calculate net effective rental rate growth leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home 

renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 67 and 37 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 143 and 44 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively for our same store portfolio renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 67 and 37 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 144 and 42 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted rental revenues and other property income since the onset of the pandemic in midmarch 2020 in two notable ways 1 collection rates have decreased from prepandemic levels which negatively impacts bad debt as a percentage of gross rental income and 2 a significant portion of all late fees typically enforced in accordance with our lease agreements were not enforced or collected for a significant period of time as of the third quarter of 2021 bad debt began to moderate compared to the year ended december 31 2020 enforcement and collections of late fees generally recommenced in all markets where permissible beginning in the second quarter of 2021 while the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the ensuing jurisdictional restrictions on rental rates late fees collections and evictions have decreased over time they may continue to affect our future collection rates ability to increase rental revenues in certain markets and fees and other ancillary income charged to residents 

for the year ended december 31 2021 joint venture management fees totaled 49 million 

expenses 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 total expenses were 17770 million and 17096 million respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2021 property operating and maintenance expense increased to 7062 million from 6805 million for the year ended december 31 2020 in addition to an 1371 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned increases in property taxes utilities personnel and other services costs and hoa expenses partially offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance and turnover costs resulted in the overall 38 net increase in property operating and maintenance expense 

property management expense and general and administrative expense increased to 1474 million from 1219 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase is comprised primarily of a 101 million increase in sharebased compensation expense due to changes in expected results for performancebased awards and a 97 million increase in short term incentive plan compensation based on estimated annual performance to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our property management and general and administrative expenses 

interest expense decreased from 3539 million for the year ended december 31 2020 to 3227 million for the year ended december 31 2021 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to refinancing activities since december 31 2020 and the impact of the december 2020 amended and restated credit facility during the year ended december 31 2021 we issued 19500 million of newly issued unsecured notes repaid 17669 million of mortgage loan indebtedness and converted 2035 million of convertible debt into shares of our common stock these financing activities resulted in a 25 bps decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt between the respective period ends inclusive of a 55 bps reduction in the spread on our term loan facility as a result of achieving an investment grade rating 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 5921 million for the year ended december 31 2021 from 5525 million for the year ended december 31 2020 due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures and an increase in the average number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

impairment and other expenses were 87 million and 07 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively during the year ended december 31 2021 impairment and other expenses were comprised of impairment losses of 07 million on our singlefamily residential properties and net casualty losses of 80 million during the year ended december 31 2020 impairment and other expenses were comprised of impairment losses of 46 million on our singlefamily residential properties offset by net gains on casualty losses of 39 million the impairment costs recognized during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were not a direct result of the covid19 pandemic 

gains losses on investments in equity securities net 

for the year ended december 31 2021 94 million of losses on investments in equity securities net was comprised of 55 million of net losses recognized on investments sold during the year including the reversal of unrealized gains recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 and 39 million net unrealized losses recognized on investments held as of december 31 2021 for the year ended december 31 2020 297 million of unrealized gains were recognized on investments held as of year end 

other net 

other net was 58 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to lower interest income from our investments in debt securities and increases in transaction and administrative costs between those periods partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a 18 million rou lease impairment during the year ended december 31 2020 additionally joint venture management fees and income loss from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures presented separately on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 were included in other net during the year ended december 31 2020 

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property net of tax was 600 million and 546 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the primary driver of the increase was an increase in disposition proceeds received per home between periods offset by a decrease in the number of homes sold from 1580 for the year ended december 31 2020 to 734 for the year ended december 31 2021 

income loss from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

income loss from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was comprised of our equity in earnings andor losses therefrom on a net basis 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2021 and 2020 include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 6102 million and 2134 million respectively a 1859 increase primarily due to the capital markets activity described below net of cash used to fund acquisitions of singlefamily residential properties the following significant activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2021

our ability to access capital as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and general economic conditions as detailed in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

longterm debt strategy

7 effective july 15 2021 we notified note holders of our intent to settle conversions of the 2022 convertible notes in shares of common stock on january 18 2022 we settled the outstanding principal balance of the 2022 convertible notes with the issuance of 6216261 shares of our common stock and a cash payment of 03 million 

as part of our longterm debt strategy our goal is to improve our credit ratings and over time we generally intend to target a reduction in our level of net debt to approximately 55 to 60 times trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda re see “— nongaap measures — ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitdar e ” a reduction in our level of secured debt to less than 20 of gross assets and an increase in our level of unencumbered assets to greater than 70 of gross assets to facilitate our longterm debt strategy we expect to seek to among other things a refinance a significant portion of our secured debt maturing in 2025 through 2026 assuming all extension options are exercised with unsecured debt including potential unsecured bond issuances andor b repay a portion of such debt there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our longterm debt strategy improving our credit ratings or achieving our targets in the short or medium term or at all or that we will not change our strategy or targets in the future even if we do achieve our targets we may from time to time fall outside of our target ranges and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet our targets in addition we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional unsecured debt financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us for further discussion of risks related to our indebtedness see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our indebtedness” including “risk factors — risks related to our indebtedness — we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations ” 

shortterm and longterm liquidity needs 

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make dividend payments to our stockholders and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of 

• acquisition of homes currently under contract 

• renovation of newlyacquired homes 

• hoa fees as applicable property taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance of our homes 

• property management and general and administrative expenses 

• interest expense 

• dividend payments to our equity investors and 

• required contributions to our joint ventures 

we believe our rental income net of total expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a nearterm basis additionally we have guaranteed the funding of certain tax insurance and nonconforming property reserves related to the financing of one of our joint ventures we do not expect this guarantee to have a material current or future effect on our liquidity see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statements — note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

however the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our operating cash flow such that we are unable to make required debt service payments which would result in an event of default for any debt instrument under whose loan 

agreement such payments were not made specifically the collateral within individual borrower entities may underperform resulting in cash flow shortfalls for debt service while consolidated cash flows are sufficient to fund our operations if an event of default occurs for a specific mortgage loan or for our secured term loan our loan agreements provide certain remedies including our ability to fund shortfalls from consolidated cash flow and such an event of default would not result in an immediate acceleration of the loan 

our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing sources such as the revolving facility which had an undrawn balance of 10000 million as of december 31 2021 

our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal and interest payments of our indebtedness we intend to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 consist of the following 





1 for detailed information about each of our financing arrangements and derivative instruments see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statements — note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

2 includes estimated interest payments through the extended maturity date based on the principal amount outstanding as of december 31 2021 interest is calculated at rates in effect as of such date for libor based loans the december 31 2021 libor or 010 is held constant until the maturity date 

3 represents the maturity date if we exercise each of the remaining extension options available which are subject to certain conditions being met see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statements — note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements” for a description of maturity dates without consideration of extension options 

4 includes the related unused commitment fee 

5 represents the principal amount and interest obligation of the 2022 convertible notes which is calculated using the notes’ coupon rate the 2022 convertible notes principal amount of 1415 million is included in 2022 maturities presented above on january 18 2022 we settled the outstanding principal balance of the 2022 convertible notes with the issuance of 6216261 shares of our common stock and a cash payment of 03 million 

6 includes interest rate swap and interest rate cap obligations calculated using libor as of december 31 2021 or 010 

7 represents commitments to acquire 360 singlefamily rental homes the amounts above do not include commitments pursuant to binding purchase agreements with certain homebuilders for the purchase of 1357 homes over the next six years estimated remaining commitments under these agreements total approximately 4200 million as of december 31 2021 

additionally we have a commitment which is not reflected in the table above to make additional capital contributions to our joint ventures as of december 31 2021 our remaining equity commitments to the joint ventures total 2444 million 

libor transition 

certain securitizations the secured term loan the term loan facility and the revolving facility collectively the “liborbased loans” use the one month libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates our derivative instruments are also indexed to one month libor on march 5 2021 the financial conduct authority of the united kingdom which has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor announced that it would cease publication of the one week and two month usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 once one month libor is phased out after june 30 2023 the interest rates for our liborbased loans will be based on a comparable or successor rate as provided for in our loan agreements we will work with the counterparties to our swap and cap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs the ultimate outcome of this change is uncertain at this time and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models 

supplemental guarantor information 

in march 2020 the sec adopted amendments to rule 310 of regulation sx and created rule 1301 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities the amendments became effective on january 4 2021 invh invh lp the general partner and ih merger sub llc “ih merger sub” have filed a registration statement on form s3 with the sec registering among other securities debt securities of invh lp fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by invh the general partner andor ih merger sub as a result of the amendments to rule 310 of regulation sx subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company’s consolidated financial statements the parent guarantee is “full and unconditional” and subject to certain exceptions as set forth below the alternative disclosure required by rule 1301 is provided which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information accordingly separate consolidated financial statements of invh lp the general partner and ih merger sub have not been presented 

furthermore as permitted under rule 1301a4vi of regulation sx we have excluded the summarized financial information for the invh lp the general partner and ih merger sub because the combined assets liabilities and results of operations of invh invh lp the general partner and ih merger sub are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors 

purchase of outstanding debt securities or loans 

as market conditions warrant we may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt or debt securities that we may issue in the future in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt including borrowings under our credit facility the amounts involved in any such purchase transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series in addition any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” as defined for united states federal income tax purposes may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us which amounts may be material and in related adverse tax consequences to us

net cash provided by used in financing activities was 6590 million and 1460 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively during the year ended december 31 2021 we received 19380 million of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of unsecured notes which were used to repay 17669 million of principal on our mortgage loans including full repayment of ih 20172 and partial repayments of ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 issuances and sales of stock under our terminated 2019 atm equity program and the 2021 public offering generated 9338 million of net proceeds during the year ended december 31 2021 during that period we also made 3959 million of dividend and distribution payments during the year ended december 31 2020 proceeds from our new term loan facility of 25000 million and from issuances and sales of stock under our public offering and terminated atm equity program of 6867 million along with proceeds from home sales were used 1 to repay the 15000 million outstanding balance of our 2017 term loan facility 2 to repay 14346 million of our mortgage loans including full 

repayment of swh 20171 and partial repayments of ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 and 3 to fund 3343 million of dividend and distribution payments 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our year ended december 31 2020 results compared to our year ended december 31 2019 results refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 2020 10k  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recentlyissued and adopted accounting standards see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

investments in singlefamily residential properties 

the following significant accounting policies affect the acquisition disposition recognition classification and fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis related to our portfolio of over 80000 singlefamily residentia l properties in 16 markets across the united states for a complete discussion of our accounting policy and other factors related to each category below see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

• acquisition of real estate assets our purchases of homes are generally treated as asset acquisitions unless acquired in connection with a business combination for asset acquisitions homes are recorded at their purchase price which is allocated between land building and improvements and inplace lease intangibles when a resident is in place at the acquisition date based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition the purchase price for purposes of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees bidding service and title fees payments made to cure tax utility hoa and other mechanic’s and miscellaneous liens as well as other closing costs the attributes and location of each home acquired are considered at the individual home level when determining the percentage of purchase price allocated to building and improvements versus land as such these allocation percentages vary based on the homes acquired during each reporting period if the percentage allocated to buildings and improvements versus land for the homes acquired during the year ended december 31 2021 was increased or decreased by 500 bps our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 20 million 

• cost capitalization we incur costs to acquire stabilize and prepare our singlefamily residential properties to be leased we capitalize these costs as a component of our investment in each singlefamily residential property using specific identification and relative allocation methodologies the capitalization period associated with our stabilization activities begins at the time that such activities commence and concludes at the time that a singlefamily residential property is available to be leased 

once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions 

the capitalized costs are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which are reviewed on an annual basis the weighted average useful lives range from 7 years to 285 years there have not been any significant changes in our estimate of useful lives during the current reporting period if the useful lives for costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2021 were increased or decreased by 10 our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 60 million 

• provisions for impairment we continuously evaluate by property whether there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our singlefamily residential properties may not be recoverable to the extent an event or change in circumstance is identified a residential property is considered to be impaired only if its carrying value cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property to the extent an impairment has occurred the carrying amount of our investment in a property is adjusted to its estimated fair value the process whereby we assess our singlefamily residential properties for impairment requires significant judgment and assessment of factors that are at times subject to significant uncertainty we evaluate multiple information sources and perform a number of internal analyses each of which are important components of our process with no one information source or analysis being necessarily determinative there have not been any significant process changes in our review for impairment during the current reporting period for those homes for which a change in an event or circumstance was identified in the most recent impairment analysis a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of those homes may have resulted in an increase in impairment expense of approximately 03 million 

• singlefamily residential properties held for sale from time to time we may identify singlefamily residential properties to be sold once we identify a property to be sold pursuant to gaap requirements we cease depreciating the property measure the property at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less estimated costs to sell and present the property separately within other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 80 homes less than 01 of our portfolio were held for sale compared to 179 homes as of december 31 2020 if market values less disposal costs for our properties that were classified as held for sale as of december 31 2021 were 10 lower our impairment expense related to those properties would have increased by approximately 03 million if the market values less disposal costs were 10 higher our impairment expense would not have changed 

segment reporting 

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the codm in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer 

under the provisions of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes noi as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level with a focus on accretive growth in highgrowth locations where we have greater scale and density 

nongaap measures 

ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare 

ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap before the following items interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” recommends as a best practice that reits that report an ebitda performance measure also report ebitda re  consistent with the nareit definition we define ebitda re as ebitda further adjusted for the following gain on sale of property net of tax impairment on depreciated real estate investments and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 

adjusted ebitda re is defined as ebitda re before the following items sharebased compensation expense severance merger and transactionrelated expenses casualty gains losses net gains losses on investments in equity securities net and other income and expenses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re is net income or loss ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re may not be comparable to the ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with gaap to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re for each of the periods indicated 





1 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 5427 3511 and 3075 was recorded in property management expense respectively and 21743 13579 and 15083 was recorded in general and administrative expense respectively

3 includes interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses 

net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses utility expenses repairs and maintenance and property administration noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization property management expense general and administrative expense impairment and other gain on sale of property net of tax gains losses on investments in equity securities net other income and expenses joint venture management fees and income loss from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with gaap to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio for each of the periods indicated 





1 includes 5427 3511 and 3075 of sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 includes 21743 13579 and 15083 of sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

3 includes interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses

funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by nareit as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes as well noncontrolling interests from net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in homes however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for the following noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs loan discounts and noncash interest expense from derivatives sharebased compensation expense severance expense merger and transactionrelated expense casualty gains losses net and gains losses on investments in equity securities net as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain the functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo no adjustments were made to the core ffo and adjusted ffo per common share — diluted computations for potential shares of common stock related to the convertible senior notes accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with gaap to ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo for each of the periods indicated

with respect to the 2022 convertible notes during the year ended december 31 2021 at the election of the note holders we settled 203510 of principal outstanding for the 2022 convertible notes with the issuance of 8943374 shares of common stock these issued shares of common stock are included within all net income ffo core ffo and affo per common share calculations subsequent to the conversion date 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the numerator for ffo per common share — diluted is adjusted for interest expense on the 2022 convertible notes including noncash amortization of discounts totaling 14364 and 17181 respectively and the denominator is adjusted for 11293203 and 15100443 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2022 convertible notes respectively no such adjustments were made to core ffo and affo per common share —diluted for the year ended december 31 2019 15100443 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2022 convertible notes are excluded from the computation of net income or loss and ffo per common share — diluted as they are antidilutive and are excluded from core ffo and affo per common share — diluted 

5 incremental shares attributed to nonvested sharebased awards totaling 1528453 1465286 and 1263825 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively are included in weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of net income per common share — diluted for the computations of ffo core ffo and affo per common share — diluted common share equivalents of 1822015 1851297 and 1748787 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively related to incremental shares attributed to nonvested sharebased awards are included in the denominator 

6 vested units of partnership interests in invh lp “op units” have been excluded from the computation of net income per common share — diluted for the periods above because all net income attributable to the vested op units has been recorded as noncontrolling interest and thus excluded from net income available to common stockholders weighted average vested op units of 2939381 3463285 and 5940757 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively are included in the denominator for the computations of ffo core ffo and affo per common share — diluted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that we may borrow under the credit facility in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2021 our outstanding variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 20719 million and term loan facility of 25000 million for a combined total of 45719 million we effectively converted 967 of these borrowings to a fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements additionally all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt the projected effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in libor on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase of 15 million or 209 million respectively this estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements interest rate cap agreements and any libor floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings a 100 bps decrease in libor results in a negative libor rate and additional interest expense for us our credit facility agreement contains a libor floor and there is no reciprocal feature in our interest rate swap agreements 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs and costs to reresident during the summer season

occupancy and turnover rates and improve our cost management and oversight over both upfront renovations and ongoing maintenance 

marketing and leasing 

our inhouse personnel are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received andor showings a property has experienced since becoming available and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including our proprietary website internet listing services such as zillow trulia hotpads and realtorcom mls yard signs search engine marketing social and other digital media and local brokers we offer flexible showing options for convenience including virtual tours and floor plans on our website selfshowings that leverage the home’s smart home technology and inperson agent showings we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and primarily utilize inmarket leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes in some markets we also utilize a network of local real estate agents to show homes to prospective residents and offer those agents limited cobroker fees 

prospective residents may submit an application through the application portal on our website or in person in order to maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements we utilize standardized online applications national lease agreements movein and moveout documents resident communications and other ancillary documents we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity although we require a minimum income to rent ratio many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process including eviction history criminal history and rental and other payment history 

our disciplined investment strategy and local inmarket approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods enabling us to execute costeffective advertising targeting potential residents whose online behaviors indicate interest in these neighborhoods we believe this increases our likelihood of capturing and retaining residents enhancing our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services 

digital marketing initiatives and branding 

we encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website blog and social media accounts with articles home maintenance advice contests and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes for example we alert our residents to prepare for storms incentivize them to pay their rent online offer “lease friendly” “make it home” design tips and contests and hold an annual resident appreciation day resident engagement and social following continue to grow and we receive positive feedback from residents who specifically mention our approachable lifestyle and home maintenance content that helps them make a house a home 

resident relations and property maintenance 

our inhouse personnel in each of our markets are also responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations in coordination with a third party vendor we offer a 247 emergency telephone line to handle after hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed and our residents can also contact us through our online resident portal our call centers or our local property management offices as part of our ongoing property management process we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner as appropriate by appointment at the resident’s convenience we seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize longterm rental income and cash flows from our portfolio 

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance personnel in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing heating ventilation and air conditioning “hvac” systems plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners we strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our inhouse maintenance technicians in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance personnel provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse maintenance personnel conduct periodic visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventative maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations we have temporarily paused a portion of these visits due to the ongoing pandemic 

procare service our property management service platform includes several touchpoints over the term of a resident’s lease designed to enhance their satisfaction with our service model improve the efficiency of our service and ensure that each resident is properly educated regarding the home and their responsibilities when a new resident moves into one of our homes our inhouse personnel conduct a resident orientation sometimes virtual due to the ongoing pandemic during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post movein maintenance visit following the movein orientation each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items noted after moving into the home at the time of the post movein maintenance visit approximately 45 days after movein sometimes virtual due to the ongoing pandemic our inhouse property maintenance personnel will address any nonemergency service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance personnel finally the post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance personnel in each of our markets also conduct midlease preventive maintenance visits during preventive maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance personnel inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and carbon monoxide detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct pre moveout visits 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these visits allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these visits allow our inhouse property maintenance personnel to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these visits also increase our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance personnel to assess and document interior and exterior conditions whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed if a deficiency is identified by our inhouse property maintenance personnel we endeavor to take prompt action to correct it 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and 

rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select and on an ongoing basis evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 16 markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base that will experience robust longterm demand and that will benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze numerous factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools and transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria to date we have underwritten more than one million individual homes which gives us a substantial proprietary database on which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets the number of homes underwritten represents the total number of acquisition opportunities that we have considered and of which we have conducted preliminary analysis including acquisition opportunities that were ultimately not pursued or completed as a result of our selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local market real estate brokers and others and leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated personnel located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals evaluate the structural needs and major systems of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of our homes’ fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental occupancy or turnover rates 

through local oversight by inhouse personnel of the entire process of renovating our homes we are able to drive cost efficiencies each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing both time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages approximately 5000 homes per market as of december 31 2020 allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale

at invitation homes we are committed to creating an exceptional leasing experience for our residents and leading the singlefamily industry by example as the nation’s premier home leasing company we have an opportunity to make a profound impact by offering quality homes where our residents can feel safe and careers where our associates can thrive our mission vision and values define our daily actions in delivering on our pledge to be a responsible corporate citizen our mission statement “together with you we make a house a home” reflects our commitment to a residentcentric business philosophy it is important that each day we live out our values of unshakeable integrity genuine care continuous excellence and standout citizenship as we strive to benefit our residents our associates our communities and our shareholders while at the same time advancing efforts that make us more innovative and our processes more sustainable 

we believe that integrating environmental social and governance initiatives into our strategic business objectives is critical to our longterm success in the fourth quarter of 2020 we launched a formal environmental social and governance “esg” materiality assessment to identify opportunities for us to make the biggest impact in the areas that our stakeholders prioritize in order to ensure consistent attention and focus on esg matters we have created a dedicated crossfunctional esg task force of associates led by executive management as a part of their role as stewards of our company’s longterm performance our board of directors plays a critical role in understanding how esg issues affect our business strategy and performance and provides oversight with respect to our esg initiatives and policies this responsibility is assigned to the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors the nominating and corporate governance committee works closely with management and regularly meets with and reports to the board of directors on our esg strategy initiatives and policies we also believe in the value of feedback and we hold ourselves accountable to that end we participate in the gresb real estate assessment for a thirdparty evaluation of our esg performance and have linked this performance to the pricing of our revolving credit facility whereby improvements in our gresb score over time can benefit our borrowing costs under the facility through our integrated and ongoing approach to sustainability and corporate responsibility we seek to drive positive change and create value for our stakeholders 

sustainability and corporate social responsibility are vitally important to who we are as a company our guiding social responsibility business and workplace policies apply to our directors officers associates and vendors and they are posted on our website these policies apply to all activities undertaken by or on behalf of invitation homes anywhere we operate among other things these policies encompass areas of community and associate engagement diversity and inclusion human rights corporate governance and ethics and environmental initiatives that reflect existing and emerging standards of corporate social responsibility

while our residents are responsible for utilities that control energy and water usage we take a proactive approach to improving the environmental footprint of our portfolio by among other things 

• using energyefficient energy star® certified appliances when feasible

• launching an hvac air filter home delivery program for our residents which may prolong the life of our hvac systems may reduce expenses associated with repairs may minimize downtime associated with system failure and may provide better air quality in the home 

as the climate continues to change and with a portfolio located in a variety of united states markets that include coastal areas we recognize the increased likelihood of acute weather events and other climaterelated impacts to our business operations and homes we take a proactive approach to protect our properties against potential risks related to climate change and business interruptions and we recognize that we must continue to adapt our policies objectives and processes to improve the resiliency of our physical properties and our business

in march 2020 to act on our core values of genuine care and standout citizenship we began to offer solutions for residents experiencing financial hardship when requested including the ongoing creation of payment plans without late fees for residents requiring flexibility to meet rental obligations over time additionally we continue to adhere to federal state and local restrictions on items such as evictions collections rent increases and late fees as appropriate 

we also believe it is important to listen to our residents and we take their feedback to heart on our quest to continuously enhance the genuine care we provide we survey residents at each key step in their journey with invitation homes such as at movein and moveout and after every inperson interaction they have with an invitation homes associate or vendor we use this feedback to hold ourselves accountable with all of our associates having a portion of their compensation tied directly to resident satisfaction survey scores we also use feedback from surveys and focus groups to help inform new service offerings and enhancements we make to the resident experience in addition to our website and resident surveys we engage with our residents through monthly resident newsletters blog posts and social media campaigns and contests

driving techniques and vehicle condition and safety features additionally in response to the covid19 pandemic we established a task force that crafted a “safe work playbook” and “interim policy guide” outlining a consistent way for each of our offices to return to work safely when it is appropriate to do so we also created formal training for both our fieldbased and officebased associates to educate and train on these new safety practices and protocols the majority of our officebased associates continue to work from home and will do so until we determine it is in our and their best interests to fully return to our offices

communities 

being a good neighbor is critical in the communities where we do business this includes volunteering in our local communities and contributing dollars to nonprofit organizations doing good in our markets it also involves the full economic impact of our business on the community through home renovations completed by local vendors real estate taxes hoa fees and dues and locally purchased goods and services we recognize that the vitality of our business is directly linked to the vitality of the communities in which we operate we invest in upfront renovations of our homes and maintain them to high standards through timely maintenance services as of december 31 2020 we and our predecessors have invested approximately 24 billion in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio we invested approximately 39000 per home for upfront renovations completed during the year ended december 31 2020 further we maintain our homes to high standards through timely maintenance services as well as through our proprietary procare service we believe that these investments benefit our communities by creating jobs enhancing neighborhood appearance and livability and improving the overall quality of life for our residents and their neighbors in addition we believe such investments improve our relationships with local communities and hoas and enhance our brand recognition and loyalty 

we believe our values of genuine care and standout citizenship should extend beyond the walls of our offices and drive our desire to be a good neighbor in each of our communities while we have a companywide community impact mantra of “go do good” much of our community engagement is locally driven we believe in empowering our associates to make an impact in the communities where they work and reside by partnering with local organizations to provide support to those in need in addition each year invitation homes associates receive 20 hours of paid time to volunteer in their communities and help their local neighbors during 2020 many of our nonprofit partners and local organizations offered virtual volunteer experiences that provided safe social distancing options while still enabling us to make an impact including card and gift showers for the residents and staff of senior living residences and homebound elderly citizens mentoring and reading delivering food to veterans and elderly citizens contributing food and school supplies collecting and delivering toys cleaning beaches and providing other needed support in their communities we also offer an annual “there’s no place like home” scholarship contest awarding scholarships for higher learning to residents associates and community members

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic including those relating to the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties one of the most significant risks and uncertainties to our financial condition and results of operations is the potential adverse effect of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team with the strategic counsel and stewardship of our board of directors allow us to effectively monitor manage and ultimately mitigate these risks we have created an internal task force to closely monitor the progression of covid19 and related developments this team led by our senior management follows the guidance of local state and national officials as well as the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization as the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and the task force provides regular updates to our board of directors we have implemented a host of measures in response to the pandemic including modifying the workplace and adopting new business practices to align with health protocols and changing operational realities see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — covid19” as the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt business activity our board of directors plays a critical role by guiding and supporting management as they adapt our operations in response to the pandemic and ensuring that the company positions itself to emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient further we seek to maximize revenue collections through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing automated clearing house which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the collection of a majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month 

our operations are also highly dependent upon information systems that support our business processes cyber intrusions could seriously compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen in the face of everchanging and increasing cyber threats our board of directors is wellpositioned to guide management in the development of an effective cybersecurity risk program for our company the board or its audit committee typically meets no less often than semiannually with senior information technology personnel to discuss recent trends in cyber risks and reviews our strategy to defend our business systems and information against cyber attacks

effective systems and technology are essential components of our business we have made significant investments in our lease management construction management property and corporate accounting and asset management systems these systems have been designed to be scalable to accommodate continued growth in our portfolio of singlefamily homes for lease our website is fully integrated into our resident accounting and leasing system from our website which is accessible from mobile devices prospective residents can browse homes available for lease take virtual tours request additional information and apply to lease a specific home through online resident portals and native mobile applications existing residents can set up automatic payments and request maintenance service our system is designed to handle the accounting requirements of residential property accounting including accounting for security deposits and paying propertylevel expenses the system also interfaces with our third party resident screening vendor partner to expedite evaluations of prospective residents’ rental applications we have worked with a search engine optimization firm to ensure we place high in search engine results and will continue to monitor our placement on search engines in addition sponsored key words are generally purchased in selected markets as needed 

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and leasing our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other reits that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs and landscaping expenses during the summer season

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations moreover many risk factors set forth in this annual report on form 10k have been heightened as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

pandemics such as the current covid19 pandemic and outbreaks of infectious disease may adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the ongoing covid19 outbreak in the united states has led entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as certain states and cities including those in which we own properties and where our principal places of business are located to impose and continue to implement measures intended to control the spread of covid19 including instituting quarantines restrictions on travel “shelter in place” rules and restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate we depend on rental revenues and other property income from residents for substantially all of our revenues the covid19 outbreak as well as continuing measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors to limit the spread of this virus or mitigate its impact are interfering with the ability of some of our residents to meet their lease obligations and make their rent payments on time or at all 

in addition entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as some state and local jurisdictions across the united states have imposed temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents are allowing residents to defer missed rent payments without incurring late fees and are prohibiting rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to increase rents while such measures are likely to enable residents to stay in their homes despite an inability to pay because of financial or other hardship stemming from the pandemic they are likely to continue to result in loss of rental income and other property income we cannot predict if states municipalities local andor national authorities will expand existing restrictions if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire 

additionally covid19 and related containment measures may also continue to interfere with the ability of our associates suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks or supply materials services or funding in the case of our revolving facility see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business 

business continuity and disaster recovery issues which may result from the current covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic could materially interrupt our business operations in accordance with phased reopening guidelines and the ongoing spread of covid19 cases in certain states where we operate the majority of our associates based at our headquarters and local offices continue working remotely an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business 

a significant outbreak of infectious disease in the human population or pandemic may result and the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate our business and on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to among other factors 

• demand for singlefamily rental properties decreasing substantially andor occupancy decreasing materially 

• inability of our residents to meet their lease obligations has reduced and may continue to reduce our cash flows and the resulting impact on rental and other property income could impact our ability to make all required debt service payments and to continue paying dividends to our stockholders at expected levels or at all for example our securitized financings require that monthly cash collections from their respective property collateral pools be controlled by the servicer until monthly debt service payments and property management fees are paid and escrow reserves are funded so long as we remain in compliance with certain covenants contained in the underlying loan agreements after such monthly payments are made the servicer releases all residual net cash flow to us this residual net cash flow represents a material portion of our cash flows if the property collateral pools experience higher rates of resident defaults or delinquencies these covenants may not be achieved this would result in the servicer holding all residual net cash flow from any collateral pool that does not meet the covenant requirements net of a monthly funding to us for budgeted operating expenses in blocked collateral accounts for the benefit of the securitized lender rather than being made available to us our lack of access to the net cash flow from securitized collateral pools could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

• a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect 1 our ability to acquire or dispose of singlefamily homes on terms that are attractive or at all and 2 the value of our homes and our business such that we may recognize impairment on the carrying value of our investments in singlefamily residential properties and other assets subject to impairment review including but not limited to goodwill 

• difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms or at all impacts to our credit ratings and a severe disruption of andor instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations including acquisitions or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis 

• the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our credit facility see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” and other debt agreements and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness which noncompliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving facility or to exercise extension options on our mortgage loans and our credit facility 

• a deterioration in our ability to operate in affected areas or delays in the supply of products or services by vendors that are needed for our efficient operations and 

• the potential negative consequences for the health of our associates particularly if a significant number of them are impacted could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during this disruption 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our operations depends on ongoing developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the extent and duration of actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact the availability of an effective vaccine and therapeutic drugs and the effectiveness of the distribution of any such vaccines and therapeutic drugs and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic containment measures monetary andor fiscal policies implemented to provide support or relief to businesses andor residents and other government regulatory andor legislative changes precipitated by the covid19 pandemic among others 

the ongoing development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic nevertheless the covid19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and performance while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our results of operations there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate in many cases heightened as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 

• changes in national regional or local economic demographic or real estate market conditions 

• changes in job markets and employment levels on a national regional and local basis 

• declines in the value of residential real estate 

• overall conditions in the housing market including 

• macroeconomic shifts in demand for rental homes 

• inability to lease or release homes to residents on a timely basis on attractive terms or at all 

• failure of residents to pay rent when due or otherwise perform their lease obligations 

• unanticipated repairs capital expenditures weather related damages or other costs 

• uninsured damages and 

• increases in property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs 

• level of competition for suitable rental homes 

• terms and conditions of purchase contracts 

• costs and time period required to convert acquisitions to rental homes 

• changes in interest rates and availability of financing that may render the acquisition of any homes difficult or unattractive 

• the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

• changes in laws including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates see “— tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability” 

• the impact of potential reforms relating to governmentsponsored enterprises involved in the home finance and mortgage markets 

• rules regulations andor policy initiatives by government and private actors including hoas to discourage or deter the purchase of singlefamily properties by entities owned or controlled by institutional investors 

• disputes and potential negative publicity in connection with eviction proceedings 

• construction of new supply 

• costs resulting from the cleanup of and liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems such as indoor mold 

• fraud by borrowers originators andor sellers of mortgage loans 

• undetected deficiencies andor inaccuracies in underlying mortgage loan documentation and calculations 

• casualty or condemnation losses 

• the geographic mix of our properties 

• the cost quality and condition of the properties we are able to acquire and 

• our ability to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance 

any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly 

we have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

• our ability to effectively manage renovation maintenance marketing and other operating costs for our properties 

• economic conditions in our markets including changes in employment and household earnings and expenses as well as the condition of the financial and real estate markets and the economy in general 

• our ability to maintain high occupancy rates and target rent levels 

• the availability of and our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment strategy 

• our ability to compete with other investors entering the singlefamily rental industry 

• costs that are beyond our control including title litigation litigation with residents or tenant organizations legal compliance property taxes hoa fees and insurance 

• judicial and regulatory developments affecting landlordtenant relations that may affect or delay our ability to dispossess or evict occupants or increase rental rates 

• reversal of population employment or homeownership trends in our markets and 

• interest rate levels and volatility which may affect the accessibility of shortterm and longterm financing on desirable terms 

in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of over 80000 homes as of december 31 2020 our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 

• stabilize and manage an increasing number of properties and resident relationships across our geographically dispersed portfolio while maintaining a high level of resident satisfaction and building and enhancing our brand 

• identify and supervise a number of suitable third parties on which we rely to provide certain services outside of property management to our properties 

• attract integrate and retain new management and operations personnel and 

• continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting procedures and systems 

we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as property taxes hoa fees insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

we recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we recorded consolidated net losses for the year ended december 31 2018 these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may record net losses in future periods 

we are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel 

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or our labor costs increase significantly our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also result in demand for singlefamily rental properties decreasing substantially andor occupancy decreasing materially see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future additionally a significant outbreak of infectious disease in the human population or pandemic may result and the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship additionally covid19 and related containment measures may also continue to interfere with the ability of our associates suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks or supply materials services or funding at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our singlefamily properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for 

government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

• improvements in the overall economy and employment levels 

• greater availability of consumer credit 

• improvements in the pricing and terms of mortgages 

• the emergence of increased competition for singlefamily properties from private investors and entities with similar investment objectives to ours and 

• tax or other government incentives that encourage homeownership 

additionally a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions resulting from covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our ability to acquire or dispose of singlefamily homes on terms that are attractive or at all see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety 

of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including affordability covenants permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions renovations or dispositions result in significant costs delays or losses and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations additionally state and local agencies may place affordability covenants on certain properties to ensure that they are used to provide affordable housing for persons or families of lower income if any of our properties contain affordability covenants recorded in their chains of title we will be forced to sell such properties at a maximum price limit as calculated per the applicable affordable housing covenant which will likely result in us having to sell such properties below their market values we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions renovations or dispositions or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs or losses our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability 

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

for example in 2019 the state of california passed the tenant protection act of 2019 a rent control law which limits our ability to increase rental rates for existing residents and put into place protections for the terminations of tenancies we believe this law negatively affects our rental income from certain of the 12198 homes we own in california as of december 31 2020 

the covid19 pandemic in the united states has led entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as certain states and cities including those in which we own properties and where our principal places of business are located to impose and continue to implement measures intended to control the spread of covid19 including instituting quarantines restrictions on travel “shelter in place” rules and restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as some state and local jurisdictions across the united states have imposed temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents are allowing residents to defer missed rent payments without incurring late fees and are prohibiting rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to increase rents while such measures are likely to enable residents to stay in their homes despite an inability to pay because of financial or other hardship stemming from the pandemic they are likely to continue to result in loss of rental income and other property income we cannot predict if states municipalities local andor national authorities will expand existing restrictions if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

we may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosurerelated issues and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership some of these organizations may shift their litigation lobbying fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlordresident issues while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our business is subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters such as privacy data protection personal information rights of publicity content marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection and online payment services these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently additionally as we depend on third parties for key services see “— our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform” we rely on such third party service providers’ 

compliance with laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters relating to our customers 

there are a number of legislative proposals at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business we are subject to numerous complex and frequently changing laws regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect personal information various federal and state privacy and data security laws such as the california consumer privacy act and nevada privacy law or other regulatory standards create data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we also make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as hvac roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

we have entered into a multiyear contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale accordingly the inability or unwillingness of this vendor to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer 

we rely on the systems of our third party service providers their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform our work a failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally covid19 and related containment measures may also continue to interfere with the ability of our associates suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks or supply materials services or funding at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers may reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer in the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets as a result we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in “as is” condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home the holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property or others who are illegally in possession securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and timeconsuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation 

allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk since we may not have obtained title insurance policies for properties we acquired through the auction process such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance if an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly may not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and title insurance protection may not be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we 

are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in this manner we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than singlefamily home acquisitions and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully the costs involved in locating and performing due diligence when feasible on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable in addition a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio 

moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and lease such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid property tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities which we may be obligated to pay but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be 

subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and the lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this option will necessarily be available or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may lease their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs from lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from leasing such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties several states have enacted laws that provide that a lien for unpaid monies owed to an hoa may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties such actions if not cured may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on us 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we are subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

vacant properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another we may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longer than assumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs and opportunity costs from lost revenues 

the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could negatively affect the ability of our residents to meet their lease obligations resulting in an increased number of residents not renewing their leases we may not be able to promptly release properties that are vacant or become vacant because residents decide not to renew their leases or for other reasons and the rental rates or other terms under new leases may be less favorable than the terms of the current leases see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

vacant homes may also be at risk for fraudulent activity which could impact our ability to lease a home as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues incur additional operating expenses and capital expenditures and our homes could be substantially impaired all of which may have a material adverse effect on us 

we rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening vendor partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity we make leasing decisions based on information in rental applications completed by a prospective resident and screened by our third party partner and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate additionally these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our 

properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them additionally the covid19 outbreak as well as continuing measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors to limit the spread of this virus or mitigate its impact are interfering with the ability of some of our residents to meet their lease obligations and make their rent payments on time or at all furthermore entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as some state and local jurisdictions across the united states have imposed temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents are allowing residents to defer missed rent payments without incurring late fees and are prohibiting rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to increase rents see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home alternatively to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year we may lose the opportunity to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires 

many factors impact the singlefamily rental market and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations our income and distributable cash could decline 

the success of our business model depends in part on conditions in the singlefamily rental market in which we operate a significant outbreak of infectious disease in the human population or pandemic may result and the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition one of the direct impacts on our results of operations and key operating metrics is a decrease in gross rental revenues and other property income before concessions and bad debt due to the restrictions on rent increases imposed in certain jurisdictions in response to the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also have material and adverse effect on demand for singlefamily rental properties andor occupancy levels see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” our investment strategy is based on assumptions about occupancy levels rental rates interest rates and other factors and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate our cash flows and profitability may be reduced multiple economic and demographic factors may contribute to increases or decreases in homeownership rates resulting in fluctuating rental rates and average occupancy levels in addition we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets and convert them to productive uses the supply of singlefamily rental properties will decrease which may increase competition for residents limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties a softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability 

we may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

renters impose additional risks to owning real property renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property accordingly renters may damage a property and its contents and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all a rental property may need repairs andor improvements after each resident vacates the premises the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased accordingly the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also lead to a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect the value of our homes and our business such that we may recognize impairment on the carrying value of our investments in singlefamily residential properties and other assets subject to impairment review including but not limited to goodwill see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes including marketing leasing vendor communications finance intercompany communications our resident portals and property management service platforms which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information 

technology and infrastructure are subject and may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions due to the nature of some of the attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and implemented processes procedures and internal controls that are designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber incidents or security breaches any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings misstated or unreliable financial data liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems business continuity and disaster recovery issues which may result from the current covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic could materially interrupt our business operations in accordance with phased reopening guidelines and the ongoing spread of covid19 cases in certain states where we operate the majority of our associates based at our headquarters and local offices continue working remotely an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity these joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed in addition we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control such actions could among other things impact our ability to maintain our status as a reit further investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our third party partners or coventurers 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in a range of legal and regulatory proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal and regulatory proceedings may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims these actions can be timeconsuming and expensive and may adversely affect our reputation for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind hail pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity fires or wind andor flood risk while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur casualty losses that are not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position in the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes wind or floods may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss of income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area 

when we have geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe such as an earthquake especially in california or destructive weather event such as a hurricane affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next we have in the past and may in the future incur losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather for example uninsured losses and damages related to hurricanes irma and harvey totaled 80 million for the year ended december 31 2018 

climate change may adversely affect our business 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather andor changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations 

eminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back stock 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could also have material and adverse effects on our ability to sell our properties see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

we are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors with respect to the social and environmental impact of our business which may adversely impact our business and ability to raise capital from such investors 

in recent years certain investors have placed increasing importance on the implications of our business with respect to esg matters investors’ increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may constrain our business operations in addition investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the esg factors 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms and 7 the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures if the income from a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could have material and adverse effect on our residents’ ability to meet their lease obligations thereby reducing our cash flows and the resulting impact on rental and other property income could impact our ability to make all required debt service payments and to continue paying dividends to our stockholders at expected levels or at all see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 80805 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

our access to additional third party sources of financing will depend in part on 

• general market conditions 

• the market’s perception of our growth potential 

• with respect to acquisition financing the market’s perception of the value of the homes to be acquired 

• our current debt levels 

• our current and expected future earnings 

• our cash flow and cash distributions and 

• the market price of our common stock 

potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing consequently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms if at all the covid19 pandemic or a future pandemic could result in difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms or at all have material and adverse impacts to our credit ratings and lead to a severe disruption of andor instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions which may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations including acquisitions or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring secured mortgage indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder andor the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt andor otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default a default under one of our debt agreements could result in a crossdefault under other debt agreements and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable terminate their commitments require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral in accordance with our facility agreements is not available 

for example our mortgage loans and secured term loan see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash in such cash management account as the lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans 

the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our credit facility and other debt agreements and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness which noncompliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving facility or to exercise extension options on our mortgage loans and our credit facility see “— our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by pandemics and outbreaks of infectious disease particularly the ongoing covid19 pandemic” 

these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification in order to generate cash for funding new investments mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings for example accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities and possible changes in accounting rules interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets as well as the debt markets and the economy generally have caused significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgagebacked securities as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets including a 

significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 convertible notes or to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes upon a fundamental change our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 convertible notes 

holders of the 2022 convertible notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” have the right to require us to repurchase their 2022 convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change such as certain change in control transactions or recapitalization transactions as defined in the indentures governing the 2022 convertible notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes unless we elect to deliver solely common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 convertible notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 convertible notes surrendered therefor or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes in addition our ability to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by future agreements governing our indebtedness the failure to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the 2022 convertible notes indenture or to pay any cash due and payable on the 2022 convertible notes as required by the 2022 convertible notes indentures would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the 2022 convertible notes indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 convertible notes or make cash payments thereon 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes is triggered holders will be entitled to convert the 2022 convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their 2022 convertible notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

under gaap an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion such as the 2022 convertible notes in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is recorded as a fair value adjustment to the debt component of the 2022 convertible notes the adjustment is treated like a discount for accounting purposes and is amortized into interest expense over the term of the 2022 convertible notes using an effective interest method as a result we will initially be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense because of the amortization of fair value 

adjustment to the 2022 convertible notes’ face amount over the term of the 2022 convertible notes accordingly we will report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period’s amortization of the fair value adjustment and the 2022 convertible notes’ coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2022 convertible notes 

under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the 2022 convertible notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the “ifconverted” method the effect of which is that the shares of common stock contingently issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent that the conversion value of convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount under the “ifconverted” method for diluted earnings per share purposes convertible debt instruments are accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in stock are issued if such calculation is dilutive to earnings per share for the relevant periods this could adversely affect our reported financial results including our diluted earnings per share 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments totaling 63373 million as of december 31 2020 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” for more information each 100 bps increase or decrease on our floating rate indebtedness would result in an estimated increase of 57 million or 158 million respectively in annual interest expense a 100 bps decrease in the london interbank offered rate “libor” results in a negative libor rate and additional interest expense for us our variable rate loan agreements contain libor floors and there is no reciprocal feature in our interest rate swap agreements 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items — complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities” 

expected phasing out of libor may adversely affect the capital markets and our ability to raise capital when libor is discontinued our variable rate debt agreements and financial instruments may be calculated using another base rate 

on november 30 2020 the financial conduct authority of the united kingdom the “fca” which has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor announced that subject to confirmation following its consultation with the administrator of libor it would cease publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 as of december 31 2020 we had 63373 million of variable rate debt outstanding that references one month libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount and for which maturities extend past 2021 assuming all extensions are exercised if libor is discontinued after 2021 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the agreement and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously recorded transactions and may impact our existing transaction data operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest expense libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborbased securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us and on our overall financial condition or results of operations additionally debt holders or governing bodies may decide to transition to a successor rate prior to the expected libor phaseout date 

risks related to our organization structure and ownership of our common stock 

provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control 

certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their shares of common stock including 

• “business combination” provisions that subject to certain exceptions and limitations prohibit certain business combinations between a maryland corporation and an “interested stockholder” defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who at any time within the twoyear period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding shares of stock or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations unless among other conditions our common stockholders receive a minimum price as defined in the mgcl for their shares of stock and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares of stock and 

• “control share” provisions that provide that subject to certain exceptions holders of “control shares” defined as voting shares that when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a “control share acquisition” defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding “control shares” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer by our officers or by our employees who are also directors of our company 

we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl and any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl in addition pursuant to a provision in our bylaws we opted out of the control share provisions of the mgcl provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the mgcl or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in each 

case without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

in addition the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thencurrent market price our charter provides that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we may not elect to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8 including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director 

our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock including preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 

our charter permits our board of directors without any action by our stockholders to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences conversion and other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock which rights may be superior to those of our common stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of stock over the then current market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indenture governing the 2022 convertible notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

certain provisions in the 2022 convertible notes and the related indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change holders of the 2022 convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2022 convertible notes in cash in addition if a takeover constitutes a makewhole fundamental change we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2022 convertible notes in connection with such takeover in either case and in other cases our obligations under the 2022 convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law under current maryland law and our charter our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

• actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money property or services or 

• active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action adjudicated 

our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities in addition we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our 

directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests 

our charter contains a provision that expressly permits our nonemployee directors certain of our preipo owners and their affiliates to compete with us 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates other than to those directors who are employed by us or our subsidiaries unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director and none of our preipo owners or any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law each of our nonemployee directors and any of their affiliates may 

• acquire hold and dispose of interests in us andor our subsidiaries including shares of our stock or common units of partnership interest in invh lp for his her or its own account or for the account of others and exercise all of the rights of a stockholder of invitation homes inc or a limited partner of invh lp to the same extent and in the same manner as if he she or it were not our director or stockholder and 

• in his her or its personal capacity or in his her or its capacity as applicable as a director officer trustee stockholder partner member equity owner manager advisor or employee of any other person have business interests and engage directly or indirectly in business activities that are similar to ours or compete with us that involve a business opportunity that we could seize and develop or that include the acquisition syndication holding management development operation or disposition of interests in mortgages real property or persons engaged in the real estate business 

our charter also provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law in the event that any of our nonemployee directors or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and may take any such opportunity for itself himself or herself or offer it to another person or entity unless the business opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as our director these provisions may limit our ability to pursue business or investment opportunities that we might otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

we have elected to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets or reduce such distributions if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt 

covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for united states federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their stock a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s stock they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items 

if we do not maintain our qualification as a reit we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability 

we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the code we could fail to meet various compliance requirements which could jeopardize our reit status furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year then 

• we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation which under current laws among other things means being unable to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income and being subject to united states federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates 

• any resulting tax liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our book value 

• unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we would be required to pay taxes and thus our cash available for distribution to stockholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a reit and for which we had taxable income 

• we could be subject to increased state and local taxes and 

• we generally would not be eligible to requalify as a reit for the subsequent four full taxable years 

reits in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may become subject to united states federal income taxes and related state and local taxes for example net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a reit a “prohibited transaction” under the code will be subject to a 100 tax we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits similarly if we were to fail an income test and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file united states federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property including income franchise payroll mortgage recording and transfer taxes either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets such as our trss which are subject to full united states federal state local and foreign corporatelevel income taxes any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

in order to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences in addition to the quarterly asset test requirements we must annually satisfy two income test requirements the “75 and 95 gross income tests” as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders we may be unable to pursue investments that would otherwise be advantageous to it in order to satisfy the income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a “borrowings hedge” or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income each such hedge a “currency hedge” if clearly identified under applicable united states treasury “treasury” regulations does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit this exclusion from the 95 and 75 gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a borrowings hedge or a currency hedge a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses from hedges held in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs provided however losses in our trs arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 may only be carried forward and may only be deducted against 80 of future taxable income in the trs 

complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 

from time to time our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the code thus we could be required to borrow funds sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative these options could increase our costs or reduce our equity 

even if we qualify to be subject to united states federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo reorganization transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to united states federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the builtin gain tax however there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares of stock whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future and any decision to grant a waiver from the ownership limit in any particular instance is at the sole discretion of our board of directors any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends 

in connection with our qualification as a reit we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain in order to satisfy this requirement we may make distributions that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock which could account for up to 90 of the aggregate amount of such distributions at the election of each stockholder taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes as a result united states stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received accordingly united states holders receiving a distribution of our stock may be required to sell stocks received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a united states stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to certain nonunited states holders we may be required to withhold united states tax with respect to such distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service “irs” will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cashstock distributions including on a retroactive basis or assert that the requirements for such taxable cashstock distributions have not been met 

dividends payable by reits do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable by nonreit c corporations to certain noncorporate united states stockholders is currently 238 taking into account the 38 medicare tax applicable to net investment income dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 those noncorporate united states stockholders may deduct 20 of their dividends from reits excluding qualified dividend income and capital gains dividends for those united states stockholders in the top marginal tax bracket of 37 the deduction for reit dividends yields an effective income tax rate of 296 on reit dividends which is higher than the 238 tax rate on qualified dividend income paid by nonreit c corporations although the legislation benefits the taxation of reits and dividends payable by reits the more favorable rates applicable to nonreit corporate qualified dividends could cause certain noncorporate investors to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including our common stock 

we are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth 

as with other reits but unlike corporations generally our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90 of our reit taxable income in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of united states federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock for example the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” has resulted in fundamental changes to the code among the 

numerous changes included in the tcja is a deduction of 20 of ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 through 2025 we cannot assure you that the tcja or any such changes in the future will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of the tcja on your investment in our stock and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 

to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory 

our ownership of and relationship with any trs will be restricted and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our reit status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax 

a reit may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more trss a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than 20 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss the value of our interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a trs may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 as amended a trs will pay united states federal state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis 

any trs we own as a domestic corporation will pay united states federal state and local income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us the aggregate value of the trs stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets including the trs stock and securities although we plan to monitor our investments in trss there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20 limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above 

recharacterization of leases as financing transactions may negatively affect us 

while we generally intend to use reasonable commercial efforts to structure any lease transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” with us treated as the owner and lessor of the property for federal income tax purposes the irs could challenge such characterization in the event that any lease transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a sellerfinanced conditional sale transaction for federal income tax purposes deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed in addition if we enter such transactions at the reit level in the event of recharacterization the reit could be subject to prohibited transaction taxes finally the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year and require us to pay deficiency dividends interest and penalty taxes in order to maintain reit status

overview 

invitation homes is a leading owner and operator of singlefamily homes for lease offering residents highquality homes in soughtafter neighborhoods across america with over 80000 homes for lease in 16 markets across the country as of december 31 2020 invitation homes is meeting changing lifestyle demands by providing residents access to updated homes with features they value such as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools our mission statement “together with you we make a house a home” reflects our commitment to hightouch service that continuously enhances residents’ living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive 

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeast united states through disciplined market and asset selection as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes 

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior noi growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental markets within our 16 markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately 1870 square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand the infill locations and high quality of our homes and service further differentiate our resident experience which we continue to refine 

covid19 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on global and united states economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and disruption in financial markets the ultimate impacts remain unknown but could include the potential worsening of global and united states economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets consumer spending and the market for acquisition and disposition of singlefamily homes as well as other unanticipated consequences as such we are closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our business including operating investment management and capital markets activities 

with the safety and wellbeing of our residents and associates being our highest priority we continue to follow protocols that enable teams to safely continue providing outstanding service to residents the safety and service measures currently in place include 1 creating and implementing a safety training program for all associates 2 maintaining a threemonth supply of masks gloves shoe covers and hand sanitizer for field teams 3 continuing to leverage selfshow and virtualtour technology as both safety measures and competitive advantages 4 adhering to strict safety protocols for maintenance service trips and 5 adapting to offer virtual options for resident movein orientations and premoveout visits 

neither these procedural adjustments nor the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic created significant disruptions to our business model during the year ended december 31 2020 however the pandemic did impact our business including operating investment management and capital markets activities as more fully described below 

operations 

the direct impacts on our results of operations and key operating metrics from the effects of the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to 1 a decrease in gross rental revenues and other property income before concessions and bad debt due to jurisdictional restrictions on rent increases and late fees andor forgiveness of late fees for residents who have requested leniency 2 an increase in occupancy due to lower turnover partially driven by residents’ decisions not to relocate during the pandemic strong demand for homes that become vacant and the impact of eviction moratoriums 3 an increase in uncollectible revenues or decline in rent collections percentages due to resident hardships and eviction moratoriums and 4 a decrease in property operating and maintenance expenses for turnover costs lower turnover rates and property administrative fees eviction moratoriums 

in march 2020 to act on our core values of genuine care and standout citizenship we began to offer solutions for residents experiencing financial hardship when requested including the ongoing creation of payment plans without late fees for residents requiring flexibility to meet rental obligations over time additionally we continue to adhere to federal state and local restrictions on items such as evictions collections rent increases and late fees as appropriate 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak in the united states has led entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as certain states and cities including those in which we own properties and where our principal places of business are located to impose and continue to implement measures intended to control the spread of covid19 including instituting quarantines restrictions on travel “shelter in place” rules and restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate we depend on rental revenues and other property income from residents for substantially all of our revenues overall revenue collections as a percentage of monthly billings was 96 for the period from april 2020 through december 2020 compared to a historical average of 99 while collection of revenues has remained near historical levels thus far through the pandemic the covid19 outbreak as well as continuing measures taken by governmental authorities and private actors to limit the spread of this virus or mitigate its impact are interfering with the ability of some of our residents to meet their lease obligations and make their rent payments on time or at all in addition entities directed by or notionally affiliated with the federal government as well as some state and local jurisdictions across the united states have imposed temporary eviction moratoriums if certain criteria are met by residents are allowing residents to defer missed rent payments without incurring late fees and are prohibiting rent increases jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to increase rents we cannot predict if states municipalities local andor national authorities will expand existing restrictions if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions or when restrictions currently in place will expire such measures are likely to enable residents to stay in their homes despite an inability to pay because of financial or other hardship stemming from the pandemic 

certain other restrictions imposed by jurisdictions across the united states are intended to limit operations by businesses not deemed “essential businesses” while none of the current restrictions have materially impacted our ability to provide services to our residents or homes future measures may negatively impact our ability to access our homes complete service requests or make our homes ready for new residents unless the residents report symptoms of or exposure to covid19 we are completing all service calls in all cases we work with the residents to ensure service requests are addressed in a timely and safe manner 

while covid19 and related containment measures may interfere with the ability of our associates suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks or to supply materials and services at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business in the future to date we have not experienced significant disruptions of these types 

the majority of our officebased associates continue to work from home and will do so until we determine it is in our and their best interests to fully return to our offices additionally changes to the working environment have not had a material effect on our internal controls over financial reporting since the pandemic began see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” for additional information 

investment management 

we continue to successfully source and effectuate compelling acquisition and disposition opportunities since the pandemic began we have continued to sell homes identified for disposition we are also now acquiring new homes at a precovid19 pace after pausing activity from midmarch through may and entered into a joint venture partnership with rockpoint group llc “rockpoint” despite this recent activity our ability to acquire or dispose of properties could be impaired by local rules and ordinances that could be put in place to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic and a general decline in economic and business activity could adversely affect the singlefamily residential housing market and our ability to acquire and dispose of homes 

joint venture with rockpoint 

on october 6 2020 we entered into an agreement with rockpoint to form a joint venture partnership to acquire singlefamily homes to operate as rental residences the joint venture will be capitalized with a total equity commitment of 3750 million of which 750 million 20 has been committed by us and 3000 million 80 has been committed by rockpoint a total of over 10 billion including debt is expected to be deployed by the joint venture to acquire and renovate singlefamily homes in attractive locations in markets within the western united states southeast united states florida and texas where we already own homes the homes are expected to be of similarly high quality and similar characteristics to the homes in our existing portfolio 

we will provide asset and property management services to the joint venture for which we will earn asset management and property management fees and we have the opportunity to earn a promoted interest subject to certain performance thresholds 

the joint venture is anticipated to have a five to eight year term with certain sale rights in favor of each member but has the flexibility to continue owning homes for an unlimited period of time if neither member triggers a sale upon trigger of a sale by rockpoint or us the other member of the joint venture will have a right of first offer to acquire the homes proposed for sale 

we also maintain the ability in all markets to continue deploying capital from our own balance sheet to acquire homes for our portfolio concurrent with the joint venture’s deployment of capital in markets where we and the joint venture are investing concurrently our investment personnel will source acquisitions without knowledge of which entity will acquire the homes and upon being approved for close homes will be allocated on a rotational basis between us and the joint venture according to predetermined ratios of investment between the two entities in addition we maintain the right to enter into portfolio acquisitions of ten or more homes outside of the joint venture 

capital markets and financing 

to date our access to capital markets has not been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in june 2020 we successfully issued and sold 167 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 4475 million to provide capital primarily for acquisition opportunities we also entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement that provides 35000 million of borrowing capacity and consists of a 10000 million revolving facility and a 25000 million term loan facility see “ — liquidity and capital resources” for additional information regarding the new credit facility including significant changes in terms and provisions from our prior credit facility and a description of the use of proceeds we continue to make scheduled debt service payments including full repayment of the 2700 million revolving credit facility balance that had been drawn in march and do not anticipate noncompliance with our key affirmative and negative debt covenants as of december 31 2020 we have 12134 million in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility see “ — liquidity and capital resources” for additional information that said a severe disruption of andor instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations including acquisitions or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis 

ongoing considerations 

the situation surrounding the ongoing covid19 pandemic remains fluid and the ensuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our rental revenues and other property income in particular cannot be fully be determined at present due to an inability to estimate actual collection rates occupancy levels and expiration of temporary restrictions on evictions collections rent increases and late fees we will continue to actively manage our response in collaboration with our residents and business partners and to assess potential impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as potential adverse developments in our business 

in addition to the foregoing uncertainties we are unable to predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties regarding external factors these uncertainties include the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the extent and duration of actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact the availability of an effective vaccine and therapeutic drugs and the effectiveness of the distribution of any such vaccines and therapeutic drugs and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic containment measures monetary andor fiscal policies implemented to provide support or relief to businesses andor residents and other government regulatory andor legislative changes precipitated by the covid19 pandemic among others for further information regarding the impact of covid19 on our company see part i item 1a “risk factors”

factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control see part i item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals rental rates and occupancy levels turnover rates and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance property acquisitions and renovations and financing arrangements sensitivity to many of these factors has been heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of covid19 

market fundamentals our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 713 of our rental revenues and other property income during the year ended december 31 2020 we are actively monitoring the impact of the covid19 outbreak on market fundamentals and are quickly implementing changes in pricing as market fundamentals shift 

rental rates and occupancy levels rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years the ongoing covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to increase rents and may impact our ability to maintain occupancy levels 

collection rates our rental revenues and other property income is impacted by the rate at which we collect such revenues from our residents we routinely work with residents facing financial hardships who need flexibility to fulfill their lease obligations but the ongoing covid19 pandemic has increased the number of such residents when requested we work with these residents to create payment plans without late fees and then actively manage these receivables however a portion of these amounts may not ultimately be collected any amounts billed to residents that have been deemed uncollectible along with our estimate of amounts that may ultimately be uncollectible decrease our rental revenues and other property income 

turnover rates and days to reresident other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents resident turnover rates and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property which is a component of the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory and both current economic conditions and future economic outlook both of which are impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic days to reresident may be negatively affected by homes potentially remaining vacant while prospective residents remain in their current housing our turnover rate may be affected by the current covid19 pandemic as a result of delayed eviction proceedings andor move outs potentially being canceled by residents who have not secured their next housing plans increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period of vacancy 

property improvements and maintenance property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

while the covid19 outbreak has required us to modify our property improvement and maintenance procedures to accommodate resident preferences as a currently designated “essential business” we are completing all maintenance work orders unless a resident reports symptoms of or exposure to covid19 however future potential governmental measures may restrict our ability to function as an “essential business” additionally we have addressed a backlog of deferred work orders that resulted from our initial deferral of all nonemergency work orders at the onset of the pandemic 

property acquisitions and renovations future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets all of these factors may be negatively impacted by the covid19 outbreak potentially reducing the number of homes we acquire 

the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental the scope of renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property whether the property was vacant when acquired and whether there are any state or local restrictions on our ability to complete renovations as an essential business function additionally covid19 and related containment measures may interfere with the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks andor source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense mortgage loans secured term loan term loan facility revolving facility and convertible debt as well as our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and certain financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms interest rates are impacted by market conditions and the terms of the underlying financing arrangements inability by our residents to meet their lease obligations due to the covid19 pandemic could reduce our cash flows which could impact our ability to make all required debt service payments furthermore the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the economy and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could negatively affect our ability to access financial markets as well as our business results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations 

components of revenues and expenses 

the following is a description of the components of our revenues and expenses 

revenues 

rental revenues and other property income

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we owned 80177 and 79505 singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we acquired 2252 and 2153 homes respectively and sold 1580 and 3455 homes respectively during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we owned an average of 79530 and 80372 singlefamily rental homes respectively 

we believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of both a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business to do so we provide information regarding the performance of our same store portfolio 

as of december 31 2020 our same store portfolio consisted of 71433 singlefamily rental homes 

rental revenues and other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled 18228 million and 17647 million respectively an increase of 33 driven by an increase in average occupancy average monthly rent per occupied home and utilities reimbursements partially offset by an increase in bad debt reduced fee income and a 842 home decrease between periods in the average number of homes owned 

average occupancy for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 for the total portfolio was 961 and 942 respectively average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 1875 and 1809 respectively a 36 increase for our same store portfolio average occupancy was 975 and 962 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and average monthly rent per occupied home for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 1874 and 1810 respectively a 35 increase 

the annual turnover rate for the same store portfolio for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 261 and 297 respectively for the same store portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 36 and 46 days between residents for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the decreases in these two metrics contributed to our increase in occupancy on a year over year basis furthermore we believe the decrease in turnover is partially attributable to the effects of the covid19 pandemic eg eviction moratoriums and residents who are not inclined to relocate during this period we cannot predict how long eviction moratoriums will remain in place nor when the general effects of the pandemic will subside and how those items may affect our turnover and occupancy rates 

to monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized nonservice concessions to calculate net effective rental rate growth leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home 

renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 37 and 50 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 44 and 38 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for our same store portfolio renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 37 and 50 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 42 and 37 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our rental revenues and other property income in three notable ways 1 lower collection rates which caused our bad debt to increase from 05 of gross rental income for the year ended december 31 2019 to 17 of gross rental income for the year ended december 31 2020 2 voluntary nonenforcement of and jurisdictional restrictions on late fees during a portion of the year ended december 31 2020 which was a primary driver of a decrease in fee income year over year and 3 lower reimbursements of move out and other costs as a result of lower turnover and eviction moratoriums the decreases in fee income and reimbursements were partially offset by continued increases in utilities reimbursements as more utilities remained in our name compared to the prior year 

the covid19 pandemic is likely to continue to affect our collection rates and ability to raise rents and charge fees and the impact of jurisdictional restrictions on rental rates late fees collections and eviction moratoriums is likely to affect our ability to increase rental revenues and other operating income 

expenses 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 total expenses were 17096 million and 17255 million respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2020 property operating and maintenance expense increased to 6805 million from 6700 million for the year ended december 31 2019 this 16 net increase resulted from increases in utilities property taxes and repairs and maintenance partially offset by decreases in turnover property administrative costs that declined due to lower turnover and eviction moratoriums and savings in personnel and other costs the 842 home decrease between periods in the average number of homes owned also offset the increases in certain expense categories the covid19 pandemic is likely to continue to impact our turnover rates and thus turnover costs and other property operating and maintenance expense may continue to be affected by the ongoing impacts of the pandemic 

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased to 1219 million from 1359 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively due to decreases in severance expense of 79 million merger and transactionrelated expenses of 43 million and sharebased compensation expense of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our property management and general and administrative expenses 

interest expense was 3539 million and 3672 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by a decrease in the average debt balance outstanding during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 due to various prepayments subsequent to december 31 2019 and settlement of a portion of our convertible debt for common equity during the year ended 

december 31 2019 debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts decreased to 80315 million as of december 31 2020 from 84675 million as of december 31 2019 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 5525 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from 5337 million for the year ended december 31 2019 due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures this was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

impairment and other expenses were 07 million and 187 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 impairment and other expenses was comprised of impairment losses of 46 million on our singlefamily residential properties partially offset by net gains on casualty losses of 39 million during the year ended december 31 2019 impairment and other expenses was comprised of impairment losses of 142 million on our singlefamily residential properties and casualty losses of 45 million the impairment costs recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 were not a direct result of the covid19 pandemic 

unrealized gains on investments in equity securities 

unrealized gains on investments in equity securities increased to 297 million for the year ended december 31 2020 from 65 million for the year ended december 31 2019 due to the merger of one of our investments with a special purpose acquisition company during the year ended december 31 2020 subsequent to this merger the investment has a readily determinable fair value and has been marked to market 

other net 

other net decreased to a 01 million loss for the year ended december 31 2020 from 51 million of income for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to changes in the components of our miscellaneous income and expenses and a 18 million rou lease asset impairment during the year ended december 31 2020 

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property net of tax was 546 million and 963 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the primary driver of the decrease was a decrease in the number of homes sold from 3455 during the year ended december 31 2019 to 1580 during the year ended december 31 2020 

year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our year ended december 31 2019 results compared to our year ended december 31 2018 results refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 201 9 10k  

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2020 and 2019 include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2134 million and 923 million respectively a 1313 increase the following significant activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2020 

• in december 2020 we entered into a sustainabilitylinked senior unsecured credit facility the “credit facility” that provides 35000 million of borrowing capacity and consists of a 10000 million revolving facility the “revolving facility” and a 25000 million term loan facility the “term loan facility” both of which mature on january 31 2025 with two six month extension options available the credit facility replaced a credit facility that consisted of a 10000 million revolving facility the “2017 revolving facility” and a 15000 million term loan facility the “2017 term loan facility” and together with the 2017 revolving facility the “2017 credit facility” proceeds from the term loan facility were used 1 to fully repay the 15000 million 2017 term loan facility due to mature in february 2022 2 to fully repay the 7310 million principal balance of the swh 20171 securitization that was due to reach final maturity in january 2023 and 3 to voluntarily prepay highercost classes of certificates of various securitizations due to reach final maturity provided all extensions were exercised between march 2025 and january 2026 for both the revolving facility and the term loan facility spreads at closing based on the companys total leverage ratio were 5 bps lower than the spreads most recently in effect for the 2017 credit facility 

• in march 2020 we drew 2500 million on the 2017 revolving facility due to uncertainties about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our cash provided by operations and our nearterm acquisition and disposition activity 

• in may 2020 we used cash on hand to repay 1200 million of the thenoutstanding balance of the 2017 revolving facility 

• in june 2020 we completed an underwritten public offering to sell 16675000 shares of our common stock and generated net proceeds of 4475 million proceeds of 1500 million were used to fully repay the thenoutstanding balance on our 2017 revolving facility the remaining proceeds were used primarily for acquisitions 

as of december 31 2020 our 10000 million revolving facility remains undrawn and there are no restrictions on our ability to draw additional funds thereunder provided we remain in compliance with all covenants we have no debt reaching final maturity until december 2024 provided all extensions are exercised with the exception of 3450 million of convertible notes maturing in january 2022 

our ability to access capital as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the effects of the covid19 pandemic as detailed in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

through december 31 2020 disposition channels remained healthy in our markets and we continued to sell homes that were designated for disposition we have limited cash commitments outside of debt service as we do not engage in any development activity and the pipeline of acquisitions to which we are committed is 309 million as of december 31 2020 however the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic may impact the acquisition and disposition of singlefamily homes in ways that we are unable to predict 

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make dividend payments to our stockholders and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i renovating newlyacquired homes ii funding hoa fees as applicable property taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance of our homes iii interest expense iv payment of dividends to our equity investors and v required contributions to the rockpoint joint venture we believe our rental income net of total expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a nearterm basis 

however the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our operating cash flow such that we are unable to make required debt service payments which would result in an event of default for any such loan agreement under which payments were not made specifically the collateral within individual borrower entities may underperform resulting in cash flow shortfalls for debt service while consolidated cash flows are sufficient to fund our operations if an event of default occurs for a specific mortgage loan or for our secured term loan our loan agreements provide certain remedies including our ability to 

fund shortfalls from consolidated cash flow and such an event of default would not result in an immediate acceleration of the loan 

our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing sources such as the revolving facility which had an undrawn balance of 10000 million as of december 31 2020 

our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal payments on our indebtedness we intend to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

on august 22 2019 we entered into distribution agreements with a syndicate of banks the “agents” pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate sales price of 8000 million of our common stock through the agents the “atm equity program” during the year ended december 31 2020 we sold 8413224 shares of our common stock under our atm equity program generating net proceeds of 2392 million after giving effect to agent commissions and other costs totaling 39 million as of december 31 2020 5000 million remains available for future offerings under the atm equity program 

certain securitizations defined below the secured term loan defined below the term loan facility and the revolving facility collectively the “liborbased loans” use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates our derivative instruments are also indexed to libor on november 30 2020 the fca which has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor announced that subject to confirmation following its consultation with the administrator of libor it would cease publication of the one week and two month usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 once libor is phased out the interest rates for our liborbased loans will be based on a comparable or successor rate as provided for in our loan agreements we will work with the counterparties to our swap and cap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs the ultimate outcome of this change is uncertain at this time and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models 

the following describes the key terms of our current indebtedness 

mortgage loans 

our securitization transactions the “securitizations” or the “mortgage loans” are collateralized by certain homes owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of invh lp that were formed to facilitate certain of our financing arrangements the “borrower entities” we utilize the proceeds from our securitizations to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness ii initial deposits into securitization reserve accounts iii closing costs in connection with the mortgage loans and iv general costs associated with our operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our mortgage loan indebtedness as of december 31 2020 and 2019 





1 maturity date represents repayment date for mortgage loans which have been repaid in full prior to december 31 2020 for all other mortgage loans the maturity dates above reflect all extension options that have been exercised 

2 represents the maturity date if we exercise each of the remaining one year extension options available which are subject to certain conditions being met 

3 except for ih 20171 interest rates are based on a weighted average spread over libor plus applicable servicing fees as of december 31 2020 libor was 014 our ih 20171 mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 423 per annum equal to the market determined passthrough rate payable on the certificates including applicable servicing fees 

4 range of spreads is based on outstanding principal balances as of december 31 2020 

5 outstanding principal balance is net of discounts and does not include deferred financing costs net 

6 net of unamortized discount of 23 million and 26 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

7 the initial maturity term of each of these mortgage loans is two years individually subject to three to five one year extension options at the borrower entity’s discretion provided that there is no continuing event of default under the mortgage loan agreement and the borrower entity obtains and delivers a replacement interest rate cap agreement from an approved counterparty within the required timeframe to the lender our ih 20181 ih 20182 and ih 20183 mortgage loans have exercised the first extension option and our ih 20172 mortgage loan has exercised the second extension option the maturity dates above reflect all extensions that have been exercised 

8 on december 1 2020 we submitted a notification to request an extension of the maturity date of the ih 20181 mortgage loan from march 9 2021 to march 9 2022 

9 on january 9 2021 the extension of the maturity date of the ih 20184 mortgage loan from january 9 2021 to january 9 2022 was approved by the lender 

securitization transactions 

for each securitization transaction the borrower entity executed a loan agreement with a third party lender except for ih 20171 each outstanding mortgage loan originally consisted of six floating rate components the two year initial terms are individually subject to three to five one year extension options at the borrower entity’s discretion such extensions are available provided there is no continuing event of default under the respective mortgage loan agreement and the borrower entity obtains and delivers a replacement interest rate cap agreement from an approved counterparty within the required timeframe to the lender ih 20171 is a 10 year fixed rate mortgage loan comprised of two components certificates issued by the trust in connection with component a of ih 20171 benefit from the federal national mortgage association’s guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest 

each mortgage loan is secured by a pledge of the equity in the assets of the respective borrower entities as well as firstpriority mortgages on the underlying properties and a grant of security interests in all of the related personal property as of december 31 2020 and 2019 a total of 31316 and 37040 homes respectively with a net book value of 57616 million and 71376 million respectively are pledged pursuant to the mortgage loans each borrower entity has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the respective loan agreements to substitute properties we are obligated to make monthly payments of interest for each mortgage loan 

transactions with trusts 

concurrent with the execution of each mortgage loan agreement the respective third party lender sold each loan it originated to individual depositor entities the “depositor entities” who subsequently transferred each loan to securitizationspecific trust entities the “trusts” the depositor entities for our currently outstanding securitizations are wholly owned subsidiaries 

as consideration for the transfer of each loan to the trusts the trusts issued classes of certificates which mirror the components of the individual loans collectively the “certificates” to the depositor entities except that class r certificates do not have related loan components as they represent residual interests in the trusts the certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trusts following receipt of the certificates the depositor entities sold the certificates to investors and used the proceeds as consideration for the loans sold to the depositor entities by the lenders these transactions had no effect on our consolidated financial statements other than with respect to certificates we retained in connection with securitizations or purchased at a later date 

the trusts are structured as passthrough entities that receive interest payments from the securitizations and distribute those payments to the holders of the certificates the assets held by the trusts are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of those entities the obligations of the trusts do not have any recourse to the general credit of any entities in these consolidated financial statements we have evaluated our interests in certain certificates of the trusts held by us discussed below and determined that they do not create a more than insignificant variable interest in the trusts additionally the retained certificates do not provide us with any ability to direct activities that could impact the trusts’ economic performance therefore we do not consolidate the trusts 

retained certificates 

as the trusts made certificates available for sale to both domestic and foreign investors sponsors of the mortgage loans are required to retain a portion of the risk that represents a material net economic interest in each loan pursuant to regulation rr the “risk retention rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as such loan sponsors are required to retain a portion of the credit risk that represents not less than 5 of the aggregate fair value of the loan as of the closing date 

ih 20171 issued class b certificates which are restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to invh lp in order to comply with the risk retention rules the class b certificates bear a stated annual interest rate of 423 including applicable servicing fees 

for swh 20171 ih 20172 ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 we retain 5 of each class of certificates to meet the risk retention rules these retained certificates accrue interest at a floating rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 076 to 205 

the retained certificates total 2452 million and 3170 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and are classified as held to maturity investments and recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets 

loan covenants 

the general terms that apply to all of the mortgage loans require each borrower entity to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants include each borrower entity’s and certain of their respective affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the mortgage loan agreements ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the respective mortgage loan agreements negative covenants include each borrower entity’s and certain of their affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of each 

borrower entity’s indebtedness and the nature of their investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager iv the nature of each borrower entity’s business activities and v the required maintenance of specified cash reserves as of december 31 2020 and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe each borrower entity is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants 

prepayments 

for the mortgage loans prepayments of amounts owed by us are generally not permitted under the terms of the respective mortgage loan agreements unless such prepayments are made pursuant to the voluntary election or mandatory provisions specified in such agreements the specified mandatory provisions become effective to the extent that a property becomes characterized as a disqualified property a property is sold andor upon the occurrence of a condemnation or casualty event associated with a property to the extent either a voluntary election is made or a mandatory prepayment condition exists in addition to paying all interest and principal we must also pay certain breakage costs as determined by the loan servicer and a spread maintenance premium if prepayment occurs before the month following the one or two year anniversary of the closing dates of each of the mortgage loans except for ih 20171 for ih 20171 prepayments on or before december 2026 will require a yield maintenance premium for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we made voluntary and mandatory prepayments of 14346 million 9974 million and 45796 million respectively under the terms of the mortgage loan agreements during the year ended december 31 2020 prepayments included the full repayment of the swh 20171 mortgage loan during the year ended december 31 2019 prepayments included the full repayment of the csh 20162 mortgage loan during the year ended december 31 2018 prepayments included full repayment of the cah 20141 cah 20142 cah 20151 csh 20161 ih 20151 ih 20152 and ih 20153 mortgage loans 

secured term loan 

on june 7 2019 20191 ih borrower lp a consolidated subsidiary “20191 ih borrower” and one of our borrower entities entered into a 12 year loan agreement with a life insurance company the “secured term loan” the secured term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 359 including applicable servicing fees for the first 11 years and bears interest at a floating rate based on a spread of 147 bps including applicable servicing fees over one month libor subject to certain adjustments as outlined in the loan agreement for the twelfth year the secured term loan is secured by first priority mortgages on a portfolio of singlefamily rental properties as well as a first priority pledge of the equity interests of 20191 ih borrower we utilized the proceeds from the secured term loan to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness ii initial deposits into the secured term loan’s reserve accounts iii transaction costs related to the closing of the secured term loan and iv general corporate purposes

collateral 

the secured term loan’s collateral pool contains 3332 and 3333 homes respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 with a net book value of 7198 million and 7348 million respectively 20191 ih borrower has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the loan agreement to substitute properties representing up to 20 of the collateral pool annually and to substitute properties representing up to 100 of the collateral pool over the life of the secured term loan in addition four times after the first anniversary of the closing date 20191 ih borrower has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the loan agreement to execute a special release of collateral representing up to 15 of the thenoutstanding principal balance of the secured term loan in order to bring the loantovalue ratio back in line with the secured term loan’s loantovalue ratio as of the closing date any such special release of collateral would not change the thenoutstanding principal balance of the secured term loan but rather would reduce the number of singlefamily rental homes included in the collateral pool 

loan covenants 

the secured term loan requires 20191 ih borrower to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants include 20191 ih borrower’s and certain of its affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the loan agreement ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the loan agreement negative covenants include 20191 ih borrower’s and certain of its affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of 20191 ih borrower’s indebtedness and the nature of its investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager iv the nature of 20191 ih borrower’s business activities and v the required maintenance of specified cash reserves as of december 31 2020 and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe 20191 ih borrower is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants

term loan facility and revolving facility 

on december 8 2020 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks financial institutions and institutional lenders for the credit facility the credit facility provides 35000 million of borrowing capacity and consists of the 10000 million revolving facility and the 25000 million term loan facility both of which mature on january 31 2025 with two six month extension options available the revolving facility also includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit the credit facility provides us with the option to enter into additional incremental credit facilities including an uncommitted incremental facility that provides us with the option to increase the size of the revolving facility andor the term loan facility such that the aggregate amount does not exceed at any time 40000 million subject to certain limitations 

the credit facility replaced the 2017 credit facility that consisted of the 10000 million 2017 revolving facility and the 15000 million 2017 term loan facility the terms and conditions of the credit facility are consistent with those of the 2017 credit facility unless otherwise noted below proceeds from the term loan facility were used to repay thenoutstanding indebtedness including the 2017 term loan facility proceeds from the revolving facility are used for general corporate purposes 

the following table sets forth a summary of the outstanding principal amounts under the credit facility and 2017 credit facility as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 





1 interest rates for the term loan facility and the revolving facility are based on libor plus an applicable margin as of december 31 2020 the applicable margins were 165 and 170 respectively and libor was 014 

2 if we exercise the two six month extension options the maturity date will be january 31 2026 

interest rate and fees 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a libor rate determined by reference to the bloomberg libor rate or a comparable or successor rate as provided for in our loan agreement for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or b a base rate determined by reference to the highest of 1 the administrative agent’s prime lending rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and 3 the libor rate that would be payable on such day for a libor rate loan with a one month interest period plus 100 the margin is based on a total leverage based grid the margins for the term loan facility revolving facility 2017 term loan facility and 2017 revolving facility are as follows 



in addition the credit facility provides that upon receiving an investment grade rating on its noncredit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt of bbb or better from standard  poor’s rating services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc or baa3 or better from moody’s investors service inc we may elect to convert to a credit rating based pricing grid the margins for the term loan facility and revolving facility under the credit rating based pricing grid are as follows 



the credit facility also includes a sustainability component whereby the revolving facility pricing can improve upon the company’s achievement of certain sustainability ratings determined via an independent third party evaluation this sustainability feature was not included in the 2017 revolving facility 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay an unused facility fee to the lenders under the revolving facility in respect of the unused commitments thereunder the unused facility fee rate is based on the daily unused amount of the revolving facility and is either 030 or 020 per annum based on the unused facility amount the unused facility fee rate for the 2017 revolving facility was 035 or 20 per annum based on the unused facility amount upon conversion to a credit rating pricing based grid the unused facility fee will no longer apply and we will be required to pay a facility fee ranging from 010 to 030 we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees 

prepayments and amortization 

no principal reductions are required under the credit facility we are permitted to voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the term loan facility at any time without premium or penalty subject to certain minimum amounts and the payment of customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans once repaid no further borrowings will be permitted under the term loan facility 

loan covenants 

the credit facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default such covenants will among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability and that of the subsidiary guarantors as defined below and their respective subsidiaries to i engage in certain mergers consolidations or liquidations ii sell lease or transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets iii engage in certain transactions with affiliates iv make changes to our fiscal year v make changes in the nature of our business and our subsidiaries and vi enter into certain burdensome agreements 

the credit facility also requires us on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries to maintain a i maximum total leverage ratio ii maximum secured leverage ratio iii maximum unencumbered leverage ratio iv minimum fixed charge coverage ratio v minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio and vi maximum secured recourse leverage ratio if an event of default occurs the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions including the acceleration of amounts due under the credit facility as of december 31 2020 and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe we were in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants 

guarantees and security 

the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of our direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries that directly own unencumbered assets the “subsidiary guarantors” subject to certain exceptions these guarantees will be automatically released upon the occurrence of certain events including if the applicable subsidiary guarantor is no longer a direct owner of an unencumbered asset in addition invh and each subsidiary of invh that owns equity in the borrower may be required to provide a guarantee of the credit facility under certain circumstances including if invh does not maintain its qualification as a reit 

although the 2017 credit facility was secured such security interests have been released and the credit facility is unsecured 

convertible senior notes 

in connection with the mergers we assumed swh’s convertible senior notes in july 2014 swh issued 2300 million in aggregate principal amount of 300 convertible senior notes due 2019 the “2019 convertible notes” interest on the 2019 convertible notes was payable semiannually in arrears on january 1st and july 1st of each year the notes matured on july 1 2019 and we settled substantially all of the outstanding balance of the 2019 convertible notes through the issuance of 12553864 shares of our common stock

the following table summarizes the terms of the convertible senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 2019 





1 effective rate includes the effect of the adjustment to the fair value of the debt as of the merger date the value of which reduced the initial liability recorded to 3243 million for the 2022 convertible notes 

2 the conversion rate as of december 31 2020 represents the number of shares of common stock issuable per 1000 principal amount actual  of the 2022 convertible notes converted on such date as adjusted in accordance with the indenture as a result of cash dividend payments and the effects of previous mergers as of december 31 2020 the 2022 convertible notes do not meet the criteria for conversion we have the option to settle the 2022 convertible notes in cash common stock or a combination thereof 

terms of conversion 

on july 1 2019 we settled substantially all of the outstanding balance of the 2019 convertible notes with the issuance of 12553864 shares of our common stock at the settlement date the conversion rate applicable to the 2019 convertible notes was 545954 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount actual  of the 2019 convertible notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1832 per common share — actual  for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 interest expense for the 2019 convertible notes including noncash amortization of discounts was 56 million and 111 million respectively

certain hedging arrangements 

from time to time we enter into derivative instruments to manage the economic risk of changes in interest rates we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and that we have elected to designate as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or that we did not elect to designate as hedges 

designated hedges 

we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variablerate interest payments currently each of our swap agreements is indexed to libor and is designated for hedge accounting purposes libor is set to expire at the end of 2021 and we will work with the counterparties to our swap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 

the table below summarizes our interest rate swap instruments as of december 31 2020  in thousands 



during the year ended december 31 2020 we terminated an interest rate swap and paid the counterparty 152 million in connection with this termination during the year ended december 31 2019 we modified the start date of an interest rate swap and paid the counterparty 82 million in connection with the modification 

during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variablerate interest payments amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variablerate debt during the next 12 months we estimate that 1470 million will be reclassified to earnings as an increase in interest expense 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we accelerated the reclassification of certain amounts in other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of a portion of the hedged forecasted transactions becoming probable not to occur the accelerated amounts represented a loss of 31 million and were recorded as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 we did not accelerate the reclassification of any amounts in other comprehensive income to earnings during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

nondesignated hedges 

concurrent with entering into certain of the mortgage loan agreements and in connection with previous mergers we entered into or acquired and maintain interest rate cap agreements with terms and notional amounts equivalent to the terms and amounts of the mortgage loans made by the third party lenders currently each of our cap agreements is indexed to libor which is set to expire at the end of 2021 we will work with the counterparties to our cap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate to the extent that the maturity date of one or more of the mortgage loans is extended through an exercise of one or more extension options replacement or extension interest rate cap agreements must be executed with terms similar to those associated with the initial interest rate cap agreements and strike prices equal to the greater of the interest rate cap strike price and the interest rate at which the debt service coverage ratio as defined is not less than 12 to 10 the interest rate cap agreements including all of our rights to payments owed by the counterparties and all other rights have been pledged as additional collateral for the mortgage loans additionally in certain instances in order to minimize the cash impact of purchasing required interest rate caps we simultaneously sell interest rate caps which have identical terms and notional amounts such that the purchase price and sales proceeds of the related interest rate caps are intended to offset each other the purchased and sold interest rate caps have strike prices ranging from approximately 375 to 632 

purchase of outstanding debt securities or loans 

as market conditions warrant we our equity investors our and their respective affiliates and members of our management may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt including borrowings under our credit facility and mortgage loans or debt securities that we may issue in the future in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt including borrowings under our credit facility and mortgage loans the amounts involved in any such purchase transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series in addition any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” as defined for united states federal income tax purposes may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us which amounts may be material and in related adverse tax consequences to us 

cash flows 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



operating activities 

our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our homes the rental rates achieved on our leases the collection of rent from our residents and the amount of our operating and other expenses net cash provided by operating activities was 6967 million and 6621 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively an increase of 52 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by improved operational profitability which was partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities 

net cash provided by used in investing activities consists primarily of the acquisition costs of homes capital improvements and proceeds from property sales net cash provided by used in investing activities was 4252 million and 1022 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a decrease of 5274 million the decrease in net cash provided by used in investing activities primarily resulted from the combined effect of the following changes in cash flows during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 1 a decrease in proceeds from the sale of homes 2 an increase in cash used for the initial renovation of homes 3 an increase in cash used for the acquisition of homes 4 an increase in cash used for investments in joint ventures partially offset by 5 an increase in cash provided by repayment proceeds from retained debt securities more specifically proceeds from sales of homes decreased 4407 million from the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2020 due to a significant decrease in the number of homes sold from 3455 to 1580 respectively partially offset by an increase in proceeds per home initial renovation spend increased 413 million from the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due to a significant increase in the number of homes undergoing their initial renovation and an increase in the cost per home acquisition spend increased 356 million due to an increase in the number of homes acquired from 2153 homes during the year ended december 31 2019 to 2252 homes during the year ended december 31 2020 investments in joint ventures spend increased 163 million due to entering into a joint venture with rockpoint during the year ended december 31 2020 proceeds from repayment of retained debt securities increased 221 million from the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2020 due to an increase in prepayments of mortgage loans including the full repayment of swh 20171 during the year ended december 31 2020

we have a commitment which is not reflected in the table above to make additional capital contributions to a joint venture as of december 31 2020 we are committed to fund an additional 594 million to the joint venture 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recentlyissued and adopted accounting standards see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

investments in singlefamily residential properties 

the following significant accounting policies affect the acquisition disposition recognition classification and fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis related to our portfolio of over 80000 singlefamily residential properties in 16 markets across the united states  for a complete discussion of our accounting policy and other factors related to each category below see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

• acquisition of real estate assets our purchases of homes are generally treated as asset acquisitions unless acquired in connection with a business combination for asset acquisitions homes are recorded at their purchase price which is allocated between land building and improvements and inplace lease intangibles when a resident is in place at the acquisition date based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition the purchase price for purposes 

of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees bidding service and title fees payments made to cure tax utility hoa and other mechanic’s and miscellaneous liens as well as other closing costs if the percentage allocated to buildings and improvements versus land for the homes acquired during the year ended december 31 2020 was increased or decreased by 500 bps our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 11 million 

• cost capitalization we incur costs to acquire stabilize and prepare our singlefamily residential properties to be leased we capitalize these costs as a component of our investment in each singlefamily residential property using specific identification and relative allocation methodologies the capitalization period associated with our stabilization activities begins at the time that such activities commence and concludes at the time that a singlefamily residential property is available to be leased 

once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions 

the capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis the weighted average useful lives range from 7 years to 285 years if the useful lives for costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2020 were increased or decreased by 10 our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 50 million 

• provisions for impairment we continuously evaluate by property whether there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our singlefamily residential properties may not be recoverable to the extent an event or change in circumstance is identified a residential property is considered to be impaired only if its carrying value cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property to the extent an impairment has occurred the carrying amount of our investment in a property is adjusted to its estimated fair value the process whereby we assess our singlefamily residential properties for impairment requires significant judgment and assessment of factors that are at times subject to significant uncertainty we evaluate multiple information sources and perform a number of internal analyses each of which are important components of our process with no one information source or analysis being necessarily determinative for those homes for which a change in an event or circumstance was identified in the most recent impairment analysis a 5 change in the estimated fair value of those homes may have resulted in an increase in impairment expense of less than 01 million 

• singlefamily residential properties held for sale from time to time we may identify singlefamily residential properties to be sold once we identify a property to be sold pursuant to gaap requirements we cease depreciating the property measure the property at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less estimated costs to sell and present the property separately within other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets if market values less disposal costs for our properties that were classified as held for sale as of december 31 2020 were 10 lower our impairment expense related to those properties would have increased by approximately 12 million if the market values less disposal costs were 10 higher our impairment expense would have been approximately 02 million lower 

segment reporting 

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the codm in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer 

under the provisions of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes noi as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level with a focus on growing accretively in highgrowth locations where we have greater scale and density 

nongaap measures 

ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare 

ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap before the following items interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” recommends as a best practice that reits that report an ebitda performance measure also report ebitda re  we define ebitda re  consistent with the nareit definition as ebitda further adjusted for gain on sale of property net of tax and impairment on depreciated real estate investments 

adjusted ebitda re is defined as ebitda re before the following items sharebased compensation expense merger and transactionrelated expenses severance casualty gains losses net unrealized gains on investments in equity securities and other income and expenses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re is net income or loss ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re may not be comparable to the ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re for each of the periods indicated 





1 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 3511 3075 and 5500 was recorded in property management expense respectively and 13579 15083 and 23999 was recorded in general and administrative expense respectively

net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses repairs and maintenance leasing costs and marketing expense noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization property management expense general and administrative expense impairment and other gain on sale of property net of tax unrealized gains on investments in equity securities and other income and expenses 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio for each of the periods indicated

funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by nareit as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes as well noncontrolling interests from net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in homes however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for the following noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs loan discounts and noncash interest expense from derivatives sharebased compensation expense offering related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance expense unrealized gains on investments in equity securities and casualty gains losses net as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain the functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo no adjustments were made to the core ffo and adjusted ffo per common share — diluted computations for potential shares of common stock related to the convertible senior notes accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo for each of the periods indicated

with respect to the 2022 convertible notes for the year ended december 31 2020 the numerator for ffo per common share — diluted is adjusted for 17181 of interest expense including noncash amortization of discounts and the denominator is adjusted for 15100443 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2022 convertible notes additionally no such adjustments were made to core ffo and affo per common share —diluted for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 15100443 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2022 convertible notes are excluded from the computation of net income or loss and ffo per common share — diluted as they are antidilutive and are excluded from core ffo and affo per common share — diluted 

6 incremental shares attributed to nonvested sharebased awards totaling 1465286 and 1263825 shares for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for the year ended december 31 2018 we had a net loss and inclusion of incremental shares attributed to nonvested sharebased awards would be antidilutive to net loss per common share — diluted for the computations of ffo core ffo and affo per common share — diluted common share equivalents of 1851297 1748787 and 1150384 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively related to incremental shares attributed to nonvested sharebased awards are included in the denominator 

7 vested units of partnership interests in invh lp “op units” have been excluded from the computation of net income loss per common share — diluted for the periods above because all net income loss attributable to the vested op units has been recorded as noncontrolling interest and thus excluded from net income loss available to common stockholders weighted average vested op units of 3463285 5940757 and 9116476 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively are included in the denominator for the computations of ffo core ffo and affo per common share — diluted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that we may borrow under the credit facility in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2020 our outstanding variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 38373 million and term loan facility of 25000 million for a combined total of 63373 million we effectively converted 910 of these borrowings to a fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements additionally all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt the projected effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in libor on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase of 57 million or 158 million respectively this estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements interest rate cap agreements and any libor floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings a 100 bps decrease in libor results in a negative libor rate and additional interest expense for us our variable rate loan agreements contain libor floors and there is no reciprocal feature in our interest rate swap agreements 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeast united states through disciplined market and asset selection as well as through the mergers we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes 

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior net operating income “noi” growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental market within our 16 markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately 1870 square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are wellpositioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows

advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise have driven the quality of our existing portfolio of 79505 homes as of december 31 2019  we believe that employing experienced inhouse acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize riskadjusted total return

marketing and leasing 

our inhouse personnel are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received andor showings a property has experienced since becoming available and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including our proprietary website internet listing services such as zillow trulia hotpads and realtorcom mls yard signs search engine marketing social and other digital media and local brokers we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and primarily utilize inmarket leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes in some markets we also utilize a network of local real estate agents to show homes to prospective residents and offer those agents limited cobroker fees

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance personnel in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing heating ventilation and air conditioning “hvac” systems plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners we strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our inhouse maintenance technicians in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance personnel provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse maintenance personnel conduct periodic visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventative maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations 

procare service our property management service platform utilizes a number of policies and programs designed to improve the efficiency of our property maintenance practices and maximize resident satisfaction with our service model when a new resident moves into one of our homes our inhouse personnel conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post movein maintenance visit following the movein orientation each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items noted after moving into the home at the time of the post movein maintenance visit approximately 45 days after movein our inhouse property maintenance personnel will address any nonemergency service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance personnel finally the post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance personnel in each of our markets also conduct midlease preventive maintenance visits during preventive maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance personnel inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and carbon monoxide detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct pre moveout visits 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these visits allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these visits allow our inhouse property maintenance personnel to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these visits also increase our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance personnel to assess and document interior and exterior condition whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed if a deficiency is identified by our inhouse property maintenance personnel we endeavor to take prompt action to correct it 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select and on an ongoing basis evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 16 markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base that will experience robust longterm demand and that will benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze numerous factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools and transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria to date we have underwritten more than one million individual homes which gives us a substantial proprietary database on which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets the number of homes underwritten represents the total number of acquisition opportunities that we have considered and of which we have conducted preliminary analysis including acquisition opportunities that were ultimately not pursued or completed as a result of our selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local market real estate brokers and others and leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated personnel located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals evaluate the structural needs and major systems of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of our homes’ fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental occupancy or turnover rates 

through local oversight by inhouse personnel of the entire process of renovating our homes we are able to drive cost efficiencies each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing both time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages approximately 5000 homes per market as of december 31 2019  allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale

risk management 

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties we believe that the systems and processes developed by our board of directors and our experienced executive team allow us to monitor manage and ultimately mitigate these risks for example we seek to maximize revenue collections through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing automated clearing house which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the collection of a majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month 

insurance 

we maintain property casualty and corporatelevel insurance coverage related to our business including general liability business auto umbrella commercial crime directors’ and officers’ liability fiduciary liability cyber liability employment practices liability and workers’ compensation insurance we believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and industry practice however our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions and we are selfinsured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our business and industry — we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance ”

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and leasing our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other real estate investment trusts “reits” that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs and landscaping expenses during the summer season

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 



 • the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

 any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly 

we have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

 in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of approximately 80000 homes as of december 31 2019  our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 

 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as property taxes hoa fees insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

we recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we recorded consolidated net losses for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may record net losses in future periods 

we are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel 

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics and changes in employment legislation if we are 

unable to retain qualified personnel or our labor costs increase significantly our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully 

attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our singlefamily properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

 we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which 

could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including affordability covenants permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions renovations or dispositions result in significant costs delays or losses and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations additionally state and local agencies may place affordability covenants on certain properties to ensure that they are used to provide affordable housing for persons or families of lower income if any of our properties contain affordability covenants recorded in their chains of title  we will be forced to sell such properties at a maximum price limit as calculated per the applicable affordable housing covenant which will likely result in us having to sell such properties below their market values we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions renovations or dispositions or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs or losses our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability  

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

in 2019 the state of california passed the tenant protection act of 2019 a rent control law which limits our ability to increase rental rates for existing residents and put into place protections for the terminations of tenancies we believe this law will negatively affect our rental income from certain of the 12461 homes we own in california as of december 31 2019  

we may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosurerelated issues and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership some of these organizations may shift their litigation lobbying fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlordresident issues while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our business is subject to laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters such as privacy data protection personal information rights of publicity content marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection and online payment services these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently additionally as we depend on third parties for key services see “our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform” we rely on such third party service providers’ compliance with laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection consumer protection and other matters relating to our customers 

there are a number of legislative proposals at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business for example the california consumer privacy act and nevada privacy law effective in 2020 create new data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we also make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly 

since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as hvac roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

we have entered into a threeyear contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale accordingly the inability or unwillingness of this vendor to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer 

we rely on the systems of our third party service providers their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform our work a failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers may reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer in the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets as a result we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in “as is” condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home the holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property or others who are illegally in possession securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and timeconsuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation 

allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk since we may not have obtained title insurance policies 

for properties we acquired through the auction process such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance if an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly may not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and title insurance protection may not be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in this manner we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than singlefamily home acquisitions and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully the costs involved in locating and performing due diligence when feasible on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable in addition a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio 

moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such 

inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and lease such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid property tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities which we may be obligated to pay but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and the lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this option will necessarily be available or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may lease their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs from lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from leasing such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties several states have enacted laws that provide that a 

lien for unpaid monies owed to an hoa may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties such actions if not cured may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on us 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we are subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

vacant properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another we may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longer than assumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs and opportunity costs from lost revenues vacant homes may also be at risk for fraudulent activity which could impact our ability to lease a home as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues incur additional operating expenses and capital expenditures and our homes could be substantially impaired all of which may have a material adverse effect on us 

we rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening vendor partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity we make leasing decisions based on information in rental applications completed by a prospective resident and screened by our third party partner and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate additionally these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness 

declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home alternatively to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year we may lose the opportunity to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires 

many factors impact the singlefamily rental market and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations our income and distributable cash could decline 

the success of our business model depends in part on conditions in the singlefamily rental market in which we operate our investment strategy is based on assumptions about occupancy levels rental rates interest rates and other factors and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate our cash flows and profitability may be reduced recent strengthening of the united states economy and job growth coupled with government programs designed to keep homeowners in their homes andor other factors may contribute to an increase in homeownership rather than renting in addition we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets and convert them to productive uses the supply of singlefamily rental properties will decrease which may increase competition for residents limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties a softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability 

we may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

renters impose additional risks to owning real property renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property accordingly renters may damage a property and its contents and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all a rental property may need repairs andor improvements after each resident vacates the premises the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased accordingly the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes including marketing leasing vendor communications finance intercompany communications our resident portals and property management service platforms which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure are subject and may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions due to the nature of some of the attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and implemented processes procedures and internal controls that are designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber incidents or security breaches any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings misstated or unreliable 

financial data liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity these joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed in addition we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control such actions could among other things impact our ability to maintain our status as a reit further investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our third party partners or coventurers 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in a range of legal and regulatory proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal and regulatory proceedings may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims these actions can be timeconsuming and expensive and may adversely affect our reputation for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind hail pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity fires or wind andor flood risk while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur casualty losses that are not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or 

renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position in the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes wind or floods may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss of income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area 

when we have geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe such as an earthquake especially in california or destructive weather event such as a hurricane affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next we have in the past and may in the future incur losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather for example uninsured losses and damages related to hurricanes irma and harvey totaled 80 million and 215 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

climate change may adversely affect our business 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather andor changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations 

eminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back stock 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the internal 

revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions 

we are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors with respect to the social and environmental impact of our business which may adversely impact our business and ability to raise capital from such investors 

in recent years certain investors have placed increasing importance on the implications of our business with respect to environmental social and governance “esg” matters investors’ increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may constrain our business operations in addition investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the esg factors 

we may have failed to uncover all liabilities of legacy swh business through the due diligence process prior to the mergers exposing us to potentially large unanticipated costs 

prior to completing the mergers we performed certain due diligence reviews of the legacy swh business in view of timing and other considerations relevant to successfully achieving the closing of the mergers our due diligence reviews were necessarily limited in nature and may not adequately have uncovered all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the mergers any such liabilities could cause us to experience potentially significant losses which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms and 7 the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures if the income from a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 85149 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

our access to additional third party sources of financing will depend in part on 

 potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing consequently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms if at all 

secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder andor the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt andor otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default a default under one of our debt agreements could result in a crossdefault under other debt agreements and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable terminate their commitments require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral in accordance with our facility agreements is not available 

for example our mortgage loans and secured term loan see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties 

securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash in such cash management account as the lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans 

these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt fina ncings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification in order to generate cash for funding new investments mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings for example accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities and possible changes in accounting rules interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets as well as the debt markets and the economy generally have caused significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgagebacked securities as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets including a significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 convertible notes or to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes upon a fundamental change our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2022 convertible notes 

holders of the 2022 convertible notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” have the right to require us to repurchase their 2022 convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change such as certain change in control transactions or recapitalization transactions as defined in the indentures governing the 2022 convertible notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes unless we elect to deliver solely common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 convertible notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 convertible notes surrendered therefor or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes in addition our ability to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by future agreements governing our indebtedness the failure to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the 2022 convertible notes indenture or to pay any cash due and payable on the 2022 convertible notes as required by the 2022 convertible notes indentures would constitute a default under the indenture a default under the 2022 convertible notes indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be 

accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2022 convertible notes or make cash payments thereon 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes is triggered holders will be entitled to convert the 2022 convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their 2022 convertible notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

under gaap an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion such as the 2022 convertible notes in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is recorded as a fair value adjustment to the debt component of the 2022 convertible notes the adjustment is treated like a discount for accounting purposes and is amortized into interest expense over the term of the 2022 convertible notes using an effective interest method as a result we will initially be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense because of the amortization of fair value adjustment to the 2022 convertible notes’ face amount over the term of the 2022 convertible notes accordingly we will report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period’s amortization of the fair value adjustment and the 2022 convertible notes’ coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2022 convertible notes 

under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the 2022 convertible notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the “ifconverted” method the effect of which is that the shares of common stock contingently issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent that the conversion value of convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount under the “ifconverted” method for diluted earnings per share purposes convertible debt instruments are accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in stock are issued if such calculation is dilutive to earnings per share for the relevant periods this could adversely affect our reported financial results including our diluted earnings per share 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments totaling 67709 million as of december 31 2019 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” for more information each 100 bps change in interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness would result in a 25 million change in annual interest expense 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items — complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities” 

expected phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the capital markets and our ability to raise capital when libor is discontinued our variable rate debt agreements and financial instruments may be calculated using another base rate 

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding 67709 million of variable rate debt for which maturities extend past 2021 assuming all extensions are exercised that references the london interbank offered rate “libor” as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount if libor is discontinued after 2021 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the agreement and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models this could result in different financial performance for previously recorded transactions and may impact our existing transaction data operations and pricing processes the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest expense libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborbased securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us and on our overall financial condition or results of operations additionally  debt holders or governing bodies may decide to transition to a successor rate prior to the expected libor phaseout date 

risks related to our organization and structure 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 particularly section 404 and the applicable sec rules and regulations that require an annual report of our management on our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner 

if we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control 

certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their shares of common stock including 

 we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl and any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl in addition pursuant to a provision in our bylaws we opted out of the control share provisions of the mgcl provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the mgcl or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in each case without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

in addition the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thencurrent market price our charter provides that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we may not elect to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8 including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director 

our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock including preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 

our charter permits our board of directors without any action by our stockholders to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences conversion and other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock which rights may be superior to those of our common stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of stock over the then current market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indenture governing the 2022 convertible notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

certain provisions in the 2022 convertible notes and the related indenture could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change holders of the 2022 convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2022 convertible notes in cash in addition if a takeover constitutes a makewhole fundamental change we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2022 convertible notes in connection with such takeover in either case and in other cases our obligations under the 2022 convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management 

our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval 

our investment financing borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities including growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by our board of directors these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders our charter also provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit in addition our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements a change in these policies or the termination of our reit election could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law under current maryland law and our charter our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities in addition we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our 

directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests 

our charter contains a provision that expressly permits our nonemployee directors certain of our preipo owners and their affiliates to compete with us 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates other than to those directors who are employed by us or our subsidiaries unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director and none of our preipo owners or any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law each of our nonemployee directors and any of their affiliates may 

 our charter also provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law in the event that any of our nonemployee directors or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and may take any such opportunity for itself himself or herself or offer it to another person or entity unless the business opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as our director these provisions may limit our ability to pursue business or investment opportunities that we might otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items 

if we do not maintain our qualification as a reit we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability 

we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the code we could fail to meet various compliance requirements which could jeopardize our reit status furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year then 

 reits in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may become subject to united states federal income taxes and related state and local taxes for example net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a reit a “prohibited transaction” under the code will be subject to a 100 tax we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits similarly if we were to fail an income test and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file united states federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property including income franchise payroll mortgage recording and transfer taxes either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets such as our trss which are subject to full united states federal state local and foreign corporatelevel income taxes any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

in order to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences in addition to the quarterly asset test requirements we must annually satisfy two income test requirements the “75 and 95 gross income tests” as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders we may be unable to pursue investments that would otherwise be advantageous to it in order to satisfy the income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a “borrowings hedge” or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income each such hedge a “currency hedge” if clearly identified under applicable united states treasury “treasury” regulations does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit this exclusion from the 95 and 75 gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a borrowings hedge or a currency hedge a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses from hedges held in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs provided however losses in our trs arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 may only be carried forward and may only be deducted against 80 of future taxable income in the trs 

complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 

from time to time our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the code thus we could be required to borrow funds sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative these options could increase our costs or reduce our equity 

even if we qualify to be subject to united states federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo reorganization transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to united states 

federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the builtin gain tax however there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares of stock whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future and any decision to grant a waiver from the ownership limit in any particular instance is at the sole discretion of our board of directors any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends 

in connection with our qualification as a reit we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain in order to satisfy this requirement we may make distributions that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock which could account for up to 90 of the aggregate amount of such distributions at the election of each stockholder taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes as a result united states stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received accordingly united states holders receiving a distribution of our stock may be required to sell stocks received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a united states stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to certain nonunited states holders we may be required to withhold united states tax with respect to such 

distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service “irs” will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cashstock distributions including on a retroactive basis or assert that the requirements for such taxable cashstock distributions have not been met 

dividends payable by reits do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable by nonreit “c” corporations to certain noncorporate united states stockholders is currently 238 taking into account the 38 medicare tax applicable to net investment income dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 those noncorporate united states stockholders may deduct 20 of their dividends from reits excluding qualified dividend income and capital gains dividends for those united states stockholders in the top marginal tax bracket of 37 the deduction for reit dividends yields an effective income tax rate of 296 on reit dividends which is higher than the 238 tax rate on qualified dividend income paid by nonreit “c” corporations although the legislation benefits the taxation of reits and dividends payable by reits the more favorable rates applicable to nonreit corporate qualified dividends could cause certain noncorporate investors to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including our common stock 

we are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth 

as with other reits but unlike corporations generally our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90 of our reit taxable income in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of united states federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock for example the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” has resulted in fundamental changes to the code among the numerous changes included in the tcja is a deduction of 20 of ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 through 2025 we cannot assure you that the tcja or any such changes in the future will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of the tcja on your investment in our stock and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 

to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory 

our ownership of and relationship with any trs will be restricted and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our reit status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax 

a reit may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more trss a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than 20 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss the value of our interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a trs may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 as amended a trs will pay united states federal state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis 

any trs we own as a domestic corporation will pay united states federal state and local income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us the aggregate value of the trs stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets including the trs stock and securities although we plan to monitor our investments in trss there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20 limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above 

recharacterization of leases as financing transactions may negatively affect us 

while we generally intend to use reasonable commercial efforts to structure any lease transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” with us treated as the owner and lessor of the property for federal income tax purposes the irs could challenge such characterization in the event that any lease transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a sellerfinanced conditional sale transaction for federal income tax purposes deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed in addition if we enter such transactions at the reit level in the event of recharacterization the reit could be subject to prohibited transaction taxes finally the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year and require us to pay deficiency dividends interest and penalty taxes in order to maintain reit status 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

we have elected to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets or reduce such distributions if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our 

common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for united states federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their stock a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s stock they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by market conditions and by our actual and expected future earnings and level of cash dividends 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of stock without regard to our operating performance for example the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates one of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments as a result if interest rates rise it is possible that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interestbearing securities increase in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our stock could decrease significantly the market value of the equity securities of a reit is also based upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales or refinancings and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of stock to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock

the following table provides summary information regarding our total and same store portfolios as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 as noted below 







factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control see part i item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals rental rates and occupancy levels turnover rates and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance property acquisitions and renovations and financing arrangements 

market fundamentals our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 705 of our rental revenues and other property income during the year ended december 31 2019  in recent periods our western united states and florida markets have experienced favorable demand fundamentals with employment growth strong household formation rates and favorable supply fundamentals such as the rate of new supply delivery we believe these supply and demand fundamentals have driven favorable rental rate growth and home price appreciation for our western united states and florida markets in recent periods and we expect these trends to continue in the near to intermediate term 

rental rates and occupancy levels rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years 

turnover rates and days to reresident other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents resident turnover rates and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory economic conditions and economic outlook increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period 

property improvements and maintenance property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

property acquisitions and renovations future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental the scope of renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property and whether the property was vacant when acquired due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense mortgage loans secured term loan term loan facility revolving facility and convertible debt as well as our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and certain financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms interest rates are impacted by market conditions and the terms of the underlying financing arrangements see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we owned 79505 and 80807 singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio  during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we acquired 2153 and 938 homes respectively and sold 3455 and 2701 homes respectively during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we owned an average of 80372 and 82171 singlefamily rental homes respectively 

we believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business to do so we provide information regarding the performance of our same store portfolio 

as of december 31 2019  our same store portfolio consisted of 70799 singlefamily rental homes 

rental revenues and other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled 17647 million and 17230 million  respectively an increase of 24  driven by an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and an increase in utilities reimbursements partially offset by a slight decrease in average occupancy and a 1799 home decrease between periods in the average number of homes owned 

average occupancy for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 for the total portfolio was 942 and 946  respectively average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1809 and 1735  respectively a 43 increase for our same store portfolio average occupancy was 963 and 958 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and average monthly rent per occupied home for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1812 and 1741  respectively a 41 increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized nonservice concessions to calculate net effective rental rate growth leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for 

a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home 

renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 50 and 48 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 38 and 33 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively for our same store portfolio renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 50 and 48 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 38 and 34 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the annual turnover rate for the same store portfolio for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 301 and 325  respectively for the same store portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 46 days between residents for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

the increase in other property income during the year ended december 31 2019 was driven by utilities reimbursements which increased as more utilities remained in our name compared to prior year additionally the terms of new leases require residents to reimburse us for those costs this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of homes owned during 2019 

expenses 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  total expenses were 17255 million and 17846 million  respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased to 6700 million for the year ended december 31 2019 from 6554 million for the year ended december 31 2018  driven by increases related to utilities property taxes hoa assessments and fines and insurance premiums partially offset by decreases in certain controllable expenses created by continued process improvements lower turnover propertylevel synergies from the mergers  and a decrease in average home count 

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased to 1359 million for the year ended december 31 2019 from 1642 million for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to decreases in sharebased compensation expense of 113 million and a decrease in merger and transactionrelated expenses of 125 million  

interest expense was 3672 million and 3836 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average debt balance outstanding due to prepayments made on the mortgage loans and redemption of convertible debt for common equity during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts decreased to 84675 million as of december 31 2019 from 92498 million as of december 31 2018  additionally the weighted average spread inclusive of servicing fees over libor decreased as a result of refinancing activity and prepayments made on the mortgage loan during the year ended december 31 2019  these items were partially offset by an increase in the average one month libor rate of 20 bps from 202 during the year ended december 31 2018 to 222 during the year ended december 31 2019  

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 5337 million for the year ended december 31 2019 from 5605 million for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to 375 million of amortization of inplace leases from the mergers that were fully amortized during the year ended december 31 2018  additionally the average number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2019 decreased as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation due to additional capital expenditures 

impairment and other expenses were 187 million and 208 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively during the year ended december 31 2019  impairment and other expenses was comprised of impairment losses of 142 million on our singlefamily residential properties and casualty losses of 45 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  impairment and other expenses was comprised of impairment losses of 67 million on our singlefamily residential properties and casualty losses of 141 million  including losses and damages related to hurricanes irma and harvey of 80 million  

other net 

other net increased to 116 million for the year ended december 31 2019 from 70 million for the year ended december 31 2018  due to changes in the components of our miscellaneous income and expenses and 65 million in u nrealized gains on investment in equity securities  

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property net of tax was 963 million and 497 million f or the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively  the increased gain on sale was driven by an increase in the number of homes sold and an increase in the average gain per home during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the number of homes sold was 3455 and 2701  respectively 

year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 

for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our year ended december 31 2018 results compared to our year ended december 31 2017 results refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 2018 10k  

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2019 and 2018 includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 923 million and 1449 million  respectively a 363 decrease  we use excess cash flows for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness and strive to minimize the level of cash held for working capital requirements additionally our 10000 million revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” remains undrawn as of december 31 2019  

on august 22 2019 we entered into distribution agreements with a syndicate of banks the “agents” pursuant to which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate sales price of 8000 million of our common stock through the agents the “atm equity program” the atm equity program was established in order to use the net proceeds from sales under the program for general corporate purposes which may include without limitation working capital repayment of indebtedness acquisitions and renovations of singlefamily properties  and for related activities in accordance with our business strategy during the year ended december 31 2019  we sold 1957139 shares of our common stock under our atm equity program generating net proceeds of 553 million after giving effect to agent commissions and other costs totaling 17 million  as of december 31 2019  7430 million remains available for future offerings under the atm equity program 

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make dividend payments to our stockholders and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i renovating newlyacquired homes ii funding hoa fees as applicable property taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance of our homes iii interest expense and iv payment of dividends to our equity investors our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal payments on our indebtedness 

we intend to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions we believe our rental income net of total expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a nearterm basis our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives such as the revolving facility which had an undrawn balance of 10000 million as of december 31 2019  

as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

certain securitizations the secured term loan the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility all defined below and collectively the “liborbased loans” use libor as a benchmark for establishing interest rates our derivative instruments are also indexed to libor the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom the governing body responsible for regulating libor announced that it will no longer compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make libor submissions after 2021 once libor is phased out the interest rates for our liborbased loans will be based on a comparable or successor rate as provided for in our loan agreements  we will work with the counterparties to our swap and cap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate while we do not expect that the transition from libor and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs the ultimate outcome of this change is uncertain at this time and significant management time and attention may be required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and to implement necessary changes to our financial models 

the following describes the key terms of our current indebtedness 

mortgage loans 

our securitization transactions the “securitizations” or the “mortgage loans” are collateralized by certain homes owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of invh lp that were formed to facilitate certain of our financing arrangements the “borrower entities” we utilize the proceeds from our securitizations to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness ii initial deposits into securitization reserve accounts iii closing costs in connection with the mortgage loans and iv general costs associated with our operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our mortgage loan indebtedness as of december 31 2019 and 2018  







approved counterparty within the required timeframe to the lender  our swh 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans have exercised the first extension option the maturity dates above reflect all extensions that have been exercised 

 securitization transactions 

for each securitization transaction the borrower entity executed a loan agreement with a third party lender except for ih 20171 each outstanding mortgage loan originally consisted of six floating rate components the two year initial terms are individually subject to three to five  one year extension options at the borrower entity’s discretion such extensions are available provided there is no continuing event of default under the respective mortgage loan agreement and the borrower entity obtains and delivers a replacement interest rate cap agreement from an approved counterparty within the required timeframe to the lender ih 20171 is a 10 year fixed rate mortgage loan comprised of two components certificates issued by the trust in connection with component a of ih 20171 benefit from the federal national mortgage association’s guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest 

each mortgage loan is secured by a pledge of the equity in the assets of the respective borrower entities as well as firstpriority mortgages on the underlying properties and a grant of security interests in all of the related personal property as of december 31 2019 and 2018  a total of 37040 and 41644 homes respectively with a net book value of 71376 million and 83854 million  respectively are pledged pursuant to the mortgage loans each borrower entity has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the respective loan agreements to substitute properties we are obligated to make monthly payments of interest for each mortgage loan 

transactions with trusts 

concurrent with the execution of each mortgage loan agreement the respective third party lender sold each loan it originated to individual depositor entities the “depositor entities” who subsequently transferred each loan to securitizationspecific trust entities the “trusts” the depositor entities for our currently outstanding securitizations are wholly owned subsidiaries 

as consideration for the transfer of each loan to the trusts the trusts issued classes of certificates which mirror the components of the individual loans collectively the “certificates” to the depositor entities except that class r certificates do not have related loan components as they represent residual interests in the trusts the certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trusts following receipt of the certificates the depositor entities sold the certificates to investors and used the proceeds as consideration for the loans sold to the depositor entities by the lenders these transactions had no effect on our consolidated financial statements other than with respect to certificates we retained in connection with securitizations or purchased at a later date 

the trusts are structured as passthrough entities that receive interest payments from the securitizations and distribute those payments to the holders of the certificates the assets held by the trusts are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of those entities the obligations of the trusts do not have any recourse to the general credit of any entities in these consolidated financial statements we have evaluated our interests in certain certificates of the trusts held by us discussed below and determined that they do not create a more than insignificant variable interest in the trusts additionally the retained certificates do not provide us with any ability to direct the activities that could impact the trusts’ economic performance therefore we do not consolidate the trusts 

retained certificates 

as the trusts made certificates available for sale to both domestic and foreign investors sponsors of the mortgage loans are required to retain a portion of the risk that represents a material net economic interest in each loan pursuant to regulation rr the “risk retention rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as such loan sponsors are required to retain a portion of the credit risk that represents not less than 5 of the aggregate fair value of the loan as of the closing date 

to fulfill these requirements class g certificates for csh 20162 were issued in an amount equal to 5 of the original principal amount of the loans per the terms of the csh 20162 mortgage loan agreement the class g certificates were restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to the sponsor we retained these class g certificates during the time the related securitization was outstanding and they were principal only bearing a stated interest rate of 00005  

for ih 20171 the class b certificates are restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to invh lp in order to comply with the risk retention rules the class b certificates bear a stated annual interest rate of 423  including applicable servicing fees 

for swh 20171 ih 20172 ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 we retain 5 of each class of certificates to meet the risk retention rules these retained certificates accrue interest at a floating rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 076 to 347  

the retained certificates total 3170 million and 3666 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and are classified as held to maturity investments and recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets  

loan covenants 

the general terms that apply to all of the mortgage loans require each borrower entity to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants include each borrower entity’s and certain of their respective affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the mortgage loan agreements ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the respective mortgage loan agreements negative covenants include each borrower entity’s and certain of their affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of each borrower entity’s indebtedness and the nature of their investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager iv the nature of each borrower entity’s business activities and v the required maintenance of specified cash reserves as of december 31 2019  and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe each borrower entity is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants 

prepayments 

for the mortgage loans prepayments of amounts owed by us are generally not permitted under the terms of the respective mortgage loan agreements unless such prepayments are made pursuant to the voluntary election or mandatory provisions specified in such agreements the specified mandatory provisions become effective to the extent that a property becomes characterized as a disqualified property a property is sold andor upon the occurrence of a condemnation or casualty event associated with a property to the extent either a voluntary election is made or a mandatory prepayment condition exists in addition to paying all interest and principal we must also pay certain breakage costs as determined by the loan servicer and a spread maintenance premium if prepayment occurs before the month following the one or two year anniversary of the closing dates of each of the mortgage loans except for ih 20171 for ih 20171 prepayments on or before december 2026 will require a yield maintenance premium for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we made voluntary and mandatory prepayments of 9974 million and 45796 million  respectively under the terms of the mortgage loan agreements during the year ended december 31 2019  prepayments included the full repayment of the csh 20162 mortgage loan during the year ended december 31 2018  prepayments included full repayment of the cah 20141 cah 20142 cah 20151 csh 20161 ih 20151 ih 20152 and ih 20153 mortgage loans 

secured term loan 

on june 7 2019 20191 ih borrower lp a consolidated subsidiary “20191 ih borrower” and one of our borrower entities entered into a 12 year loan agreement with a life insurance company the “secured term loan” the secured term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 359  including applicable servicing fees for the first 11 years and bears interest at a floating rate based on a spread of 147 bps including applicable servicing fees over one month libor subject to certain adjustments as outlined in the loan agreement for the twelfth year the secured term loan is secured by first priority mortgages on a portfolio of singlefamily rental properties as well as a first priority pledge of the equity interests of 20191 ih borrower we utilized the proceeds from the secured term loan to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness ii initial deposits into the secured term loan’s reserve accounts iii transaction costs related to the closing of the secured term loan and iv general corporate purposes 

the following table sets forth a summary of our secured term loan indebtedness as of december 31 2019 and 2018  





 collateral 

as of december 31 2019  a total of 3333 homes with a net book value of 7348 million are included in the secured term loan’s collateral pool 20191 ih borrower has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the loan agreement to substitute properties representing up to 20 of the collateral pool annually and to substitute properties representing up to 100 of the collateral pool over the life of the secured term loan in addition four times after the first anniversary of the closing date 20191 ih borrower has the right subject to certain requirements and limitations outlined in the loan agreement to execute a special release of collateral representing up to 15 of the thenoutstanding principal balance of the secured term loan in order to bring the loantovalue ratio back in line with the secured term loan’s loantovalue ratio as of the closing date any such special release of collateral would not change the thenoutstanding principal balance of the secured term loan but rather would reduce the number of singlefamily rental homes included in the collateral pool 

loan covenants 

the secured term loan requires 20191 ih borrower to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants include 20191 ih borrower’s and certain of its affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the mortgage loan agreements ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the respective mortgage loan agreements negative covenants include 20191 ih borrower’s and certain of its affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of 20191 ih borrower’s indebtedness and the nature of its investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager iv the nature of 20191 ih borrower’s business activities and v the required maintenance of specified cash reserves as of december 31 2019  and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe 20191 ih borrower is in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants 

prepayments 

prepayments of the secured term loan are generally not permitted unless such prepayments are made pursuant to the voluntary election or mandatory provisions specified in the loan agreement the specified mandatory provisions become effective to the extent that a property becomes characterized as a disqualified property a property is sold andor upon the occurrence of a condemnation or casualty event associated with a property to the extent either a voluntary election is made or a mandatory prepayment condition exists in addition to paying all interest and principal we must also pay certain breakage costs as determined by the loan servicer and a yield maintenance premium if prepayment occurs before june 9 2030 as of december 31 2019  no such prepayments have been made 

term loan facility and revolving facility 

on february 6 2017 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks financial institutions and institutional lenders for a credit facility the “credit facility” which was amended on december 18 2017 to include entities and homes acquired in the mergers the credit facility provides 25000 million of borrowing capacity and consists of a 10000 million revolving facility which will mature on february 6 2021 with a one year extension option and a 15000 million term loan facility the “term loan facility” which will mature on february 6 2022 the revolving facility also includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings in each case subject to certain sublimits the credit facility provides us with the option to enter into additional incremental credit facilities including an uncommitted incremental facility that provides us with the option to increase the size of the revolving facility andor the term loan facility by an aggregate amount of up to 15000 million   subject to certain limitations proceeds from the term loan facility were used to repay thenoutstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes proceeds from the revolving facility are used for general corporate purposes 

the following table sets forth a summary of the outstanding principal amounts under the credit facility as of december 31 2019 and 2018  





 interest rate and fees 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a libor rate determined by reference to the bloomberg libor rate or a comparable or successor rate as provided for in our loan agreement for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or b a base rate determined by reference to the highest of 1 the administrative agent’s prime lending rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3 the libor rate that would be payable on such day for a libor rate loan with a one month interest period plus 100  the margin is based on a total leverage based grid the margin for the revolving facility ranges from 075 to 130 in the case of base rate loans and 175 to 230 in the case of libor rate loans the margin for the term loan facility ranges from 070 to 130 in the case of base rate loans and 170 to 230 in the case of libor rate loans in addition the credit facility provides that upon receiving an investment grade rating on its noncredit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt of bbb or better from standard  poor’s rating services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc or baa3 or better from moody’s investors service inc an “investment grade rating event” we may elect to convert to a credit rating based pricing grid 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving facility in respect of the unused commitments thereunder the facility fee rate is based on the daily unused amount of the revolving facility and is either 035 or 020 per annum based on the unused facility amount upon converting to a credit rating pricing based grid the unused facility fee will no longer apply and we will be required to pay a facility fee ranging from 0125 to 0300  we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees 

prepayments and amortization 

no principal reductions are required under the credit facility we are permitted to voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the term loan facility at any time without premium or penalty subject to certain minimum amounts and the payment of customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans once repaid no further borrowings will be permitted under the term loan facility

guarantees and security 

the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of our direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries that own directly or indirectly unencumbered assets the “subsidiary guarantors” subject to certain exceptions the guarantee provided by any subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released upon the occurrence of certain events including if it no longer has a direct or indirect interest in an unencumbered asset or as a result of certain nonrecourse refinancing transactions pursuant to which such subsidiary guarantor becomes contractually prohibited from providing its guaranty of the credit facility in addition invh may be required to provide a guarantee of the credit facility under certain circumstances including if invh does not maintain its qualification as a reit

convertible senior notes 

in connection with the mergers we assumed swh’s convertible senior notes in july 2014 swh issued 2300 million in aggregate principal amount of 300 convertible senior notes due 2019 the “2019 convertible notes” interest on the 2019 convertible notes was payable semiannually in arrears on january 1st and july 1st of each year on december 28 2018 we notified note holders of our intent to settle conversions of the 2019 convertible notes in shares of common stock the notes matured o n july 1 2019  and we settled substantially all of the outstanding balance of the 2019 convertible notes through the issuance of 12553864 shares of our common stock  

in january 2017 swh issued 3450 million in aggregate principal amount of 350 convertible senior notes due 2022 the “2022 convertible notes” and together with the 2019 convertible notes the “convertible senior notes” interest on the 2022 convertible notes is payable semiannually in arrears on january 15th and july 15th of each year the 2022 convertible notes will mature on january 15 2022 

the following table summarizes the terms of the convertible senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 2018  





 terms of conversion 

at the settlement date the conversion rate applicable to the 2019 convertible notes was 545954 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount actual  of the 2019 convertible notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1832 per common share — actual  on july 1 2019  we settled substantially all of the outstanding balance of the 2019 convertible notes with the issuance of 12553864 shares of our common stock for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  interest expense for the 2019 convertible notes including noncash amortization of discounts was 56 million and 111 million  respectively 

as of december 31 2019  the conversion rate applicable to the 2022 convertible notes is 437694 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount actual  of the 2022 convertible notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2285 per common share — actual  the conversion rate for the 2022 convertible notes is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest in addition following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date we will adjust the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 convertible notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances at any time prior to july 15 2021 holders may convert the 2022 convertible notes at their option only under specific circumstances as defined in the indenture agreement dated as of january 10 2017 between us and our trustee wilmington trust national association the “convertible notes trustee” on or after july 15 2021 and until maturity holders may convert all or any portion of the 2022 convertible notes at any time upon conversion we will pay or deliver as the case may be cash common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election the “ifconverted” value of the 2022 convertible notes exceeds their principal amount by 1076 million as of december 31 2019 as the closing market price of our common stock of 2997 per common share actual  exceeds the implicit conversion price for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  interest expense for the 2022 convertible notes including noncash amortization of discounts was 169 million and 167 million  respectively 

general terms 

we may not redeem the 2022 convertible notes prior to their maturity date except to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes as further described in the indenture if we undergo a fundamental change as defined in the indenture holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2022 convertible notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2022 convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date 

the indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default if an event of default occurs and is continuing the convertible notes trustee by notice to us or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 convertible notes by notice to us and the convertible notes trustee may and the convertible notes trustee at the request of such holders shall declare 100 of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the 2022 convertible notes to be due and payable in the case of an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization in respect to us as set forth in the indenture 100 of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the 2022 convertible notes will automatically become due and payable 

certain hedging arrangements 

from time to time we enter into derivative instruments to manage the economic risk of changes in interest rates we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and that we have elected to designate as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or that we did not elect to designate as hedges 

designated hedges 

we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variablerate interest payments currently each of our swap agreements is indexed to libor and is designated for hedge accounting purposes libor is set to expire at the end of 2021 and we will work with the counterparties to our swap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings prior to january 31 2017 all swaps were accounted for as nondesignated hedges as the criteria for designation had not been met at that time 

in addition in connection with the mergers we acquired various interest rate swap instruments which we designated for hedge accounting purposes on the merger date we recorded these interest rate swaps at their aggregate estimated fair value of 211 million  over the terms of each of these swaps an amount equal to the merger date fair value will be amortized and reclassified into earnings 

the table below summarizes our interest rate swap instruments as of december 31 2019  in thousands 





 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variablerate interest payments amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variablerate debt during the next 12 months we estimate that 449 million will be reclassified to earnings as a decrease in interest expense 

nondesignated hedges 

concurrent with entering into certain of the mortgage loan agreements and in connection with the mergers we entered into or acquired and maintain interest rate cap agreements with terms and notional amounts equivalent to the terms and amounts of the mortgage loans made by the third party lenders  currently each of our cap agreements is indexed to libor which is set to expire at the end of 2021 we will work with the counterparties to our cap agreements to adjust each floating rate to a comparable or successor rate to the extent that the maturity date of one or more of the mortgage loans is extended through an exercise of one or more extension options replacement or extension interest rate cap agreements must be executed with terms similar to those associated with the initial interest rate cap agreements and strike prices equal to the greater of the interest rate cap strike price and the interest rate at which the debt service coverage ratio as defined is not less than 12 to 10  the interest rate cap agreements including all of our rights to payments owed by the counterparties and all other rights 

have been pledged as additional collateral for the mortgage loans additionally in certain instances in order to minimize the cash impact of purchasing required interest rate caps we simultaneously sell interest rate caps which have identical terms and notional amounts such that the purchase price and sales proceeds of the related interest rate caps are intended to offset each other the purchased and sold interest rate caps have strike prices ranging from approximately 324 to 531  

purchase of outstanding debt securities or loans 

as market conditions warrant we our equity investors our and their respective affiliates and members of our management may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans or debt securities that we may issue in the future in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans the amounts involved in any such purchase transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series in addition any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” as defined for united states federal income tax purposes may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us which amounts may be material and in related adverse tax consequences to us

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



operating activities

year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 

for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our year ended december 31 2018 results compared to our year ended december 31 2017 results refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 2018 10k  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  consist of the following 







critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting standards see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

investments in singlefamily residential properties 

the following significant accounting policies affect the acquisition disposition recognition classification and fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis related to our portfolio of approximately 80000 singlefamily residential properties in 16 markets across the united states  for a complete discussion of our accounting policy and other factors related to each category below see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions 

the capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis the weighted average useful lives range from 7 years to 285 years if the useful lives for costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2019 were increased or decreased by 10  our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 50 million  



derivatives 

we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements collectively “hedging derivatives” for interest rate risk management purposes we do not enter into hedging derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes and all of our hedging derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and that we have elected to designate as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or that we have not elected to designate as hedges 

we utilize third party specialists who use modeling techniques and assumptions to estimate the fair value of derivative instruments assumptions include forward yield curves and nonperformance risk if interest rates had increased or decreased by 50 bps  the termination value of our net derivative assetliability would have changed by approximately 1500 million  as our interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedges this change would be reflected in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings our interest rates caps would not be materially affected 

segment reporting 

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the codm in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer 

under the provision of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes noi as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level with a focus on growing accretively in highgrowth locations where we have greater scale and density 

nongaap measures 

ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare 

ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap before the following items interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” recommends as a best practice that reits that report an ebitda performance measure also report ebitda re  we define ebitda re  consistent with the nareit definition as ebitda further adjusted for gain on sale of property net of tax and impairment on depreciated real estate investments 

adjusted ebitda re is defined as ebitda re before the following items sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance casualty losses net interest income unrealized gains from an investment in equity securities and other miscellaneous income and expenses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re is net income or loss ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re may not be comparable to the ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re for each of the periods indicated 





 net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses repairs and maintenance leasing costs and marketing expense noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization property management expense general and administrative expense impairment and other gain on sale of property net of tax and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio for each of the periods indicated 







funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by nareit as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes as well noncontrolling interests from net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in homes however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for the following noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs loan discounts and noncash interest expense for derivatives sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses offering related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance expense unrealized gains on investment in equity securities  and casualty losses net as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain the functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo no adjustments were made to the core ffo and adjusted ffo per common share — diluted computations for potential shares of common stock related to the convertible senior notes accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap to ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo for each of the periods indicated 







 

the impact of the 2019 convertible notes in the period prior to conversion is reflected in the ffo per common share — diluted computation above in accordance with the “ifconverted” method consistent with nareit’s guidance for calculating ffo per share for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the numerator for ffo per common share — diluted is adjusted for 5586 and 11057 respectively of interest expense on the 2019 convertible notes including noncash amortization of discounts for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the denominator is adjusted for 6225341 and 12420013 respectively potential shares of common stock for the 2019 convertible notes for the period prior to conversion no such adjustments were made to core ffo and affo per common share — diluted for the 2019 convertible notes for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  15100443 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2022 convertible notes are also excluded from the computation of net income or loss and ffo per common share — diluted as they are antidilutive and are excluded from core ffo and affo per common share — diluted for the period from february 1 2017 through december 31 2017  we asserted our intent and ability to fully settle the convertible senior notes in cash and as a result the convertible senior notes did not impact diluted eps during that period 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that we may borrow under the credit facility in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2019  our outstanding variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 52709 million and term loan facility of 15000 million  for a combined total of 67709 million  we effectively converted 963 of these borrowings to a fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements additionally all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt the projected effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in libor on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase or decrease of 25 million  this estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements interest rate cap agreements and any libor floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeast united states through disciplined market and asset selection as well as through the mergers we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes   

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior net operating income “noi” growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental market  within our 17   markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately 1850  square feet with three  bedrooms and two  bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are wellpositioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows   

our platform

asset management and property management functions our platform enables our teams to incorporate realtime information regarding leasing activity property operations maintenance and capital spending into asset selection we believe the advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise have driven the quality of our existing portfolio of 80807  homes as of december 31 2018  we believe that employing experienced inhouse acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize riskadjusted total return

our inhouse personnel are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received andor showings a property has experienced since becoming available and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including our proprietary website internet listing services such as zillow trulia hotpads and realtorcom mls yard signs social and other digital media and local brokers we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and primarily utilize inmarket leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes in some markets we also utilize a network of local real estate agents to show homes to prospective residents and offer those agents limited cobroker fees 

prospective residents may submit an application through the application portal on our website or in person in order to maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements we utilize standardized online applications national lease agreements movein and moveout documents resident communications and other ancillary documents we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity although we 

require a minimum income to rent ratio many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process including eviction history criminal history and rental and other payment history 

our disciplined investment strategy and local inmarket approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods enabling us to execute demographic and geotargeted digital advertising we believe this increases our likelihood of capturing and retaining qualified residents whose lifestyle and purchasing power enhance our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services 

digital marketing initiatives and branding 

we encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website blog and social media accounts with articles home maintenance advice contests and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes for example we alert our residents to prepare for storms and incentivize them to pay their rent online 

resident relations and property maintenance 

our inhouse personnel in each of our markets are also responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations in coordination with a third party vendor we offer a 247 emergency telephone line to handle after hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed and our residents can also contact us through our online resident portal our call centers or our local property management offices as part of our ongoing property management process we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner as appropriate by appointment at the resident’s convenience we seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize longterm rental income and cash flows from our portfolio 

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance personnel in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing heating ventilation and air conditioning “hvac” systems plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners we strive to maximize the number of maintenance calls that are addressed by our inhouse maintenance technicians in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance personnel provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse property management personnel conduct periodic visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventative maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations 

procare service our property management service platform utilizes a number of policies and programs designed to improve the efficiency of our property maintenance practices and maximize resident satisfaction with our service model when a new resident moves into one of our homes our inhouse personnel conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post movein maintenance visit following the movein orientation each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items noted after moving into the home at the time of the first movein maintenance visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel will address any nonemergency service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance personnel finally the post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance personnel in each of our markets also conduct midlease preventive maintenance visits during preventive maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance personnel inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left 

unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and carbon monoxide detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct pre moveout visits 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these visits allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these visits allow our inhouse property maintenance personnel to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these visits also increase our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance personnel to assess and document interior and exterior condition whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could result in us incurring significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously our markets were generally selected through a robust process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select and on an ongoing basis evaluate our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 17  markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base that will experience robust longterm demand and that will benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze numerous factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools and transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters who provide strategic direction and broad oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria to date we have underwritten more than one million individual homes which gives us a substantial proprietary database on which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets the number of homes underwritten represents the total number of acquisition opportunities that we have considered and of which we have conducted preliminary analysis including acquisition opportunities that were ultimately not pursued or completed as a result of our selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local market real estate brokers and others and leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinates with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical 

acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated personnel located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals evaluate the structural needs and major systems of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of our homes’ fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental occupancy or turnover rates 

through local oversight by inhouse personnel of the entire process of renovating our homes we are able to drive cost efficiencies each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing both time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages approximately 4800  homes per market as of december 31 2018  allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale 

corporate responsibility 

corporate social responsibility is vitally important to who we are as a company we support social and environmental initiatives particularly in our operations and communities we strive to manage and minimize negative impacts throughout the value chain where possible and work on developing sustainable business practices through our organization we believe that we can respond to local and global environmental challenges by combining our strengths in sustainability innovation and partnership our corporate social responsibility policy is posted on our corporate website and applies to all activities undertaken by or on behalf of invitation homes anywhere we operate   this policy encompasses areas of community and associate engagement human rights corporate governance and ethics and environmental initiatives that reflect existing and emerging standards of corporate social responsibility

risk management 

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties we believe that the systems and processes developed by our board of directors and our experienced executive team allow us to monitor manage and ultimately mitigate these risks for example we seek to minimize bad debt expense through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing automated clearing house which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the collection of a majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month 

insurance 

we maintain property casualty and corporatelevel insurance coverage related to our business including general liability business auto umbrella commercial crime directors’ and officers’ liability fiduciary liability cyber liability employment practices liability and workers’ compensation insurance we believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and industry practice however our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions and we are selfinsured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions see part i item 1a “risk factors — risks related to our business and industry — we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance”

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and leasing our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be leased or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other real estate investment trusts “reits” that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs and landscaping expenses during the summer season

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 

 • the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

• changes in laws including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates 

 any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly 

we have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

 in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of over 80000 homes as of december 31 2018 our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 



 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as property taxes hoa fees insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

we have recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we have recorded consolidated net losses for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may likely continue to record net losses in future periods 

we are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel 

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or our labor costs increase significantly our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our singlefamily properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

 we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions or renovations result in significant costs or delays and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements additionally such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability 

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

we may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosurerelated issues and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership some of these organizations may shift their litigation lobbying fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlordresident issues while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we also make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as hvac roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

we have entered into a threeyear contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale accordingly the inability or unwillingness of this vendor to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer 

we rely on the systems of our third party service providers their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform our work a failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers may reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer in the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets as a result we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in “as is” condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home the holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and timeconsuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation 

allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk since we may not have obtained title insurance policies for properties we acquired through the auction process such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance if an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection 

with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly may not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and title insurance protection may not be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in this manner we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than singlefamily home acquisitions and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully the costs involved in locating and performing due diligence when feasible on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable in addition a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio 

moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and lease such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid property tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors 

or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities which we may be obligated to pay but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and the lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this option will necessarily be available or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may lease their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs from lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from leasing such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties several states have enacted laws that provide that a lien for unpaid monies owed to an hoa may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties such actions if not cured may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on us 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws 

may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we may be subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

vacant properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another we may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longer than assumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs and opportunity costs from lost revenues in addition the value of a vacant property could be substantially impaired as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues which may have a material adverse effect on us 

we rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening vendor partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity we make leasing decisions based on information in rental applications completed by a prospective resident and screened by our third party partner and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate additionally these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home alternatively to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year we may lose the opportunity to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires 

many factors impact the singlefamily rental market and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations our income and distributable cash could decline 

the success of our business model depends in part on conditions in the singlefamily rental market in which we operate our investment strategy is based on assumptions about occupancy levels rental rates interest rates and other factors and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate our cash flows and profitability may be reduced recent strengthening of the united states economy and job growth coupled with government programs designed to keep homeowners in their homes andor other factors may contribute to an increase in homeownership rather than renting in addition we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets and convert them to productive uses the supply of singlefamily rental properties will decrease which may increase competition for residents limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties a softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability 

we may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

renters impose additional risks to owning real property renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property accordingly renters may damage a property and its contents and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all a rental property may need repairs andor improvements after each resident vacates the premises the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased accordingly the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our results of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the 

relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes including marketing leasing vendor communications finance intercompany communications our resident portals and property management service platforms which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses or experienced computer programmers that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure are subject and may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions due to the nature of some of the attacks there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and implemented processes procedures and internal controls that are designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cyber incidents or security breaches any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings misstated or unreliable financial data liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity these joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed in addition we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control such actions could among other things impact our ability to maintain our status as a reit further investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and 

may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our third party partners or coventurers 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we are involved in a range of legal and regulatory proceedings claims actions inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business these legal and regulatory proceedings may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims these actions can be timeconsuming and expensive and may adversely affect our reputation for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity or wind andor flood risk properties located in active seismic areas include properties throughout california and seattle a number of our properties are also located in texas florida and charlotte which are areas known to be subject to wind andor flood risk while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur casualty losses that are not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position in the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

we are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes or floods may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss of income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area 

when we have geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe such as an earthquake especially in california or destructive weather event such as a hurricane affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next our financial results may be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather 

climate change may adversely affect our business 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather andor changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations 

eminent domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back stock 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the code or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions 

we continue to incur substantial expenses in integrating the legacy swh business into our business 

we incurred substantial accounting financial advisory legal and other costs and the management team devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the mergers we continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the business operations network systems technologies and policies and procedures of the two companies these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

although we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred there are still a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses if the expenses we incur as a result of the mergers are higher than anticipated our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully complete the integration of our business and the legacy swh business and realize the anticipated synergies and other expected benefits of the mergers on the anticipated timeframe or at all 

the mergers involved the combination of two companies which previously operated as independent public companies we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting a public company platform and the 

resulting economies of scale these savings are not expected to be fully realized until we are fully integrated which is not expected to occur until mid2019 we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of our and legacy swh’s business practices and operations the potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 for all these reasons you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations services standards controls and policies and procedures any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with operators vendors and employees to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the mergers 

following the mergers the size of our business is significantly greater than the size of either of the two companies’ businesses prior to the mergers our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated to result from the mergers 

we may have failed to uncover all liabilities of legacy swh business through the due diligence process prior to the mergers exposing us to potentially large unanticipated costs 

prior to completing the mergers we performed certain due diligence reviews of the legacy swh business in view of timing and other considerations relevant to successfully achieving the closing of the mergers our due diligence reviews were necessarily limited in nature and may not adequately have uncovered all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the mergers any such liabilities could cause us to experience potentially significant losses which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in 

acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms and 7 the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures if the income from a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 93385 million  aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

our access to additional third party sources of financing will depend in part on 

 potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing consequently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms if at all 

secured indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder andor the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt andor otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default a default under one of our debt agreements could result in a crossdefault under other debt agreements and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable terminate their commitments require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral in accordance with our facility agreements is not available 

for example our mortgage loans require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash in such cash management account as the lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans 

these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt fina ncings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification in order to generate cash for funding new investments mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings for example accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities and possible changes in accounting rules interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets as well as the debt markets and the economy generally have caused significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgagebacked securities as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets including a significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to 

mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible senior notes or to repurchase the convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible senior notes 

holders of the convertible senior notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change such as certain change in control transactions or recapitalization transactions as defined in the indentures governing the convertible senior notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any we have elected to deliver shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” unless we elect to deliver solely common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 convertible notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 convertible notes surrendered therefor or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes in addition our ability to repurchase the 2022 convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the 2022 convertible notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by future agreements governing our indebtedness the failure to repurchase convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the convertible senior note indentures or to pay any cash due and payable on the convertible senior notes as required by the convertible senior note indentures would constitute a default under the indentures a default under the convertible senior note indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible senior notes or make cash payments thereon 

the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 convertible notes is triggered holders of the 2022 convertible notes will be entitled to convert the 2022 convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their 2022 convertible notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity 

the accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results 

under gaap an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion such as the convertible senior notes in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is recorded as a fair value adjustment to the debt component of the convertible senior notes the adjustment is treated like a discount for accounting purposes and is amortized into interest expense over the term of the convertible senior notes using an effective interest method as a result we will initially be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense because of the amortization of fair value adjustment to the convertible senior notes’ face amount over the term of the convertible senior notes accordingly we will report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period’s amortization of the fair 

value adjustment and the convertible senior notes’ coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible senior notes 

under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the convertible senior notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the “ifconverted” method the effect of which is that the shares of common stock contingently issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent that the conversion value of convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount under the “ifconverted” method for diluted earnings per share purposes convertible debt instruments are accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in stock are issued if such calculation is dilutive to earnings per share for the relevant periods this could adversely affect our reported financial results including our diluted earnings per share 

our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of the 2019 convertible notes 

we have elected to deliver shares of our common stock and cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share upon conversion of the 2019 convertible notes the current conversion price of the 2019 convertible notes is approximately 1852  per share subject to adjustment in certain circumstances if we deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion our stockholders may incur dilution in addition our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2019 convertible notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments totaling 77677 million  as of december 31 2018 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” for more information each 100 basis points “bps” change in interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness would result in a 143 million  change in annual interest expense 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items — complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities” 

increased regulatory oversight uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the capital markets and our ability to raise capital if libor is discontinued our variable rate debt agreements and financial instruments may be calculated using another base rate 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority  “ fca ”  which regulates london interbank offered rate “libor”  announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021  “ fca announcement ”  the fca announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021 we are not able to predict the effect of the fca announcement any changes in the methods pursuant to which libor rates are determined and any other reforms to libor that will be enacted in the united kingdom and elsewhere which may adversely affect the trading market for libor based securities or result in the phasing out of libor as a reference rate for securities in addition any changes announced by the fca including the fca announcement the ice benchmark administration limited the independent administrator of libor or any other successor governance or oversight body or future changes adopted by such body in the method pursuant to which libor rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor rates such changes reforms or replacements relating to libor could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our sponsor may exercise significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

as of february 25 2019  affiliates of our sponsor beneficially owned approximately 42  of our common stock moreover under our amended stockholders’ agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates so long as our preipo owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 5 of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we will nominate a certain number of individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the “sponsor directors” for election to our board of directors as specified in our stockholders’ agreement and our sponsor must consent to any change to the number of our directors sponsor directors may not be removed without the consent of our sponsor and any change in the number of our directors requires the consent of our sponsor 

although our sponsor and its affiliates do not own shares of our stock representing a majority of our total voting power our sponsor is still able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly our sponsor has significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the election and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the singlefamily rental sector in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders our charter provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition our sponsor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 particularly section 404 and the applicable sec rules and regulations that require an annual report of our management on our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports in a timely manner 

if we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the new york stock exchange “nyse” the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control 

certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their shares of common stock including 

 we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl and any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl in addition pursuant to a provision in our bylaws we opted out of the control share provisions of the mgcl provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the mgcl or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in each case without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

in addition the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thencurrent market price our charter provides that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we may 

not elect to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8 including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director 

our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock including preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 

our charter permits our board of directors without any action by our stockholders to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences conversion and other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock which rights may be superior to those of our common stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of stock over the then current market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the convertible senior notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

certain provisions in the convertible senior notes and the related indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change holders of the convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes in cash in addition if a takeover constitutes a makewhole fundamental change we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their convertible senior notes in connection with such takeover in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible senior notes and the indentures could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management 

our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval 

our investment financing borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities including growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by our board of directors these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders our charter also provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit in addition our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements a change in these policies or the termination of our reit election could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law under current maryland law and our charter our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities in addition we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present 

and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests 

our charter contains a provision that expressly permits our sponsor our nonemployee directors and certain of our preipo owners and their affiliates to compete with us 

our sponsor may compete with us for investments in properties and for residents there is no assurance that any conflicts of interest created by such competition will be resolved in our favor moreover our sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and acquires and holds interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates other than to those directors who are employed by us or our subsidiaries unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director and none of our sponsor preipo owners or any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law our sponsor and each of our nonemployee directors including those designated by our sponsor and any of their affiliates may

we are required to disclose in our periodic reports filed with the sec specified activities engaged in by our “affiliates” 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 “itrshra” which expands the scope of united states sanctions against iran more specifically section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving 

iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain office of foreign assets control sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra 

requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under united states law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the united states president and certain united states congressional committees 

the united states president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we would be required to report if we or any of our “affiliates” knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report because the sec defines the term “affiliate” broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be an affiliate of our sponsor affiliates of our sponsor may also be considered our affiliates affiliates of our sponsor have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activity even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business 

risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items 

if we do not maintain our qualification as a reit we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability 

we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the code we could fail to meet various compliance requirements which could jeopardize our reit status furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year then 

 reits in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may become subject to united states federal income taxes and related state and local taxes for example net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a reit a “prohibited transaction” under the code will be subject to a 100 tax we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits similarly if we were to fail an income test and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file united states federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property including income franchise payroll mortgage recording and transfer taxes either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets such as our trss which are subject to full united states federal state local 

and foreign corporatelevel income taxes any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

in order to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences in addition to the quarterly asset test requirements we must annually satisfy two income test requirements the “75 and 95 gross income tests” as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders we may be unable to pursue investments that would otherwise be advantageous to it in order to satisfy the income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a “borrowings hedge” or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income each such hedge a “currency hedge” if clearly identified under applicable united states treasury “treasury” regulations does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit this exclusion from the 95 and 75 gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a borrowings hedge or a currency hedge a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses from hedges held in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs provided however losses in our trs arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 may only be carried forward and may only be deducted against 80 of future taxable income in the trs 

complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 

from time to time our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the code thus we could be required to borrow funds sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative these options could increase our costs or reduce our equity 

even if we qualify to be subject to united states federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to united states federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the builtin gain tax however there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares of stock whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status in addition our board of directors granted an exemption from the ownership limit to our sponsor and its affiliates which may limit our board of directors’ power to increase the ownership limit or grant further exemptions in the future 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends 

in connection with our qualification as a reit we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain in order to satisfy this requirement we may make distributions that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock which could account for up to 90 of the aggregate amount of such distributions at the election of each stockholder taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes as a result united states stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received accordingly united states holders receiving a distribution of our stock may be required to sell stocks received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a united states stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to certain nonunited states holders we may be required to withhold united states tax with respect to such distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service “irs” will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cashstock distributions including on a retroactive basis or assert that the requirements for such taxable cashstock distributions have not been met 

dividends payable by reits do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable by nonreit “c” corporations to certain noncorporate united states stockholders is currently 238 taking into account the 38 medicare tax applicable to net investment income dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 those noncorporate united states stockholders may deduct 20 of their dividends from reits excluding qualified dividend income and capital gains dividends for those united states stockholders in the top marginal tax bracket of 37 the deduction for reit dividends yields an effective income tax rate of 296 on reit dividends which is higher than the 238 tax rate on qualified dividend income paid by nonreit “c” corporations although the legislation benefits the taxation of reits and dividends payable by reits the more favorable rates applicable to nonreit corporate qualified dividends could cause certain noncorporate investors to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including our common stock 

we are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth 

as with other reits but unlike corporations generally our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90 of our reit taxable income in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of united states federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock for 

example the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” has resulted in fundamental changes to the code among the numerous changes included in the tcja is a deduction of 20 of ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 through 2025 we cannot assure you that the tcja or any such changes in the future will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of the tcja on your investment in our stock and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 

to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory 

our ownership of and relationship with any trs will be restricted and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our reit status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax 

a reit may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more trss a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than 20 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss the value of our interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a trs may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 as amended a trs will pay united states federal state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis 

any trs we own as a domestic corporation will pay united states federal state and local income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us the aggregate value of the trs stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets including the trs stock and securities although we plan to monitor our investments in trss there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20 limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above 

recharacterization of leases as financings transactions may negatively affect us 

while we generally intend to use reasonable commercial efforts to structure any lease transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” with us treated as the owner and lessor of the property for federal income tax purposes the irs could challenge such characterization in the event that any lease transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a sellerfinanced conditional sale transaction for federal income tax purposes deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed in addition if we enter such transactions at the reit level in the event of recharacterization the reit could be subject to prohibited transaction taxes finally the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year and require us to pay deficiency dividends interest and penalty taxes in order to maintain reit status 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

we have elected to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets or reduce such distributions if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for united states federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their stock a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s stock they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by market conditions and by our actual and expected future earnings and level of cash dividends 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of stock without regard to our operating performance for example the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates one of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments as a result if interest rates rise it is possible that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interestbearing securities increase in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our stock could decrease significantly the market value of the equity securities of a reit is also based upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales or refinancings and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of stock to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock

dividends   

we have elected to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit and to avoid paying tax on our income we intend to make quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders 

for income tax purposes dividends paid to holders of common stock primarily consist of ordinary income capital gains qualified dividends unrecaptured section 1250 gains and return of capital or a combination thereof for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  dividends per share held for the entire year were estimated to be taxable as follows

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeast united states through disciplined market and asset selection as well as through the mergers we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes   

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior noi growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental market  within our 17   markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately 1850  square feet with three  bedrooms and two  bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are wellpositioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows   

reorganization and initial public offering 

on january 31 2017 we and our preipo owners effected  the preipo transactions that resulted in invh lp holding directly or indirectly all of the assets liabilities and results of operations reflected in our consolidated financial statements including the full portfolio of homes held by the ih holding entities as a result of the preipo transactions invh lp became a consolidated subsidiary of invh a wholly owned subsidiary of invh invitation homes op gp llc serves as invh lp’s sole general partner   

the preipo transactions have been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control utilizing historical cost basis in our 2017 financial statements accordingly after january 31 2017 our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of invh and its wholly owned subsidiaries prior to that date our consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of invh lp and the ih holding entities and their wholly owned subsidiaries

merger with starwood waypoint homes 

on november 16 2017 we completed the mergers with swh we believe that the mergers provide a number of significant potential strategic benefits and opportunities that will be in the best interests of our stockholders more specifically we believe that the mergers created a diversified and highquality portfolio of homes in highgrowth markets potential benefits from economies of scale and the market overlap of invh’s and swh’s complementary portfolios may be derived from optimization of operations reduction of operating costs and other anticipated synergies 

our portfolio 

the following table provides summary information regarding our total and same store portfolios as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  as noted below 







factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control see part i item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals rental rates and occupancy levels turnover rates and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance property acquisitions and renovations and financing arrangements 

market fundamentals   our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 695  of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2018  in recent periods our western united states and florida markets have experienced favorable demand fundamentals with employment growth strong household formation rates and favorable supply fundamentals such as the rate of new supply delivery we believe these supply and demand fundamentals have driven favorable rental rate growth and home price appreciation for our western united states and florida markets in recent periods and we expect these trends to continue in the near to intermediate term 

rental rates and occupancy levels  rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years 

turnover rates and days to reresident  other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents resident turnover rates and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory economic conditions and economic outlook increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period 

property improvements and maintenance  property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

property acquisitions and renovations  future growth in rental revenues and income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental the scope of renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property and whether the property was vacant when acquired due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements  financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense mortgage loans term loan facility revolving facility and convertible debt as well as our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and certain financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms interest rates are impacted by market conditions and the terms of the underlying financing arrangements see 7a “quantitative and qualitative 

disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017  we owned 80807  and 82570  singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio as a result of the mergers an additional 34670  homes were added t o our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2017 during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  we acquired 938  and 910  homes respectively and sold 2701   and   1308  homes respectively during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  we owned an average of 82171  and 52275  singlefamily rental homes respectively 

we believe presenting information about the portion of our total portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business to do so we provide information regarding the performance of our same store portfolio 

as of december 31 2018  our same store portfolio consisted of 68880  singlefamily rental homes in order to provide meaningful comparative information across periods that in some cases predate the mergers all information regarding the performance of the same store portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 is presented as though the mergers were consummated on january 1 2017 ie as though the singlefamily rental homes owned by legacy swh prior to the mergers that are included in our same store portfolio had been owned by legacy ih for the entirety of such periods 

rental revenues and other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  total portfolio rental revenues and other property income  totaled 17230 million  and 10545 million  respectively an increase of 634  driven by the significant increase in the average number of homes owned  an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home an increase in average occupancy and an increase in utilities expense recoveries for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  total portfolio rental revenues totaled 16075 million  and 9949 million  respectively an increase of 616  and other property income was 1154 million  and 595 million  respectively an increase of 939  

average occupancy for the total portfolio was 946  for the year ended december 31 2018  and 947  for the legacy ih total portfolio for year ended december 31 2017  average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018  was 1735  compared to 1691  for the legacy ih total portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  a 26  increase for our same store portfolio average occupancy was 959  and 954  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively and average monthly rent per occupied home for the year ended december 31 2018  was 1741  compared to 1676  for the year ended december 31 2017  a 39  increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized concessions to calculate net effective rental rate growth leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays nonservice rent for a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home 

renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 48  and 52  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 33  and 36  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively for our same store portfolio renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 48  and 52  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 33  and 35  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

the annual turnover rate for the same store portfolio for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  was 327  and 358  respectively for the same store portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 47  and 46  days between residents for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  the increase in other property income was driven by the significant increase in the average number of homes owned  another primary driver of the increase was utilities expense recoveries which increased as more utilities remained in our name compared to prior year additionally the terms of new leases require residents to reimburse us for those costs 

expenses 

for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  total expenses were 17846 million  and 11932 million  respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased  to 6554 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  from 3915 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  driven by the significant increase in the average number of homes owned  

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased  to 1642 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  from 2111 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 517 million  which was driven by 120 million  of vesting of class b units and 569 million   of awards  issued in connection with the ipo during the year ended december 31 2017  property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased for the year ended december 31 2018  by an additional 83 million  due to ipo related costs during the year ended december 31 2017  and a 167 million  decrease of merger and transactionrelated expenses including severance incurred during  the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the previous year these decreases were partially offset by additional expenses due to the increase in the number of homes owned 

interest expense was 3836 million  and 2570 million  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average debt balances outstanding during the year ended december 31 2018  primarily related to debt assumed in connection with the mergers due to refinancing of and prepayments made on the mortgage loans during the year ended december 31 2018 debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts decreased to 92498 million  as of december 31 2018  from 96517 million  as of december 31 2017  additionally the average onemonth libor rate increased by 88 bps to 202  during the year ended december 31 2018  from 114  during the year ended december 31 2017  which was partially offset by reductions in the weighted average spread inclusive of servicing fees over libor resulting from refinancing activity 

depreciation and amortization expense increased  to 5605 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  from 3096 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to the addition of 34670 homes acquired in the mergers and the amortization of inplace leases 

impairment and other expenses decreased  to 208 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  from 241 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  l osses and damages related to hurricanes irma and harvey of 80 million  and 215 million  for the y ears ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively are included within impairment and other expenses 

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property was 497 million  and 339 million  f or the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively  the primary driver for the difference in the gain on sale between periods was the number of and composition of the portfolio of homes sold during the respective periods of the 2701  homes sold during the year ended december 31 2018  1497  homes were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 242 million  the additional 1204  homes sold during the year ended december 31 2018  sold for a net gain of 255 million  of the 1308  homes sold during the   year ended december 31 2017  454  homes were sold in two bulk sales for a gain of 95 million  the additional 597  homes sold in the year ended december 31 2017  were sold for a net gain of 244 million  

year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we owned 82570 and 48298 singlefamily rental homes respectively in our total portfolio as of december 31 2017 the legacy ih portfolio accounted for 47917 of the 82570 total owned homes as a result of the mergers an additional 34670 homes were added to our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the impact of the mergers during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we acquired 910 and 1253 homes respectively and we sold 1308 and 1093 homes during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively as of december 31 2017 our same store portfolio was comprised of 42689 homes from the legacy ih portfolio 

rental revenues and other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 t otal portfolio rental revenues and other property income  totaled 10545 million  and 9226 million  respectively an increase of 143  driven by increases in average occupancy average monthly rent per occupied home and revenues generated from properties acquired in the mergers partially offset by a decrease in the number of homes owned in the legacy ih total portfolio 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we generated rental revenues of 9949 million and 8780 million respectively during the year ended december 31 2017 the legacy ih total portfolio contributed 9157 million  of our total rental revenues an increase of 43 due to an increase in both average occupancy and average monthly rent per occupied home partially offset by a decrease in number of homes owned the mergers generated rental revenues of 792 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

average occupancy for the legacy ih total portfolio was 947 and 945 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in average occupancy correlates with the decrease in the number of homes acquired during 2017 compared to 2016 as homes are unoccupied for a longer period of time during initial renovations than during a reresident period average monthly rent per occupied home for the legacy ih total portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017 was 1691 compared to 1611 for the year ended december 31 2016 a 50 increase 

for our legacy ih same store portfolio our average occupancy was 957 and 961 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively and our average monthly rent per occupied home for the year ended december 31 2017 was 1694 compared to 1626 for the year ended december 31 2016 a 42 increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the monthly same home in each case net of any amortized rent concessions leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home the following information regarding our renewal leases and new leases is with respect to the legacy ih total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the legacy ih total portfolio averaged 51 and 55 respectively for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 new lease net effective rental rate growth for the legacy ih total portfolio averaged 36 and 55 respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the turnover rate for the legacy ih same store portfolio was 346 and 349 respectively for the legacy ih total portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 47 and 42 days between residents for each of the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 other property income was 595 million and 446 million respectively with the legacy ih portfolio comprising 541 million of other property income for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 213 the primary drivers of the increase were pet rent and late fee income attributable to the implementation of our national lease for all leases written beginning in february 2016 and the automation and consistent application of these fees beginning in march 2017 other property income of 54 million was attributable to the homes acquired in the mergers 

expenses 

total expenses were 11932 million  and 10179 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased to 3915 million for the year ended december 31 2017 from 3603 million for the year ended december 31 2016 due to the increase in the number of homes owned in 2017 the legacy ih portfolio comprised 3605 million of the property operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 which is relatively unchanged from 2016 legacy ih portfolio expenses were relatively flat as increases in property taxes for homes owned in both periods were offset by reduced marketlevel personnel expense property operating and maintenance expenses of 310 million is attributable to homes acquired in the mergers 

property management expense and general and administrative expense increased to 2111 million for the year ended december 31 2017 from 996 million for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 710 million and merger and transactionrelated expenses of   298 million   incurred during the   year ended december 31 2017 

interest expense was 2570 million and 2860 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively with interest expense related to indebtedness incurred prior to the mergers comprising 2397 million a decrease of 162 from the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in average debt balances outstanding during 2017 this was partially offset by an increase in our weighted average cost of debt due to an increase in the average monthly libor rates of 63 bps from 051 to 114 during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2017 respectively the decrease in average debt balances outstanding during the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily attributable to net reductions in debt from the use of a portion of our net ipo proceeds together with the borrowings under the term loan facility to repay all of our then existing credit facilities and certain of our mortgage loans as of december 31 2017 we had 96517 million of debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts compared to 75703 million as of december 31 2016 

depreciation and amortization expense increased due to higher average cost basis per home as of december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 and the addition of 34670 homes acquired in the mergers 

impairment and other expenses increased to 241 million for the year ended december 31 2017 from 42 million for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to losses and damages related to hurricane irma 

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property was 339 million and 186 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively an increase of 823 of the 1308 homes sold during the year ended december 31 2017 454 were sold in bulk 

sales for a gain of 95 million of the 1093 homes sold during the year ended december 31 2016 590 homes were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 94 million the primary driver for the difference in the gain on sale between periods was the composition of homes sold during the respective periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2018  and 2017  included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1449 million  and 1799 million  respectively a 194   decrease  due primarily to payments on our mortgage loans and investments in singlefamily residential properties which is discussed in further detail in “—cash flows” additionally the total balance of our 10000 million  revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” remained undrawn as of december 31 2018  

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make distributions and dividend payments to our stockholders and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i renovating newlyacquired homes ii funding hoa fees as applicable property taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance of our homes iii interest expense and iv payment of dividends to our equity investors our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal payments on our indebtedness 

we intend to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions we believe our rental income net of total expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a nearterm basis our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives such as the revolving facility which had an undrawn balance of 10000 million  as of december 31 2018  

as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

the following describes the key terms of our current indebtedness 

mortgage loans 

our securitization transactions the “securitizations” or the “mortgage loans” are collateralized by certain homes owned by   wholly owned subsidiaries that were formed to facilitate certain of our financing arrangements the “borrower entities”   we utilize the proceeds from our securitizations to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness ii initial deposits into securitization reserve accounts iii closing costs in connection with the mortgage loans iv general costs associated with our operations and v distributions and dividends in addition to the securitization transactions we initiated we assumed certain mortgage loans from swh in connection with the mergers 

the following table sets forth a summary of our mortgage loan indebtedness as of   december 31 2018  and 2017  





 securitization transactions   

for each securitization transaction the borrower entity executed a loan agreement with a third party lender except for ih 20171 each mortgage loan consists of five  to seven  components the components are floating rate except with respect to certain components we were required to retain in connection with risk retention rules the two  year initial terms are individually subject to   three  to five  one year extension options at the borrower entity’s discretion such extensions are 

available provided there is no continuing event of default under the respective mortgage loan agreement and the borrower entity obtains and delivers a replacement interest rate cap agreement from an approved counterparty within the required timeframe to the lender ih 20171 is a 10 year fixed rate mortgage loan comprised of two  components certificates issued by the trust in connection with component a of ih 20171 benefit from the federal national mortgage association’s guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest 

certain components of our mortgage loans were sold at a discount and 30 million  and 33 million  of unamortized discount is included in mortgage loans net on our consolidated balance sheets as of both december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

each mortgage loan is secured by a pledge of the equity in the assets of the respective borrower entities as well as firstpriority mortgages on the underlying properties and a grant of security interests in all of the related personal property as of   december 31 2018  and 2017  a total of 41644  and 47616  homes respectively were pledged pursuant to the mortgage loans we are obligated to make monthly payments of interest for each mortgage loan and cah 20141 also required monthly payments of principal 

transactions with trusts   

concurrent with the execution of each mortgage loan agreement the respective third party lender sold each loan it originated to individual depositor entities the “depositor entities” who subsequently transferred each loan to securitizationspecific trust entities the “trusts” the depositor entities for our securitizations currently outstanding are wholly owned subsidiaries   

as consideration for the transfer of each loan to the trusts the trusts issued certificate classes which mirror the components of the individual loan agreements collectively the “certificates” to the depositor entities except that class r certificates do not have related loan components as they represent residual interests in the trusts the certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trusts following receipt of the certificates the depositor entities sold the certificates to investors and used the proceeds as consideration for the loans sold to the depositor entities by the lenders these transactions had no effect on our consolidated financial statements other than with respect to certificates we retained in connection with securitizations or purchased at a later date   

the trusts are structured as passthrough entities that receive interest and in the case of cah 20141 principal payments from the securitizations and distribute those payments to the holders of the certificates the assets held by the trusts are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of those entities the obligations of the trusts do not have any recourse to the general credit of any entities in these consolidated financial statements we have evaluated our interests in certain certificates of the trusts held by us discussed below and determined that they do not create a more than insignificant variable interest in the trusts additionally the retained certificates do not provide us with any ability to direct the activities that could impact the trusts’ economic performance therefore we do not consolidate the trusts 

retained certificates   

beginning in april 2014  the trusts made certificates available for sale to both domestic and foreign investors with the introduction of foreign investment sponsors of the mortgage loans are required to retain a portion of the risk that represents a material net economic interest in each loan these requirements were further refined in december 2016 pursuant to regulation rr the “risk retention rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as such loan sponsors are now required to retain a portion of the credit risk that represents not less than 5  of the aggregate fair value of the loan as of the closing date 

to fulfill these requirements class g certificates for ih 20151 ih 20152 ih 20153 cah 20151 csh 20161 and csh 20162 were issued in an amount equal to 5  of the original principal amount of the loans per the terms of the mortgage loan agreements the class g certificates were restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to the sponsor as applicable we retained these class g certificates during the time the related securitizations were outstanding and they were principal only bearing a stated interest rate of 00005  additionally in certain instances we elected to purchase certain class f certificates which bore a stated annual interest rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 373  to 508  

for ih 20171 the class b certificates are restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to invh lp in order to comply with the risk retention rules the class b certificates bear a stated annual interest rate of 423  including applicable servicing fees 

for swh 20171 ih 20172 ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 we retained 5  of each certificate class to meet the risk retention rules these retained certificates accrue interest at a floating rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 076  to 347  

the  retained certificates total 3666 million  and 3785 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and are classified as held to maturity investments and recorded in other assets net on the consolidated balance sheets  

loan covenants 

the general terms that apply to all of the mortgage loans require us to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants with which we must comply include our and certain of our affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the mortgage loan agreements ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which we and certain of our affiliates are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the respective mortgage loan agreements negative covenants with which we must comply include our and certain of our affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of our indebtedness and the nature of our investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager and iv the nature of our business activities as of december 31 2018  and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe we are in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants   

prepayments   

for the mortgage loans prepayments of amounts owed by us are generally not permitted under the terms of the respective mortgage loan agreements unless such prepayments are made pursuant to the voluntary election or mandatory provisions specified in such agreements the specified mandatory provisions become effective to the extent that a property becomes characterized as a disqualified property a property is sold andor upon the occurrence of a condemnation or casualty event associated with a property to the extent either a voluntary election is made or a mandatory prepayment condition exists in addition to paying all interest and principal we must also pay certain breakage costs as determined by the loan servicer and a spread maintenance premium if prepayment occurs before the month following the one or two year anniversary of the closing dates of each of the mortgage loans except for ih 20171 for ih 20171 prepayments on or before december 2026 will require a yield maintenance premium for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  we made voluntary and mandatory prepayments of   45796 million  29510 million  and 421 million  respectively under the terms of the mortgage loan agreements 

term loan facility and revolving facility 

on february 6 2017 we entered into a credit facility the “credit facility” which was amended on december 18 2017 to include entities and homes acquired in the mergers the credit facility provides 25000 million  of borrowing capacity and consists of the 10000 million  revolving facility which will mature on february 6 2021 with a one year extension option and a 15000 million  term loan facility the “term loan facility” which will mature on february 6 2022 the revolving facility also includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings in each case subject to certain sublimits the credit facility provides us with the option to enter into additional incremental credit facilities including an uncommitted incremental facility that provides us with the option to increase the size of the revolving facility andor the term loan facility by an aggregate amount of up to   15000 million   subject to certain limitations proceeds from the term loan facility were used to repay thenoutstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes proceeds from the revolving facility are used for general corporate purposes 

the following table sets forth a summary of the outstanding principal amounts under the credit facility as of december 31 2018  and 2017  





 interest rate and fees 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a libor rate determined by reference to the bloomberg libor rate or comparable or successor rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or b a base rate determined by reference to the highest of 1 the administrative agent’s prime lending rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3 the libor rate that would be payable on such day for a libor rate loan with a onemonth interest period plus   100  the margin is based on a total leverage based grid the margin for the revolving facility ranges from   075  to 130  in the case of base rate loans and   175  to 230  in the case of libor rate loans the margin for the term loan facility ranges from 070   to 130   in the case of base rate loans and 170  to   230  in the case of libor rate loans in addition the credit facility provides that upon receiving an investment grade rating on its noncredit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt of bbb or better from standard  poor’s rating services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc or baa3 or better from moody’s investors service inc an “investment grade rating event” we may elect to convert to a credit rating based pricing grid 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving facility in respect of the unused commitments thereunder the facility fee rate is based on the daily unused amount of the revolving facility and is either   035  or 020   per annum based on the unused facility amount upon converting to a credit rating pricing based grid the unused facility fee will no longer apply and we will be required to pay a facility fee ranging from 0125  to 0300  we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees 

prepayments and amortization 

no  principal reductions are required under the credit facility we are permitted to voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the term loan facility at any time without premium or penalty subject to certain minimum amounts and the payment of customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans once repaid no   further borrowings will be permitted under the term loan facility 

loan covenants   

the credit facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default such covenants will among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability and that of the subsidiary guarantors as defined below and their respective subsidiaries to i engage in certain mergers consolidations or liquidations ii sell lease or transfer all or substantially all of their respective assets iii engage in certain transactions with affiliates iv make changes to our fiscal year v make changes in the nature of our business and our subsidiaries and vi incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the credit facility

general terms   

we may not redeem the convertible senior notes prior to their maturity dates except to the extent necessary to preserve our status as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes as further described in the indentures if we undergo a fundamental change as defined in the indentures holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible senior notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to   100   of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date

certain hedging arrangements 

from time to time we enter into derivative instruments to manage the economic risk of changes in interest rates we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and for which we have elected to designate them as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or which we did not elect to designate as accounting hedges 

designated hedges 

we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variablerate interest payments certain of the invitation homes partnerships and certain borrower entities guaranteed the obligations under each of the interest rate swaps from the date the swaps were entered into through the date of the ipo each of these swaps was accounted for as a nondesignated hedge until january 31 2017 when the criteria for hedge accounting were met as a result of the preipo transactions  at that time we designated these swaps for hedge accounting purposes subsequent to that date changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 

in addition in connection with the mergers we acquired various interest rate swap instruments which we designated for hedge accounting purposes on the merger date we recorded these interest rate swaps at their aggregate estimated fair value of 211 million  over the terms of each of these swaps an amount equal to the merger date fair value will be amortized and recorded as an increase in interest expense and accumulated other comprehensive income 

the table below summarizes our interest rate swap instruments as of   december 31 2018   in thousands 



during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variablerate interest payments amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variablerate debt during the next 12 months we estimate that   387 million  will be reclassified to earnings as a decrease in interest expense 

nondesignated hedges 

concurrent with entering into certain of the mortgage loan agreements and in connection with the mergers we entered into or acquired and maintain interest rate cap agreements with terms and notional amounts equivalent to the terms and amounts of the mortgage loans made by the third party lenders  to the extent that the maturity date of one or more of the mortgage loans is extended through an exercise of one or more of the extension options replacement or extension interest rate cap agreements must be executed with terms similar to those associated with the initial interest rate cap agreements and strike prices equal to the greater of the interest rate cap strike price and the interest rate at which the debt service coverage ratio as defined is not less than   12  to 10  the interest rate cap agreements including all of our rights to payments owed by the counterparties and all other rights have been pledged as additional collateral for the mortgage loans   additionally in certain instances in order to minimize the cash impact of purchasing required interest rate caps we simultaneously sold interest rate caps which have identical terms and notional amounts such that the purchase price and sale proceeds of the related interest rate caps are intended to offset each other  the purchased and sold interest rates caps have strike prices ranging from approximately 300  to   512  

purchase of outstanding debt securities or loans 

as market conditions warrant we and our equity investors and members of our management may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans or debt securities that we may issue in the future in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans the amounts involved in any such purchase transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series in addition any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” as defined for united states federal income tax purposes may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us which amounts may be material and in related adverse tax consequences to us 

cash flows 

year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017   

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended   december 31 2018 and 2017  



operating activities 

our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our homes the rental rates achieved on our leases the collection of rent from our residents and the amount of our operating and other expenses net cash provided by operating activities  was 5612 million  and 2630 million  for the years ended   december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively an increase  of 1134  the increase  in cash provided by operating activities was 

primarily driven by the significant increase in the number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the previous year 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities primarily consists of the acquisition costs of homes capital improvements proceeds from property sales and the impact of cash acquired in the mergers net cash provided by investing activities was 630 million  and 647 million  for the years ended   december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively a decrease of 26  the slight decrease in net cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from several factors which offset each other 1 2035 million  of cash and restricted cash we acquired as a result of the mergers during the year ended december 31 2017 2 higher acquisition and capital expenditure spend for the year ended december 31 2018 3 an increase in proceeds from the sale of homes during the year ended december 31 2018 and 4 net change in the balance of our investments in debt securities acquisition and renovation spend increased 270 million  due to an increase  in the number and costs of homes acquired from 910  homes during the year ended december 31 2017  to 938  homes during the year ended december 31 2018  and the completion of initial renovations for homes acquired prior to december 31 2017 the 832 million  increase in other capital expenditures was driven by the significant increase in the number of homes owned  during the year ended december 31 2018  and higher capital expenditures on a per home basis these changes were partially offset by proceeds from sales of homes that increased 2847 million  from the year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2018  due to an increase in the average proceeds per home sold and a significant increase  in the number of homes sold from 1308  to 2701  respectively additionally net cash flows from our purchases of investments in debt securities and receipt of repayment proceeds from investments in debt securities increased  by 282 million  due to refinancing of and prepayments made on the mortgage loans during the year ended december 31 2018

net cash used in financing activities  was 6808 million  and 3313 million  for the years ended   december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively during the year ended december 31 2018  proceeds from our ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 mortgage loans of 42345 million  along with proceeds from home sales and operating cash flows were used to repay 45796 million  of our mortgage loans including full repayment of the cah 20141 cah 20142 cah 20151 csh 20161 ih 20151 ih 20152 and ih 20153 mortgage loans and partial repayments on csh 20162 350 million  of our revolving facility to fund 557 million  of deferred financing costs associated with the ih 20181 ih 20182 ih 20183 and ih 20184 mortgage loans and for dividend payments which totaled 2301 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  proceeds from our ipo term loan facility revolving facility and the ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans of 51885 million  along with proceeds from home sales and operating cash flows were used to repay 23216 million  of thenoutstanding credit facilities and 29510 million  of thenoutstanding mortgage loans including full repayment of the ih 20131 ih 20141 ih 20142 and ih 20143 mortgage loans to fund 546 million  of deferred financing costs associated with the term loan facility the revolving facility and the ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans and for dividend payments which totaled 690 million  

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  



operating activities 

our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our homes the rental rates achieved on our leases the collection of rent from our residents and the amount of our operating and other expenses net cash provided by operating activities  was 2630 million  and 2561 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively an increase  of 27  cash provided by operating activities included cash from operations of 2920 million  and 2564 million  and 290 million  and 03 million  from other changes in operating assets and liabilities for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase  in cash from operations was primarily attributable to an increase  of 1007 million  in net operating income partially offset by 251 million  of incremental ipo and merger and transactionrelated expenses compared to 2016  and 215 million  of hurricane related damages recorded in 2017  

investing activities 

net cash provided by used in investing activities primarily consists of the acquisition costs of homes capital improvements proceeds from property sales and the impact of cash acquired in the mergers net cash provided by used in investing activities was 647 million and 2580 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively leading to an increase in cash provided by investing activities of 3227 million between the years the increase was primarily due to the cash and restricted cash we acquired as a result of the mergers of 2035 million and repayment proceeds received from our retained debt securities of 793 million additionally there was a decrease in the number of homes acquired from 1253 homes during the year ended december 31 2016 to 910 homes during the year ended december 31 2017 which resulted in 574 million less in acquisition renovation and capital expenditure spend the increase in number of homes sold during 2017 of 1308 compared to 1093 homes during the year ended december 31 2016 resulted in an increase in the amount of proceeds from sale of residential properties of 629 million the changes above were partially offset by an increase in investments in debt securities of 791 million resulting from the application of risk retention rules to our ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  consisted of the following 







critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recentlyissued and adopted accounting standards see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

investments in singlefamily residential properties 

the following significant accounting policies affect the acquisition disposition recognition classification and fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis related to our portfolio of approximately 80000 singlefamily residential properties in 17 markets across the united states  for a complete discussion of our accounting policy and other factors related to each category below see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules — note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements” 

 once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions 

the capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis  the weighted average useful lives range from 7 years to 285 years if the useful lives for costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2018 were increased or decreased by 10  our annualized depreciation expense would have changed by approximately 30 million  



derivatives 

we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements collectively “hedging derivatives” for interest rate risk management purposes we do not enter into hedging derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes and all of our hedging derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and that we have elected to designate as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or that we have not elected to designate as hedges 

we utilize third party specialists who use modeling techniques and assumptions to estimate the fair value of derivative instruments assumptions include forward yield curves and nonperformance risk if interest rates had increased or decreased by 50 bps  the termination value of our net derivative assetliability would have changed by approximately 1600 million  as our interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedges this change would be reflected in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings our interest rates caps would not be materially affected 

segment reporting   

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker “codm” in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer 

under the provision of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties including singlefamily homes in planned unit developments the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes noi as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level 

nongaap measures 

ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare 

ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap before the following items interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit”  recommends as a best practice that reits that report an ebitda performance measure also report ebitda re in all financial reports for periods beginning after december 31 2017 we define ebitda re  consistent with the nareit definition as ebitda further adjusted for gain  loss on sale of property net of tax and impairment on depreciated real estate investments 

adjusted ebitda re  is defined as ebitda re  before the following items sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance casualty losses net acquisition costs and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  is net income or loss ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  may not be comparable to the ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with gaap to ebitda ebitda re  and adjusted ebitda re  for each of the periods indicated 





 net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses repairs and maintenance leasing costs and marketing expense noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization general and administrative expense property management expense impairment and other acquisition costs gain on sale of property net of tax and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with gaap to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio for each of the periods indicated 





 funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by nareit as net income or loss computed in accordance 

with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes as well noncontrolling interests from net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in homes however because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs loan discounts noncash interest expense for derivatives sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance expense casualty losses net and acquisition costs as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain the functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo no adjustments were made to the core ffo and adjusted ffo per common share —  diluted computations for contingently issuable shares of common stock related to the convertible senior notes accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that 

we may borrow under the credit facility in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2018  our outstanding variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 62677 million  and term loan facility of 15000 million  for a combined total of 77677 million  we effectively converted 788  of these borrowings to a fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements additionally all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt the projected effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in libor on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase or decrease of 143 million  or 163 million  respectively this estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements interest rate cap agreements and any libor floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeastern united states through disciplined market and asset selection we and prior to the mergers swh designed our portfolios to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes 

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior noi growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental market within our 17   markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately   1850   square feet with   three   bedrooms and   two   bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident as of   december 31 2017  we have invested approximately   12 billion   in the upfront renovation of homes in the legacy ih portfolio representing approximately   25000   per home in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are well positioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows   

our platform 

our vertically integrated scalable platform allows greater influence over the experience of our residents while enabling us to better control operating costs and continuously share best practices across functional areas of the business our differentiated platform is built upon 

 our approach to investment and asset management similarly combines local presence and expertise with national oversight our investment and asset management teams are located inmarket and apply their local market knowledge within 

the framework of a proprietary and consistent underwriting methodology through the integration of investment and asset management and property management functions our platform enables our teams to incorporate realtime information regarding leasing activity property operations maintenance and capital spending into asset selection we believe the advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise have driven the quality of our existing portfolio of 82570  homes as of december 31 2017  we believe that employing experienced inhouse acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize riskadjusted total return 

our business activities 

since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes our differentiated approach which combines a residentcentric focus local market presence and expertise and national strategy infrastructure and standards informs all areas of our operations 

merger with starwood waypoint homes 

on november 16 2017 we completed the mergers with swh we believe that the mergers provide a number of significant potential strategic benefits and opportunities that will be in the best interests of our stockholders more specifically we believe that the mergers created a diversified and highquality portfolio of homes in highgrowth markets potential benefits from economies of scale and the market overlap of invh’s and swh’s complementary portfolios may be derived from optimization of operations reduction of operating costs and other anticipated synergies   see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” notes 1 8 and 15 for additional information about the mergers   

property operations 

property operations encompasses the inhouse local market management and execution of marketing leasing resident relations and maintenance functions we have developed and employ a highly scalable vertically integrated residentcentric property management platform all of our property management functions have been internally managed since our founding in 2012 and we have developed an extensive property management infrastructure including systems dedicated inmarket personnel and local offices in each of our markets all of our local market personnel are supported by our centralized national infrastructure which allows us to deploy best practices and standardization where appropriate the combination of our local market presence and national infrastructure enables us to exercise greater control over our property management platform allowing us to enhance the experience of our residents better manage operating costs and share best practices across various functional areas of our business 

we have organized our inhouse property management personnel and operating structure according to a “community model” whereby vice presidents of operations in each of our markets are responsible for the operations of local leasing management property management and maintenance teams we believe our “community model” differentiates our approach to local market operations and enables us to provide superior hightouch resident service maximize the effectiveness of our inmarket personnel in managing rental occupancy and turnover rates and improve our cost management and oversight over both upfront renovations and ongoing maintenance 

marketing and leasing 

our inhouse personnel are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received andor showings a property has experienced since becoming available and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including our proprietary website internet listing services such as zillow trulia hotpads and realtorcom mls yard signs social and 

other digital media and local brokers we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and utilize both a centralized leasing team and inmarket leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes in some markets we also utilize a network of local real estate agents to show homes to prospective residents and offer those agents limited cobroker fees 

prospective residents may submit an application through the application portal on our website or in person in order to maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements we utilize standardized online applications national lease agreements movein and moveout documents resident communications and other ancillary documents we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of third party resident screening vendor partners our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity although we require a minimum income to rent ratio many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process including eviction history criminal history and rental and other payment history 

our disciplined investment strategy and local inmarket approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods enabling us to execute demographic and geotargeted digital advertising we believe this will increase our likelihood of capturing and retaining qualified residents whose lifestyle and purchasing power enhance our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services 

digital marketing initiatives and branding 

we encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website blog and social media accounts with articles home maintenance advice contests and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes for example we alert our residents to prepare for storms and incentivize them to pay their rent online 

resident relations and property maintenance 

our inhouse personnel in each of our markets are also responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations in coordination with a third party vendor we offer a 247 emergency line to handle after hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed and our residents can also contact us through our online resident portal our call centers or our local property management offices as part of our ongoing property management process we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner as appropriate by appointment at the resident’s convenience we seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize longterm rental income and cash flows from our portfolio 

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance personnel in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing hvac plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners a majority of our maintenance calls are addressed by our inhouse maintenance technicians but in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance personnel provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse property management personnel conduct periodic visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventative maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations 

we have developed a number of policies and programs designed to improve the efficiency of our property maintenance practices and maximize resident satisfaction with our service model when a new resident moves into one of our homes our inhouse personnel conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a post movein maintenance visit during the movein orientation each resident is encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items noted after moving into the home at the time of the post movein maintenance visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel will address any service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of 

multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance personnel finally the post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance personnel in each of our markets also conduct midlease preventive maintenance visits during preventive maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance personnel inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could cause us to incur significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventive maintenance visits include smoke and radon detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct pre moveout inspections 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these inspections allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these inspections allow our inhouse property maintenance personnel to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these inspections also increase our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance personnel to assess and document interior and exterior condition whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could cause us to incur significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously we and prior to the mergers swh selected our 17   current markets and assembled our current portfolio based on a robust market selection process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 17  markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base and will experience robust longterm demand and benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze numerous factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams are comprised of dedicated professionals located in our markets and at our corporate headquarters in dallas texas who provide strategic direction and broad oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria to date we have underwritten over one million individual homes which gives us a substantial proprietary database on which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets the number of homes underwritten represents the total number of acquisition opportunities that we have considered and conducted preliminary analysis of including acquisition opportunities that were ultimately not pursued or completed as a result of our 

selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local real estate brokers and others and leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinate with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated personnel located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes with support from centralized construction experts and infrastructure this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals evaluate the structural needs of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of our homes’ fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental occupancy or turnover rates 

through local oversight by inhouse personnel of the entire process of renovating our homes we are able to drive cost efficiencies each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages approximately 4900  homes per market as of december 31 2017  allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale 

corporate responsibility 

our mission statement is “together with you we make a house a home” we recognize that the vitality of our business is directly linked to the vitality of the communities in which we operate as of december 31 2017  we have invested approximately   12 billion   in the upfront renovation of homes in the legacy ih portfolio representing approximately   25000  per home we believe that the investments we make and the high standards to which we renovate and maintain our homes benefit our communities creating jobs and improving the overall quality of life for our residents and their neighbors we believe such investments improve our relationships with local communities and hoas and enhance our brand recognition and loyalty by offering quality homes in attractive neighborhoods we believe we give residents the choice to rent a home in a community that may not have otherwise been attainable 

we believe in doing business with a purpose since our inception we have operated to benefit our residents our employees and our communities by deeply embedding our values ethics and integrity into all that we do the way we think act partner and execute is guided by our values our code of business conduct and ethics is posted on our corporate website and explains how we integrate our purpose mission and values into our daily decisions it demonstrates our commitment to our stakeholders to be a responsible corporate citizen and a good business partner 

we support social and environmental initiatives particularly in our operations and communities we strive to manage and minimize negative impacts throughout the value chain where possible and work on developing sustainable business practices through our organization we believe that we can respond to local and global environmental challenges by combining our strengths in sustainability innovation and partnership 

preipo transactions and mergers 

on january 31 2017 we and our preipo owners effected  certain transactions the “preipo transactions” that resulted in invh lp holding directly or indirectly all of the assets liabilities and results of operations reflected in our consolidated financial statements including the full portfolio of homes held by the ih holding entities as a result of the preipo transactions invh lp became a consolidated subsidiary of invh a whollyowned subsidiary of invh invitation homes op gp llc serves as invh lp’s sole general partner 

the preipo transactions have been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control utilizing historical cost basis in our 2017 financial statements accordingly after january 31 2017 our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of invh and its whollyowned subsidiaries prior to that date our consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of invh lp and the ih holding entities and their whollyowned subsidiaries   

on february 6 2017 invitation homes inc changed its jurisdiction of incorporation to maryland the preipo transactions also included amendments to the invitation homes inc charter which provide for the issuance of up to 9000000000 shares of common stock

risk management 

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties we 

believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team since commencing our operations allow us to monitor manage and ultimately mitigate these risks for example we seek to minimize bad debt expense through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing automated clearing house which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the collection of a majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month

we maintain property casualty and corporatelevel insurance coverage related to our business including general liability business auto umbrella commercial crime directors’ and officers’ liability fiduciary liability cyber liability employment practices liability and workers’ compensation insurance we believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and industry practice however our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage exclusions and we are selfinsured up to the amount of such deductibles and exclusions see part i item 1a “risk factors—risks related to our business and industry—we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance” 

systems and technology 

effective systems and technology are essential components of our business we have made significant investments in our lease management construction management property and corporate accounting and asset management systems these systems have been designed to be scalable to accommodate continued growth in our portfolio of singlefamily homes for lease our website is fully integrated into our resident accounting and leasing system from our website which is accessible from mobile devices prospective residents can browse homes available for rent request additional information and apply to rent a specific home through our online resident portal and native mobile applications existing residents can set up automatic payments and request maintenance service our system is designed to handle the accounting requirements of residential property accounting including accounting for security deposits and paying propertylevel expenses the system also interfaces with our third party resident screening vendor partner to expedite evaluations of prospective residents’ rental applications we have worked with a search engine optimization firm to ensure we place high in search engine lists and will continue to monitor our placement on search engines in addition sponsored key words are generally purchased in selected markets as needed 

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and renting our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties for investment purposes are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be rented or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other real estate investment trusts “reits” that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form 10k describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 

 • the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

• changes in laws including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates 



 any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline significantly 

we  have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

 in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we  may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of over 80000 homes as of december 31 2017  our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 

 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a  significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as real estate taxes hoa fees personal and property taxes insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market by contrast our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing  property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

we  have recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we have recorded consolidated net losses in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may likely continue to record net losses in future periods 

we  are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel  

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel we are also required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of our and legacy swh’s business practices and operations competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changing demographics and changes in employment legislation if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or our labor costs increase significantly our business operations and our financial performance could be adversely impacted 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause the value of our common stock to decline  

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our singlefamily properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

 we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions or renovations result in significant costs or delays and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements additionally such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant  relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability 

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown 

rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

we  may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosurerelated issues and with the increased market for homes arising from displaced homeownership some of these organizations may shift their litigation lobbying fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlordresident issues while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly possessed renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we also make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of time to possession renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as heating ventilation and air conditioning systems “hvac” roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

we have entered into a threeyear contract with a third party vendor to provide certain services for our properties because of the large volume of services under this contract only a limited number of companies are capable of servicing our needs on this scale accordingly the inability or unwillingness of this vendor to continue to provide these services on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer 

we rely on the systems of our third party service providers their ability to perform key operations on our behalf in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed levels of service and their ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to perform our work a failure in the systems of one of our third party service providers or their inability to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts or to retain sufficient qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers will reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer in the event of failure by our general contractors to pay their subcontractors our properties may be subject to filings of mechanics or materialmen liens which we may need to resolve to remain in compliance with certain debt covenants and for which indemnification from the general contractors may not be available 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets as a result we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in “as is” condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home the holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and timeconsuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation 

allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk since we do not obtain title insurance policies for properties we acquire through the auction process until we place the property into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance once an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly do not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and no title insurance protection will be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection 

may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in this manner we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates bulk portfolio acquisitions are also more complex than singlefamily home acquisitions and we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully the costs involved in locating and performing due diligence when feasible on portfolios of homes as well as negotiating and entering into transactions with potential portfolio sellers could be significant and there is a risk that either the seller may withdraw from the entire transaction for failure to come to an agreement or the seller may not be willing to sell us the bulk portfolio on terms that we view as favorable in addition a seller may require that a group of homes be purchased as a package even though we may not want to purchase certain individual assets in the bulk portfolio 

moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and   we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and rent such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid real estate tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities for which we may be obligated but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be 

subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this will necessarily be an available option or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs of lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from renting such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties several states have enacted laws that provide that a lien for unpaid monies owed to an hoa may be senior to or extinguish mortgage liens on properties such actions if not cured may give rise to events of default under certain of our indebtedness which could have a material adverse impact on us 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we may be subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such 

as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

vacant  properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may acquire multiple vacant properties in close geographic proximity to one another we  may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longerthanassumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs in addition the value of a vacant property could be substantially impaired as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues which may have a material adverse effect on us 

we  rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we make leasing decisions based on our review of rental applications completed by the prospective resident while we may seek to confirm or build on information provided in such rental applications through our own due diligence including by conducting background checks we rely on the information supplied to us by prospective residents to make leasing decisions and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we  depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection and defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than 

if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected in addition most of our potential residents are represented by leasing agents and we may need to pay all or a portion of any related agent commissions which will reduce the revenue from a particular rental home alternatively to the extent that a lease term exceeds one year we may miss out on the ability to raise rents in an appreciating market and be locked into a lower rent until such lease expires 

many factors impact the singlefamily rental market and if rents in our markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations our income and distributable cash could decline 

the success of our business model depends in part on conditions in the singlefamily rental market in our markets our investment strategy is premised on assumptions about occupancy levels rental rates interest rates and other factors and if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate our cash flows and profitability will be reduced recent strengthening of the united states economy and job growth coupled with government programs designed to keep homeowners in their homes andor other factors may contribute to an increase in homeownership rather than renting in addition we expect that as investors like us increasingly seek to capitalize on opportunities to purchase housing assets at below replacement costs and convert them to productive uses the supply of singlefamily rental properties will decrease which may increase competition for residents limit our strategic opportunities and increase the cost to acquire those properties a softening of the rental market in our core areas would reduce our rental revenue and profitability 

we may not have control over timing and costs arising from renovating our properties and the cost of maintaining rental properties is generally higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our costs of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

renters impose additional risks to owning real property renters do not have the same interest as an owner in maintaining a property and its contents and generally do not participate in any appreciation of the property accordingly renters may damage a property and its contents and may not be forthright in reporting damages or amenable to repairing them completely or at all a rental property may need repairs andor improvements after each resident vacates the premises the costs of which may exceed any security deposit provided to us by the resident when the rental property was originally leased accordingly the cost of maintaining rental properties can be higher than the cost of maintaining owneroccupied homes which will affect our costs of operations and may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

declining  real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

we  are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our information systems that support our business processes including marketing leasing vendor communications finance intracompany communications resident portal and property management platforms which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be 

severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses or experienced computer programmers that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position 

our participation in joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and we may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

we currently and may in the future coinvest with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity these joint ventures may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed in addition we may also not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity and our joint venture partners could take actions that are not within our control such actions could among other things impact our ability to maintain our status as a reit further investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our thirdparty partners or coventurers 

we are involved in a variety of litigation 

we are involved in a range of legal actions in the ordinary course of business these actions may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims these actions can be timeconsuming and expensive and may adversely affect our reputation for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we are subject to risks associated with an sec investigation captioned “in the matter of certain single family rental securitizations” 

radian group inc “radian” the indirect parent company of green river capital llc “grc” which is a service provider that provides certain broker price opinions “bpo” to us and previously provided bpos to legacy swh disclosed in its quarterly report on form 10q for the quarterly period ended march 31 2017 that grc had received a letter in march 2017 from the staff of the sec stating that it is conducting an investigation captioned “in the matter of certain single family rental securitizations” and requesting information from market participants radian disclosed that the letter asked grc to provide information regarding bpos that grc provided on properties included in single family rental securitization transactions “securitizations” 

in september 2017 we and legacy swh each received a letter from the staff of the sec stating that it is conducting an investigation captioned “in the matter of certain single family rental securitizations” each letter enclosed a subpoena that requests the production of certain documents and communications related to securitizations by us and legacy swh and their predecessors respectively including without limitation transaction documents and offering materials agreements with providers of bpos andor due diligence services for securitizations identification of employees primarily responsible for handling bpos documents provided to rating agencies or thirdparty bpo providers regarding capital expenditures andor renovation costs for properties underlying securitizations communications with certain transaction parties regarding bpos in securitizations and documents regarding bpo orders and documents and communications with bpo providers regarding requests that a bpo be reviewed redone analyzed modified corrected andor adjusted we have provided documents and communications responsive to the subpoenas to the sec we understand that other transaction parties in securitizations have received requests in this matter 

to the extent that an investigation results in allegations or a determination that we andor legacy swh failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations including without limitation the securities laws and their disclosure requirements this could lead to regulatory enforcement actions or other litigation civil or criminal liability for us the imposition of fines penalties or damages on us impairment of our ability to raise capital and losses on or decreases in market value of our stock and securities issued in securitizations sponsored by us and our predecessors these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition liquidity and results of operations and could also materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments including payments at maturity under the loans relating to our securitizations as the sec’s investigation is ongoing we cannot currently predict the timing outcome or scope of such investigation 

additionally if the sec determines that the bpo values used by us were flawed losses on or a decrease in market value of our stock and securities issued in securitizations sponsored by us and our predecessors could occur bpos are inherently subjective and variances may occur between valuations of a property for a variety of reasons including without limitation bpo providers are not licensed appraisers perform less formal evaluations of properties than full appraisals and do not perform physical inspections or evaluate the condition of the interiors or other factors not easily viewed from outside of the properties differences in the point in time at which an agent examined properties inherent limitations in the methodologies for estimating property values through the use of bpos and differences in the application of methodologies by agents including selection of different comparable sales properties 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots certain environmental hazards and security breaches for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity or wind andor flood risk properties located in active seismic areas include properties throughout california and seattle a number of our properties are also located in texas florida and charlotte which are areas known to be subject to wind andor flood risk while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes and hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances 

environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

we  are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes or floods may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area 

when we have geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe such as an earthquake especially in california or destructive weather event such as a hurricane affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next our financial results may be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather 

eminent  domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we  may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back stock 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the code or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions 

we incurred substantial expenses related to the mergers and will continue to incur substantial expenses in integrating the legacy swh business into our business 

we incurred substantial accounting financial advisory legal and other costs and the management team devoted considerable time and effort in connection with the mergers we will continue to incur significant additional costs in connection with the completion of the mergers in addition to the other costs already incurred 

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the business operations network systems technologies policies and procedures of the two companies the fees and expenses may be significant and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

although we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time as a result the transaction and integration expenses associated with the mergers could particularly in the near term exceed the savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the mergers if the expenses we incur as a result of the mergers are higher than anticipated our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we may be unable to integrate our business and the legacy swh business successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other expected benefits of the mergers on the anticipated timeframe or at all 

the mergers involved the combination of two companies which previously operated as independent public companies we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting a public company platform and the resulting economies of scale these savings are not expected to be fully realized until full integration which is not expected to occur until 2019 we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of ours and legacy swh’s business practices and operations the potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following 

 for all these reasons you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations services standards controls policies and procedures any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with operators vendors and employees to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the mergers 

following the mergers the size of our business is significantly greater than the size of either of the two companies’ businesses prior to the mergers our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated to result from the mergers 

we  may have failed to uncover all liabilities of legacy swh business through the due diligence process prior to the mergers exposing us to potentially large unanticipated costs 

prior to completing the mergers we performed certain due diligence reviews of the legacy swh business in view of timing and other considerations relevant to successfully achieving the closing of the mergers our due diligence reviews were necessarily limited in nature and may not adequately have uncovered all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the mergers any such liabilities could cause us to experience potentially significant losses which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our  cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of the refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms  and 7 the value of the collateral securing our indebtedness may fluctuate and fall below the amount of indebtedness it secures  if a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 97182 million  aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains cross default or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

our access to additional thirdparty sources of financing will depend in part on 

 potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing consequently there is uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure financing on reasonable terms if at all 

secured  indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder andor the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants  in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur additional secured and unsecured debt and otherwise affect our distribution and operating policies  these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default a default under one of our debt agreements could result in a crossdefault under other debt agreements and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable terminate their commitments require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations additionally borrowing base requirements associated with our financing arrangements may prevent us from drawing upon our total maximum capacity under these financing arrangements if sufficient collateral in accordance with our facility agreements is not available 

for example our mortgage loans require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash as the lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes 

we  have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification in order to generate cash for funding new investments mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt 

financings for example accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities and possible changes in accounting rules interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets as well as the debt markets and the economy generally have caused significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgage backed securities as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets including a significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

we   may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible senior notes or to repurchase the convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible senior notes 

holders of the convertible senior notes see definition in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the convertible senior notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any in addition upon conversion of the convertible senior notes unless we elect to deliver solely common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible senior notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible senior notes surrendered therefor or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in addition our ability to repurchase the convertible senior notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the convertible senior notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by future agreements governing our indebtedness the failure to repurchase convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the convertible senior note indentures or to pay any cash due and payable on the convertible senior notes as required by the convertible senior note indentures would constitute a default under the indentures a default under the convertible senior note indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible senior notes or make cash payments thereon 

the   conditional conversion feature of the convertible senior notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in the event the conditional conversion feature of the convertible senior notes is triggered holders of convertible senior notes will be entitled to convert the convertible senior notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their convertible senior notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share of stock we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity 

the   accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material effect on our reported financial results  

under generally accepted accounting principles an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion such as the convertible senior notes in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is recorded as a fair value adjustment to the debt component of the convertible senior notes the adjustment is treated like a discount for accounting purposes and is amortized into interest expense over the term of the convertible senior notes using an effective interest method as a result we will initially be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense because of the amortization of fair value adjustment to the convertible senior notes’ face amount over the term of the convertible senior notes accordingly we will report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period’s amortization of the fair value adjustment and the convertible senior notes’ coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible senior notes 

under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments such as the convertible senior notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method the effect of which is that the stocks issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount under the treasury stock method for diluted earnings per share purposes convertible debt instruments are accounted for as if the number of shares our common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess if we elected to settle such excess in stock are issued however because we have the intent and ability to settle the convertible senior notes in cash the potential shares of common stock contingently issuable up on conversion are excluded from our earnings per share we cannot be certain that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method or that we will continue to maintain the intent and ability to settle the convertible senior notes in cash if either of these scenarios occur our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments totaling 81468 million  as of december 31 2017 bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources ” for more information each 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness would result in a 203 million  change in annual interest expense 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection—in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements—to hedge against the possible negative 

effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

further a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on london interbank offered rate “libor” in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 we are unable to predict the effect of any changes any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor or any replacement of libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere such changes reforms or replacements relating to libor could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any liborlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “—risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items—complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities” 

risks related to our organization and structure 

our sponsor may exercise significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

as of march 22 2018  affiliates of our sponsor beneficially owned approximately 42 of our common stock moreover under our amended stockholders’ agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates so long as our preipo owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 5 of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we will nominate a certain number of individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the “sponsor directors” for election to our board of directors as specified in our stockholders’ agreement and our sponsor must consent to any change to the number of our directors sponsor directors may not be removed without the consent of our sponsor and any change in the number of our directors requires the consent of our sponsor 

although our sponsor and its affiliates do not own shares of our stock representing a majority of our total voting power our sponsor is still able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly our sponsor has significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the election and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the singlefamily rental sector in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders our charter provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition our sponsor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

even though we are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the new york stock exchange “nyse” we may for a limited time continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during such time you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements 

as of november 16 2017 the effective date of the mergers affiliates of our sponsor no longer control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we ceased to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the nyse under these rules a company which ceases to be a “controlled company” has a limited grace period to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirement that within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors 

we have a majority of independent directors on our nominating and corporate governance committee however it is not comprised entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize this exemption until the first anniversary of merger date accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with this annual report on form 10k under the securities act we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act once we are no longer an emerging growth company our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis the process of designing implementing and testing the internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective or if once we are no longer an emerging growth company our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

we  are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of 

 we take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these 

exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our per share trading price may be adversely affected and more volatile 

provisions  of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control 

certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their shares of common stock including 

 we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl and provide that any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl in addition pursuant to a provision in our bylaws we opted out of the control share provisions of the mgcl provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the mgcl or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in each case without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

in addition the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price our charter provides that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we may not elect to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8 including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director 

our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock including preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 

our charter permits our board of directors without any action by our stockholders to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences conversion and other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock which rights may be superior to those of our common stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and 

conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of stock over the then current market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the convertible senior notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

certain provisions in the convertible senior notes and the related indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change holders of the convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes in cash in addition if a takeover constitutes a makewhole fundamental change we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their convertible senior notes in connection with such takeover in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible senior notes and the indentures could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management 

our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval 

our investment financing borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities including growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by our board of directors these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders our charter also provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit in addition our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements a change in these policies or the termination of our reit election could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

our  rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law under current maryland law and our charter our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities in addition we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests 

our  charter contains a provision that expressly permits our sponsor our nonemployee directors and certain of our preipo owners and their affiliates to compete with us 

our sponsor may compete with us for investments in properties and for residents there is no assurance that any conflicts of interest created by such competition will be resolved in our favor moreover our sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and acquires and holds interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates other than to those directors who are employed 

by us or our subsidiaries unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director and none of our sponsor preipo owners or any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law our sponsor and each of our nonemployee directors including those designated by our sponsor and any of their affiliates may 

 our charter also provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law in the event that our sponsor any nonemployee director or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and may take any such opportunity for itself himself or herself or offer it to another person or entity unless the business opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as our director these provisions may limit our ability to pursue business or investment opportunities that we might otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

we are required to disclose in our periodic reports filed with the sec specified activities engaged in by our “affiliates” 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 “itrshra” which expands the scope of united states sanctions against iran more specifically section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving 

iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain office of foreign assets control sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under united states law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the united states president and certain united states congressional committees 

the united states president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we would be required to report if we or any of our “affiliates” knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report because the sec defines the term “affiliate” broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be an affiliate of our sponsor affiliates of our sponsor may also be considered our affiliates affiliates of our sponsor have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activity even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business 

risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items 

if  we do not maintain our qualification as a reit we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability 

we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the code we could fail to meet various compliance requirements which could jeopardize our reit status furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year then 

 reits  in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may become subject to united states federal income taxes and related state and local taxes for example net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a reit a “prohibited transaction” under the code will be subject to a 100 tax we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits similarly if we were to fail an income test and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file united states federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property including income franchise payroll mortgage recording and transfer taxes either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets such as our trss which are subject to full united states federal state local and foreign corporatelevel income taxes any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

complying  with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

in order to qualify as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying  with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more 

than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed 20 25 for any taxable year beginning before january 1 2018 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 

complying  with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a “borrowings hedge” or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income each such hedge a “currency hedge” if clearly identified under applicable united states treasury “treasury” regulations does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit this exclusion from the 95 and 75 gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a borrowings hedge or a currency hedge a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses from hedges held in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs provided however losses in our trs arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 may only be carried forward and may only be deducted against 80 of future taxable income in the trs 

complying  with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 

from time to time our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the code thus we could be required to borrow funds sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative these options could increase our costs or reduce our equity 

even if we qualify to be subject to united states federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that were held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to united states federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the built in gain tax however there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for united states federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares of stock whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares of stock in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares of stock will not have any rights in such excess shares of stock or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status in addition our board of directors granted an exemption from the ownership limit to our sponsor and its affiliates which may limit our board of directors’ power to increase the ownership limit or grant further exemptions in the future 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends 

in connection with our qualification as a reit we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain in order to satisfy this requirement we may make distributions that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock which could account for up to 90 of the aggregate amount of such distributions at the election of each stockholder taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for united states federal income tax purposes as a result united states stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received accordingly united states holders receiving a distribution of our stock may be required to sell stocks received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a united states stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to certain nonunited states holders we may be required to withhold united states tax with respect to such distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the stock included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

no assurance can be given that the  inte rnal revenue service “irs” will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cashstock distributions including on a retroactive basis or assert that the requirements for such taxable cashstock distributions have not been met 

dividends payable by reits do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to certain noncorporate united states stockholders is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 those noncorporate united states stockholders may deduct 20 of their dividends from reits excluding qualified dividend income and capital gains dividends for those united states stockholders in the top marginal tax bracket of 37 the deduction for reit dividends yields an effective income tax rate of 296 on reit dividends which is higher than the 20 tax rate on qualified dividend income paid by c corporations  although the legislation benefits the taxation of reits and dividends payable by reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause certain noncorporate investors to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including our common stock 

we are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth 

as with other reits but unlike corporations generally our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90 of our reit taxable income in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of united states federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock in addition recently enacted tax reform legislation the “tax cuts and jobs act” or “tcja” has resulted in fundamental changes to the code among the numerous changes included in the tcja is a deduction of 20 of ordinary reit dividends for noncorporate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2018 through 2025 the impact of the tcja on an investment in our stock is uncertain we cannot assure you that the tcja or any such other changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of the tcja on your investment in our stock and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

liquidation  of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 

to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory 

our ownership of and relationship with any trs will be restricted and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our reit status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax 

a reit may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more trss a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than 20 and for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 no more than 25 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss the value of our 

interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a trs may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” a trs will pay united states federal state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis 

any trs we own as a domestic corporation will pay united states federal state and local income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us the aggregate value of the trs stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 20 and for taxable years beginning before january 1 2018 25 of the value of our total assets including the trs stock and securities although we plan to monitor our investments in trss there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 20 or 25 as applicable limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above 

recharacterization of leases as financings transactions may negatively affect us 

while we generally intend to use reasonable commercial efforts to structure any lease transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” with us treated as the owner and lessor of the property for federal income tax purposes the irs could challenge such characterization in the event that any lease transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a sellerfinanced conditional sale transaction for federal income tax purposes deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed in addition if we enter such transactions at the reit level in the event of recharacterization the reit could be subject to prohibited transaction taxes finally the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year and require us to pay deficiency dividends interest and penalty taxes in order to maintain reit status 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

we have elected to qualify as a reit for united states  federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets or reduce such distributions if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for united states  federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their stock a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s stock they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by market conditions and by our actual and expected future earnings and level of cash dividends 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of stock without regard to our operating performance for example the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates one of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments as a result if interest rates rise it is possible that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interestbearing securities increase in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our stock could decrease significantly the market value of the equity securities of a reit is also based upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales or refinancings and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of stock to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock

although we currently make quarterly distributions to our stockholders the timing form and amount of distributions if any to our stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds sell assets or reduce such distributions our board of directors reviews the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors including the revenues we receive from our properties our operating expenses interest expense and unanticipated expenditures among others for more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations please see part i item ia “risk factors”

we operate in markets with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential primarily in the western united states florida and the southeastern united states through disciplined market and asset selection we and prior to the mergers swh designed our portfolios to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes   

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior noi growth relative to the broader united states housing and rental market within our 17   markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand drivers such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately   1850   square feet with   three   bedrooms and   two   bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident as of   december 31 2017  we have invested approximately   12 billion   in the upfront renovation of homes in the legacy ih portfolio representing approximately   25000   per home in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are well positioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows

merger with starwood waypoint homes 

on november 16 2017 we completed the mergers with swh we believe that the mergers provide a number of significant potential strategic benefits and opportunities that will be in the best interests of our stockholders more specifically we believe that the mergers created a diversified and highquality portfolio of homes in highgrowth markets potential benefits from economies of scale and the market overlap of invh’s and swh’s complementary portfolios may be derived from optimization of operations reduction of operating costs and other anticipated synergies 

our portfolio 

the following table provides summary information regarding our total portfolio as of and for the periods ended   december 31 2017  as noted below 







factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control see part i item 1a “risk factors” for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals property acquisitions and renovations rental rates and occupancy levels turnover rates and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance and financing arrangements 

market fundamentals   our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 720  of our revenues during the year ended december 31 2017  in recent periods our western united states and florida markets have experienced favorable demand fundamentals with employment growth and household formation rates and favorable supply fundamentals such as the rate of new supply delivery we believe these supply and demand fundamentals have driven favorable rental rate growth and home price appreciation for our western united states and florida markets in recent periods and we expect these trends to continue in the near to intermediate term 

rental rates and occupancy levels  rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years 

turnover rates and days to reresident  other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include increasing the length of stay of our residents minimizing resident turnover rates and reducing the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results also are impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory and economic conditions and outlook increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident increase property operating and maintenance expenses and reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period 

property improvements and maintenance  property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

property acquisitions and renovations  future growth in rental revenues and operating income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property and whether the property was vacant when acquired due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements  financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense mortgage loans term loan facility revolving facility and convertible debt as well as our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized indebtedness to acquire and renovate new homes our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and certain financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms interest rates are impacted by market conditions and the terms of the underlying financing arrangements see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market 

risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations 

recent events 

initial public offering 

on february 6 2017 we completed our ipo in which we sold 88550000 shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of 2000 per share the common stock is listed on the nyse under the symbol invh and began trading publicly on february 1 2017 the offering generated net proceeds of approximately 16921 million to us after underwriting discounts but before transaction costs we used a portion of the net proceeds together with the borrowings under the term loan facility of our new credit facility both described below to repay all of the then existing credit facilities and our mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20131 securitization and a portion of the mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20141 securitization and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering 

in march 2017 we used the remaining ipo proceeds together with cash on hand to voluntarily prepay approximately 2600 million of additional borrowings outstanding under the mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20141 securitization transaction reducing the outstanding principal balance to approximately 4210 million 

merger with starwood waypoint homes   

on november 16 2017 we completed the mergers with swh we believe that the mergers provide a number of significant potential strategic benefits and opportunities that will be in the best interests of our stockholders more specifically we believe that the mergers created a diversified and highquality portfolio of homes in highgrowth markets potential benefits from economies of scale and the market overlap of invh’s and swh’s complementary portfolios may be derived from optimization of operations reduction of operating costs and other anticipated synergies 

the assets including a portfolio of 34670 singlefamily rental homes and liabilities  of swh were recorded at their respective fair values at the merger date the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred was 49205 million  which was based upon i the observable public closing share price of 2301 on november 15 2017 for the 207448958  shares of invh common stock issued to swh stockholders in exchange for their swh common shares ii the equity component of the convertible senior notes which was valued at 1355 million  and iii the recognition of   116 million  of precombination service related to the exchange of swh rsus for invh rsus   

new credit facility 

on february 6 2017 invh lp entered into a new credit agreement with the lenders party thereto bank of america na as administrative agent and the other parties party thereto the new credit agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities together collectively the “new credit facility” consisting of i a 10000 million revolving facility the “revolving facility” which will mature on february 6 2021 with a oneyear extension option subject to certain conditions and ii a 15000 million term loan facility the “term loan facility” which will mature on february 6 2022 see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

fannie mae securitization transaction 

on april 28 2017 we completed a securitization transaction pursuant to which we entered into a loan agreement providing for a new tenyear fixedrate mortgage loan comprised of two components with a total principal amount of 10000 million “ih 20171” ih 20171 will mature june 9 2027 and is secured by first priority mortgages on a portfolio of our homes see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

we used proceeds from the ih 20171 securitization to repay the remaining 4200 million outstanding under our mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20141 securitization transaction to fund certain reserves and to pay transaction fees and expenses incurred with respect to ih 20171 the ih1 20141 mortgage loan outstanding balance had been reduced as of april 28 2017 due to prepayments from ipo proceeds and application of proceeds from sales of homes on may 9 2017 we used the remaining proceeds to voluntarily prepay 5100 million of our mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20143

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  



portfolio information 

as of december 31 2017 and 2016  we owned 82570  and 48298  singlefamily rental homes respectively generating rental revenue of 9949 million  and 8780 million  respectively for the years then ended as of december 31 2017  the legacy ih portfolio accounted for 47917  of the 82570  total owned homes and rental revenues of 9157 million of our total rental revenues of 9949 million  as of december 31 2017  our same store portfolio was comprised of 42689  homes from the legacy ih portfolio 

as a result of the mergers an additional 34670  homes were added to our portfolio which generated rental revenues of 792 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  in addition to the impact of the mergers during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  we acquired 910  and 1253  homes respectively and sold 1308  and 1093  homes respectively 

rental revenues 

in the legacy ih total portfolio rental revenue increased  by 43  due to an increase  in both average occupancy and average monthly rent per occupied home partially offset by a decrease in number of homes owned 

average occupancy for the legacy ih total portfolio was 947  and 945  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively the increase in average occupancy correlates with the decrease in the number of homes acquired during 2017  compared to 2016  as homes are unoccupied for a longer period of time during initial renovations than during a re 

resident period average rent per occupied home for the legacy ih total portfolio in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2017  was 1691  compared to 1611  for the year ended december 31 2016  a 50  increase 

for our same store portfolio our average occupancy was 957  and 961  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively and our average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2017  was 1694  compared to 1626  for the year ended december 31 2016  a 42  increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized concessions leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or new leases where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home the following information regarding our renewal leases and new leases is with respect to the legacy ih total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the legacy ih total portfolio averaged 51  and 55  respectively for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  new lease net effective rental rate growth for the legacy ih total portfolio averaged 36  and 55  respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  the turnover rate for the legacy ih same store portfolio was 346  and 349  respectively for the legacy ih total portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 47  and 42  days between residents for each of the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively 

other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  other property income was 595 million  and 446 million  respectively with the legacy ih portfolio comprising 541 million  of other property income for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase  of 213  the primary drivers of the increase  were pet rent and late fee income attributable to the implementation of our national lease for all leases written beginning in february 2016 and the automation and consistent application of these fees beginning in march 2017 other property income of 54 million  was attributable to the homes acquired in the mergers 

operating expenses 

operating expenses were 9362 million  and 7318 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of operating expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased  to 3915 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 3603 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  due to the increase in the number of homes owned in 2017 the legacy ih portfolio comprised 3605 million  of the property operating and maintenance expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  which is relatively unchanged from 2016 legacy ih portfolio expenses were relatively flat as increases in property taxes for homes owned in both periods were offset by reduced marketlevel personnel expense property operating and maintenance expenses of 310 million  is attributable to homes acquired in the mergers 

property management expense and general and administrative expense increased  to 2111 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 996 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to an increase  in sharebased compensation expense of 710 million  and merger and transactionrelated expenses of   298 million   incurred during the   year ended december 31 2017  

depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to higher average cost basis per home at december 31 2017  compared to december 31 2016  and the addition of 34670 homes acquired in the mergers 

impairment and other expenses increased  to 241 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 42 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to losses and damages related to hurricane irma 

interest expense 

interest expense was 2570 million  and 2860 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively with interest expense related to indebtedness incurred prior to the mergers comprising 2397 million  a decrease  of 162  from the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in average debt balances outstanding during 2017  this was partially offset by an increase in our weighted average cost of debt due to an increase in 

the average monthly libor rates of 63 basis points from 051 to 114 during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2017  respectively the decrease in average debt balances outstanding during the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily attributable to net reductions in debt from the use of a portion of our net ipo proceeds together with the borrowings under the term loan facility to repay all of our then existing credit facilities and certain of our mortgage loans as of december 31 2017  we had 96517 million  of debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts compared to 75703 million  as of december 31 2016  

gain on sale of property net of tax 

gain on sale of property was 339 million  and 186 million  f or the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively an increase  of   823  of the 1308  homes sold during the year ended   december 31 2017  454  were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 95 million  of the 1093  homes sold during the  year ended   december 31 2016  590  homes were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 94 million  the primary driver for the difference in the gain on sale between periods was the composition of homes sold during the respective periods 

year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015 

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 



rental revenues 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we owned 48298 and 48138 singlefamily rental homes respectively generating rental revenue of 8780 million and 8002 million respectively for the years then ended rental revenues increased 97 due to an increase in both average occupancy and average monthly rent per occupied home as well as the increase in number of homes owned during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we acquired 1253 and 3576 homes respectively and sold 1093 and 1481 homes respectively 

average occupancy for the total portfolio was 945 and 934 for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in average occupancy correlates with the decrease in the number of homes acquired during 2016 compared to 2015 as homes are unoccupied for a longer period of time during initial renovations than during a reresident period average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was 1611 compared to 1515 for the year ended december 31 2015 a 63 increase 

for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2014 our average occupancy was 959 and 961 for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively and our average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2016 was 1613 compared to 1545 for the year ended december 31 2015 a 44 increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized concessions leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or a new lease where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home the following information regarding our renewal leases and new leases is with respect to our total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 55 and 51 respectively for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 55 and 43 respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 the turnover rate for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2014 was 352 and 343 respectively for our total portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 42 days between residents for each of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 

other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 other property income was 446 million and 358 million respectively a 244 increase the primary drivers of the increase were utility recoveries and miscellaneous revenues associated with the ongoing implementation of our national lease which standardized resident fees across the portfolio 

operating expenses 

operating expenses were 7318 million and 7217 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively a 14 increase set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of operating expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased to 3603 million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 3480 million for the year ended december 31 2015 due to the increase in the number of homes owned in 2016 and increases in property taxes for homes owned in both periods partially offset by reduced marketlevel personnel expense 

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased to 996 million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 1189 million for the year ended december 31 2015 due to efficiencies from lower headcount a decrease in noncash incentive compensation expense of 177 million and a reduction in severance expense of 52 million these reductions were partially offset by 130 million of expenses incurred in 2016 in preparation for the ipo noncash incentive compensation expense decreased due to an overall reduction in the number of vesting class b units issued by the ih holding entities and in the weighted average fair value per unit of previously issued nonemployee class b units this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of new class b units issued by the ih holding entities during the year  ended   december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  

depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the increase in the number of homes owned and placed into service 

interest expense 

interest expense was 2860 million and 2737 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively a 45 increase the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average monthly libor rates of 30 basis points from 020 to 050 during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2016 respectively and the recognition of 87 million of unrealized losses related to nondesignated interest rate hedges partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred financing costs of 184 million and a reduction in average debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2016 we had 

75703 million of debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts compared to 77260 million as of december 31 2015 a 20 decrease the decrease in debt outstanding was attributable to the payoff of our warehouse loans as well as 2190 million of repayments on our credit facilities credit facility borrowings totaled 1847 million and were utilized to fund acquisitions and improvements 

gain on sale of property 

gain on sale of property was 186 million and 23 million f or the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively  of the 1093  homes sold during the year ended   december 31 2016  590 were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 94 million of the 1481  homes sold during the  year ended   december 31 2015  1314 homes were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 15 million the primary driver for the difference in the gain on sale between periods was the composition of homes sold during the respective periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2017  and 2016  included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1799 million  and 1981 million  respectively a 92   decrease  due primarily to net repayments of certain of our indebtedness which is discussed in further detail in “—cash flows” additionally 9650 million  of the revolving credit facility remained undrawn as of december 31 2017  

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make distributions and dividend payments to our equity investors and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i renovating newlyacquired homes ii funding hoa fees as applicable real estate taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance for our homes iii interest expense and iv payment of dividends to our equity investors our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal payments on our indebtedness 

we intend to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions we believe our rental income net of operating expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and dividend payments on a nearterm basis our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives such as the revolving facility which has an undrawn balance of 9650 million  as of december 31 2017  

as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

the following describes the key terms of our current indebtedness 

mortgage loans 

our securitization transactions the “securitizations” or the “mortgage loans” are collateralized by certain homes owned by the respective borrower entities we utilize the proceeds from our securitizations to fund i repayments of thenoutstanding indebtedness including credit facilities and prior securitization transactions ii initial deposits into securitization reserve accounts iii closing costs in connection with the mortgage loans iv general costs associated with our operations and v distributions and dividends in addition to the securitization transactions we initiated we assumed certain mortgage loans from swh in connection with the mergers   

the following table sets forth a summary of our mortgage loan indebtedness as of   december 31 2017  and 2016  







securitization transactions   

for each securitization transaction the borrower entity executed a loan agreement with a third‑party lender except for ih 20171 each mortgage loan consists of five  to seven  components the components are floating rate except with respect to certain components we were required to retain in connection with risk retention rules the two  to three  year initial terms are individually subject to   two  to five  one year extension options at the borrower entity’s discretion such extensions are available provided there is no continuing event of default under the respective loan agreement and the borrower entity obtains a replacement interest rate cap agreement in a form reasonably acceptable the lender ih 20171 is a 10 year fixed rate mortgage loan comprised of two  components certificates issued by the trust in connection with component a of ih 20171 benefit from the federal national mortgage association’s guaranty of timely payment of principal and interest 

certain components were sold at a discount and 33 million  and 01 million  of unamortized discount are included in mortgage loans net in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

each mortgage loan is secured by a pledge of the equity in the assets of the respective borrower entities as well as firstpriority mortgages on the underlying properties and a grant of security interests in all of the related personal property as of   december 31 2017 and 2016  a total of 47616  and 30900  homes unaudited respectively were pledged pursuant to the mortgage loans we are obligated to make monthly payments of interest for each mortgage loan and ih 20131 and cah 20141 also required monthly payments of principal 

transactions with trusts   

concurrent with the execution of each loan agreement the respective thirdparty lender sold each loan it originated to individual depositor entities the “depositor entities” who subsequently transferred each loan to securitizationspecific trust entities the “trusts” the depositor entities are whollyowned subsidiaries except for the ih 20131 and ih 20141 depositor entities which were whollyowned by unaffiliated third parties   

as consideration for the transfer of each loan to the trusts the trusts issued certificate classes which mirror the components of the individual loan agreements collectively the “certificates” to the depositor entities except that class r certificates do not have related loan components as they represent residual interests in the trusts the certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trusts following receipt of the certificates the depositor entities sold the certificates to investors using the proceeds as consideration for the loans sold to the depositor entities by the lenders these transactions had no effect on our consolidated financial statements other than with respect to certificates we retained in connection with a securitization or purchased at a later date   

the trusts are structured as passthrough entities that receive interest and in the case of ih1 20131 and cah 20141 principal payments from the securitizations and distribute those payments to the holders of the certificates the assets held by the trusts are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of those entities the obligations of the trusts do not have any recourse to the general credit of any entities in these consolidated financial statements we have evaluated our interests in certain certificates of the trusts held by us discussed below and determined that they do not create a more than insignificant variable interest in the trusts additionally the retained certificates do not provide us with any ability to direct the activities that could impact the trusts’ economic performance therefore we do not consolidate the trusts 

retained certificates   

beginning in april 2014  the trusts made certificates available for sale to both domestic and foreign investors with the introduction of foreign investment sponsors of the mortgage loans are required to retain a portion of the risk that represents a material net economic interest in each loan these requirements were further refined in december 2016 pursuant to regulation rr the “risk retention rules” under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as such loan sponsors are now required to retain a portion of the credit risk that represents not less than 5  of the aggregate fair value of the loan as of the closing date 

to fulfill these requirements class g certificates for ih1 20142 ih1 20143 ih2 20151 ih2 20152 ih2 20153 cah 20151 csh 20161 and csh 20162 are equal to 5  of the original principal amount of the loans per the terms of the mortgage loan agreements the class g certificates are restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to the sponsor as applicable we retained these class g certificates at the time of the related securitizations and they are principal 

only bearing a stated interest rate of 00005  additionally in certain instances we have elected to purchase certain class f certificates which bear a stated annual interest rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 480  to 508  

for ih 20171 the class b certificates are restricted certificates that were made available exclusively to invh lp in order to comply with the risk retention rules the class b certificates bear a stated annual interest rate of 423  including applicable servicing fees 

for ih 20172 and swh 20171 we retained a portion of each certificate class to meet the risk retention rules these retained certificates accrue interest at a floating rate of libor plus a spread ranging from 091  to 347  

the retained certificates total 3785 million  and 2093 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively are classified as held to maturity investments and are recorded in other assets net in the consolidated balance sheets  

loan covenants 

the general terms that apply to all of the mortgage loans require us to maintain compliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants affirmative covenants with which we must comply include our and certain of our affiliates’ compliance with i licensing permitting and legal requirements specified in the loan agreement ii organizational requirements of the jurisdictions in which we and certain of our affiliates are organized iii federal and state tax laws and iv books and records requirements specified in the respective loan agreements negative covenants with which we must comply include our and certain of our affiliates’ compliance with limitations surrounding i the amount of our indebtedness and the nature of our investments ii the execution of transactions with affiliates iii the manager and iv the nature of our business activities at december 31 2017  and through the date our consolidated financial statements were issued we believe we were in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants   

prepayments   

for the mortgage loans prepayments of amounts owed are generally not permitted by us under the terms of the respective loan agreements unless such prepayments are made pursuant to the voluntary election and mandatory provisions specified in such agreements the specified mandatory provisions become effective to the extent that a property becomes characterized as a disqualified property a property is sold andor upon the occurrence of a condemnation or casualty event associated with a property to the extent either a voluntary election is made or a mandatory prepayment condition exists in addition to paying all interest and principal we must also pay certain breakage costs as determined by the loan servicer and a spread maintenance premium if prepayment occurs before the month following the one or two year anniversary of the closing dates of each of the mortgage loans except for ih 20171 for ih 20171 prepayments on or before december 2026 will require a yield maintenance premium for the years ended   december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  we made voluntary and mandatory prepayments of   29510 million    421 million  and   132 million  respectively under the terms of the loan agreements 

term loan facility and revolving facility 

on february 6 2017 we entered into the new credit facility which was amended on december 18 2017 to include entities and homes acquired in the mergers the new credit facility provides 25000 million  of borrowing capacity and consists of the 10000 million  revolving facility which will mature on february 6 2021 with a one year extension option and the 15000 million  term loan facility which will mature on february 6 2022 the revolving facility also includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings in each case subject to certain sublimits the new credit facility provides us with the option to enter into additional incremental credit facilities including an uncommitted incremental facility that provides us with the option to increase the size of the revolving facility andor the term loan facility by an aggregate amount of up to   15000 million   subject to certain limitations proceeds from the term loan facility were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes proceeds from the revolving facility were used for general corporate purposes

 interest rate and fees 

borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a libor rate determined by reference to the bloomberg libor rate or comparable or successor rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or b a base rate determined by reference to the highest of 1 the administrative agent’s prime lending rate 2 the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3 the libor rate that would be payable on such day for a libor rate loan with a onemonth interest period plus   100  the margin is based on a total leverage based grid the margin for the revolving facility ranges from   075  to 130  in the case of base rate loans and   175  to 230  in the case of libor rate loans the margin for the term loan facility ranges from 070   to 130  in the case of base rate loans and 170  to   230  in the case of libor rate loans in addition the new credit facility provides that upon receiving an investment grade rating on its noncredit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt of bbb or better from standard  poor’s rating services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc or baa3 or better from moody’s investors service inc an “investment grade rating event” we may elect to convert to a credit rating based pricing grid 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the new credit facility we are required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving facility in respect of the unused commitments thereunder the facility fee rate is based on the daily unused amount of the revolving facility and is either   035  or 020   per annum based on the unused facility amount upon converting to a credit rating pricing based grid the unused facility fee will no longer apply and we will be required to pay a facility fee ranging from 0125  to 0300  we are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees 

prepayments and amortization 

no  principal reductions are required under the new credit facility we are permitted to voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the term loan facility at any time without premium or penalty subject to certain minimum amounts and the payment of customary “breakage” costs with respect to libor loans once repaid no   further borrowings will be permitted under the term loan facility

certain hedging arrangements 

from time to time we enter into derivative instruments to manage the economic risk of changes in interest rates we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and for which we have elected to designate them as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or which we did not elect to designate as accounting hedges 

designated hedges 

we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements which are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variablerate interest payments certain of the invitation homes partnerships and certain borrower entities guaranteed the obligations under each of the interest rate swaps from the date the swaps were entered into through the date of the ipo 

each of these swaps was accounted for as a nondesignated hedge until january 31 2017 when the criteria for hedge accounting were met as a result of the preipo transactions described in  part i item 1 “business—preipo transactions and mergers” at that time we designated these swaps for hedge accounting purposes subsequent to that date changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 

in addition in connection with the mergers we acquired various interest rate swap instruments which we designated for hedge accounting purposes we recorded these interest rate swaps at their aggregate estimated fair value of 211 million  over the terms of each swap an amount equal to the merger date fair value will be amortized and recorded as an increase in interest expense and accumulated other comprehensive income 

the table below summarizes our interest rate swap instruments as of   december 31 2017   in thousands 



during the year ended   december 31 2017  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variablerate interest payments amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variablerate debt during the next 12 months we estimate that   53 million  will be reclassified to earnings as a decrease in interest expense 

there were   no   interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges outstanding during the year ended december 31 2016   

nondesignated hedges 

concurrent with entering into certain of the mortgage loan agreements and in connection with the mergers we entered into or acquired and maintain interest rate cap agreements with terms and notional amounts equivalent to the terms and amounts of the loans made by the thirdparty lenders and strike prices ranging from approximately   263  to 443   collectively the “strike prices” to the extent that the maturity date of one or more of the mortgage loans is extended through an exercise of one or more of the extension options replacement or extension interest rate cap agreements must be executed with terms similar to those associated with the initial interest rate cap agreements and strike prices equal to the greater of the strike prices and the interest rate at which the debt service coverage ratio as defined is not less than   12  to 10  

the interest rate cap agreements including all of our rights to payments owed by the counterparty and all other rights have been pledged as additional collateral for the loans   

purchase of outstanding debt securities or loans 

as market conditions warrant we and our equity investors including our sponsor its affiliates and members of our management may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans or debt securities that we may issue in the future in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt including borrowings under our credit facilities and mortgage loans the amounts involved in any such purchase transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series in addition any such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” as defined for united states federal income tax purposes may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us which amounts may be material and in related adverse tax consequences to us 

cash flows 

year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016   

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  



operating activities 

our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our homes the rental rates achieved on our leases the collection of rent from our residents and the amount of our operating and other expenses net cash provided by operating activities  was 2598 million  and 2501 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively an increase  of 39  cash provided by operating activities included cash from operations of 2920 million  and 2564 million  and 322 million  and 63 million  from other changes in operating assets and liabilities for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase  in cash from operations was primarily attributable to an increase of 1007 million in net operating income partially offset by 251 million of incremental ipo and merger and transactionrelated expenses compared to 2016 and 215 million of hurricane related damages recorded in 2017 

investing activities

december 31 2017  which resulted in 574 million   less  in acquisition renovation and capital expenditure spend the increase  in number of homes sold during 2017  of 1308  compared to 1093  homes during the year ended december 31 2016  resulted in an increase  in the amount of proceeds from sale of residential properties of 629 million  the changes above were partially offset by an increase in investments in debt securities of 791 million  resulting from the application of risk retention rules to our ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities  was 3313 million  and 718 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively or a decrease  in cash of 2595 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  we received 16921 million  in proceeds net of underwriting discounts from our ipo while during the year ended december 31 2016  equity investors contributed 1380 million  of capital 

during the year ended december 31 2017  proceeds from our ipo term loan facility revolving facility and the ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans of 51885 million  along with proceeds from home sales and operating cash flows were used to repay 23216 million  of thenoutstanding credit facilities and 29510 million  of mortgage loans including full repayment of the ih1 20131 ih1 20141 and ih1 20143 mortgage loans to fund 546 million  of deferred financing costs associated with the term loan facility and the ih 20171 and ih 20172 mortgage loans and for dividend payments which totaled 690 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  proceeds from our equity investors and credit facilities of 3227 million  along with proceeds from operating cash flows were used to repay 3811 million  of debt 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016  and the year ended december 31 2015  



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2501 million and 1975 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively an increase of 267 the increase was primarily driven by our net loss decreasing from 1602 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 782 million for the year ended december 31 2016 partially offset by a 374 million decrease in noncash expenses our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our homes the rental rates achieved on our leases the collection of rent from our residents and the amount of our operating and other expenses 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of the acquisition costs of homes capital improvements changes in restricted cash and proceeds from property sales net cash used in investing activities was 2550 million and 8598 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively a decrease in use of cash of 703 the decrease in use of funds was primarily due to i a decrease in homes acquired during 2016 from 3576 homes during the year ended december 31 2015 to 1253 homes during the year ended december 31 2016 and by ii a decrease in purchases of investments in debt securities from 1186 million during the year ended december 31 2015 to 160 million during the year ended december 31 2016

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  consisted of the following 





 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recentlyissued and adopted accounting standards see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” note 2 

as an emerging growth company we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under section 102b of the jobs act 

investments in singlefamily residential properties   

upon acquisition we evaluate our acquired singlefamily residential properties for purposes of determining whether a transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination upon adoption of asu 201701 business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business  “asu 201701” our purchases of homes are treated as asset acquisitions and are recorded at their purchase price which is allocated between land building and improvements and inplace lease intangibles when a tenant is in place at the acquisition date based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition the purchase price for purposes of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees bidding service and title fees payments made to cure tax utility homeowners’ association “hoa” and other mechanic’s and miscellaneous liens as well as other closing costs properties acquired in the mergers were recorded at fair value  the fair values of acquired inplace lease intangibles if any are based on the costs to execute similar leases including commissions and other related costs the origination value of inplace lease intangibles also includes an estimate of lost rent revenue at inplace rental rates during the estimated time required to lease the property the inplace lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the leases and are recorded in other assets net in our consolidated balance sheets  prior to our adoption of asu 201701 effective january 1 2017 acquisition costs for transactions accounted for as business combinations were expensed in the period in which they were incurred and were reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

cost capitalization   

we incur costs to acquire stabilize and prepare our singlefamily residential properties to be rented we capitalize these costs as a component of our investment in each singlefamily residential property using specific identification and relative allocation methodologies including renovation costs and other costs associated with activities that are directly related to preparing our properties for use as rental real estate other costs include interest costs property taxes property insurance utilities hoa fees  when applicable and the salaries and benefits of the manager’s employees who are directly responsible for the execution of our stabilization activities the capitalization period associated with our stabilization activities begins at such time that activities commence and concludes at the time that a singlefamily residential property is available to be leased   

once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions the determination of which costs to capitalize requires significant judgment accordingly many factors are considered as part of our evaluation processes with no one factor necessarily determinative   

depreciation 

costs capitalized in connection with singlefamily residential property acquisitions stabilization activities and on an ongoing basis are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis the depreciation period commences upon the cessation of stabilization related activities or upon the completion of improvements made on an ongoing basis for those costs capitalized in connection with residential property acquisitions and stabilization activities and those capitalized on an ongoing basis the weighted average useful lives range from 7 years  to 285 years  

provisions for impairment   

we continuously evaluate by property whether there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our singlefamily residential properties may not be recoverable examples of such events and changes in circumstances that we consider include significant and persistent declines in an individual property’s net operating income regional changes in home price appreciation as measured by certain independently developed indices change in expected use of the property significant adverse legal factors substantive damage to the individual property as a result of natural disasters and other risks inherent in our business not covered by insurance proceeds or a current expectation that a property will be disposed of prior to the end of its estimated useful life   

to the extent an event or change in circumstance is identified a residential property is considered to be impaired only if its carrying value cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property cash flow projections are prepared using internal analyses based on current rental renewal and occupancy rates operating expenses and inputs from our annual planning process that give consideration to each property’s historical results current operating trends and current market conditions to the extent an impairment has occurred the carrying amount of our investment in a property is adjusted to its estimated fair value to determine the estimated fair value we consider local broker price opinions “bpos” and automated valuation model “avm” data each of which are important components of our process with no one information source being necessarily determinative in order to validate the bpos and avm data received and used in our assessment of fair value of real estate we perform an internal review to determine if an acceptable valuation approach was used to estimate fair value in compliance with guidance provided by asc 820 fair value measurements  additionally we undertake an internal review to assess the relevance and appropriateness of comparable transactions that have been used and any adjustments to comparable transactions made in reaching the value opinions   

the process whereby we assess our singlefamily residential properties for impairment requires significant judgment and assessment of factors that are at times subject to significant uncertainty we evaluate multiple information sources and perform a number of internal analyses each of which are important components of our process with no one information source or analysis being necessarily determinative   

derivatives 

we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements collectively “hedging derivatives” for interest rate risk management purposes we do not enter into hedging derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes and all of our hedging derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets designated hedges are derivatives that meet the criteria for hedge accounting and that we have elected to designate as hedges nondesignated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or that we have not elected to designate as hedges 

pursuant to the terms of certain of our mortgage loans we are required to maintain interest rate caps we have elected not to designate these interest cap agreements for hedge accounting collectively the “nondesignated hedges” we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk arising from changes in our interest payments on variablerate debt due to changes in the onemonth  libor  in connection with the preipo transactions and the mergers we have elected to account for our interest rate swap agreements as effective cash flow hedges collectively the “designated hedges” we assess the effectiveness of these interest rate swap cash flow hedging relationships on an ongoing basis the effect of these interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements is to reduce the variability of interest payments due to changes in libor 

the fair value of hedging derivatives that are in an asset position are included in other assets net and those in a liability position are included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for nondesignated hedges the related changes in fair value are reflected within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations for designated hedges the changes in fair value are reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets and reclassified into earnings as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations when the hedged transactions affect earnings 

revenue recognition and resident receivables   

rental revenue net of any concessions is recognized monthly as it is earned on a straightline basis over the term of the lease other property income is recognized when earned and realized or realizable   

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of residents to make required rent or other payments this allowance is estimated based on among other considerations payment histories and overall delinquencies the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a reduction of rental revenues and other property income in our consolidated statements of operations 

sharebased compensation expense 

prior to the ipo we recognized sharebased compensation expense for incentive compensation units granted by the invitation homes partnerships the “class b units” in connection with and subsequent to the ipo we issued rsus  that 

settle in shares of common stock and  restricted shares of our common stock “rsas” for which sharebased compensation expense is recognized   

we recognized sharebased compensation expense for the class b units based on the estimated fair value of the class b units and vesting conditions of the related incentive unit agreements since the class b units granted by ih1 were granted to employees of the manager a whollyowned subsidiary of ih1 the related sharebased compensation expense was based on the grantdate fair value of the units and recognized in expense over the service period because units in ih2 ih3 ih4 ih5 and ih6 were granted to nonemployees of those respective partnerships fair value was remeasured for nonvested units at the end of each reporting period the fair value of the class b units was determined based on a valuation model that took into account discounted cash flows and a market approach based on comparable companies and transactions 

we recognize sharebased compensation expense for the rsus and rsas based on their grantdate fair value net of expected forfeitures over the service period from the grant date to vest date for each tranche or when any applicable performance or market conditions are met in accordance with the related rsu and rsa agreements the grantdate fair value of rsus and rsas is generally based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date except for market based rsu grant‑date fair values which are based on montecarlo option pricing models 

additional compensation expense is recognized if modifications to existing incentive compensation unit rsu or rsa agreements result in an increase in the postmodification fair value of the units that exceeds their premodification fair value sharebased compensation expense is presented as components of general and administrative expense and property management expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

segment reporting   

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker “codm” in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer   

under the provision of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties including singlefamily homes in planned unit developments the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes net operating income as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level 

nongaap measures 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” before the following items interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda before the following items sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance impairment and other acquisition costs gain loss on sale of property net of tax and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income or loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the ebitda and adjusted ebitda of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda as determined in accordance with gaap on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated 





 net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses repairs and maintenance leasing costs and marketing noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization general and administrative expense property management expense impairment and other acquisition costs gain loss on sale of property net of tax and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure 

of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio as determined in accordance with gaap on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated 





 funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments gains 

or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes as well noncontrolling interests from gaap net income or loss by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in homes however ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs loan discounts noncash interest expense for derivatives sharebased compensation expense ipo related expenses merger and transactionrelated expenses severance expense casualty losses net and acquisition costs as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that we may borrow under the new credit facility in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2017  our outstanding variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 66118 million  revolving facility of 350 million  and term loan facility of 15000 million  of which 751  was effectively converted to fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements additionally all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt the projected effect of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in libor on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase or decrease of 203 million  this estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements interest rate cap agreements and any libor floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

we have selected locations with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rentgrowth potential primarily in the western united states and florida through disciplined market and asset selection we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes 

we invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply stronger job and household formation growth and superior noi growth relative to the broader us housing and rental market within our 13  markets we target attractive neighborhoods in infill locations with multiple demand generators such as proximity to major employment centers desirable schools and transportation corridors our homes average approximately 1850  square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we have made approximately 12 billion  of upfront renovation investment in the homes in our portfolio representing approximately 25000  per home in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are well positioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable cash flows 

our platform 

our vertically integrated scalable platform allows greater influence over the experience of our residents while enabling us to better control operating costs and continuously share best practices across functional areas of the business our differentiated platform is built upon 

 our approach to investment and asset management similarly combines local presence and expertise with national oversight our investment and asset management teams are located inmarket and apply their local market knowledge within 

the framework of a proprietary and consistent underwriting methodology through the integration of investment and asset management and property management functions our platform enables our teams to incorporate real time information regarding leasing activity property operations maintenance and capital spending into asset selection we believe the advantages of our integrated acquisition platform and local market expertise have driven the quality of our existing portfolio of 48298  homes as of december 31 2016  over 94  of which were acquired in singleasset transactions we believe that employing experienced inhouse acquisitions teams at the local level gives us a competitive advantage in selectively acquiring homes that will maximize riskadjusted total return 

our business activities 

since our founding in 2012 we have built a proven vertically integrated operating platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire renovate lease maintain and manage our homes our differentiated approach which combines a residentcentric focus local market presence and expertise and national strategy infrastructure and standards informs all areas of our operations 

investment and asset management 

acquisition strategy 

we have a disciplined acquisition platform that assembled our current portfolio and is capable of deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and markets simultaneously we selected our 13   current markets based on a robust market selection process utilizing an analysis of housing and rental market supply and demand fundamentals macroeconomic and demographic trends and riskadjusted total return potential specifically the process we use to select our markets ranks these markets based on relative weightings of factors that include but are not limited to forecast population and employment growth household formation historical and forecast deliveries of new residential housing supply discounts to replacement cost for singlefamily residential housing size of the addressable market volume of new and existing home sales potential yields implied by the relationship between market rental rates and the price of singlefamily residential housing forecast home price appreciation and forecast rental rate growth 

we have amassed significant scale within our 13  markets in these markets our acquisition strategy has been and will continue to be focused on buying renovating and operating high quality singlefamily homes for lease that we believe will appeal to and attract a high quality resident base experience robust longterm demand and benefit from capital appreciation in evaluating acquisitions we analyze 64 factors including neighborhood desirability proximity to employment centers schools transportation corridors community amenities construction type and required ongoing capital needs among others 

we target submarkets and neighborhoods in undersupplied highgrowth markets and leverage our inhouse acquisition and operations teams’ local market expertise to acquire homes in infill locations that we believe will experience above average rental rate growth and home price appreciation our inhouse acquisition teams comprise dedicated professionals located in our 13  markets and professionals located at our corporate headquarters in dallas texas who provide strategic direction and overall oversight our acquisition teams have significant local market experience and expertise in singlefamily investments and sales which enables us to target specific submarkets neighborhoods individual streets and homes that meet our selection and underwriting criteria to date we have underwritten over one million individual homes which gives us a substantial proprietary database on which we can draw as we evaluate future acquisition opportunities in our markets the number of homes underwritten represents the total number of acquisition opportunities that we have considered and conducted preliminary analysis of including acquisition opportunities that were ultimately not pursued or completed as a result of our selective and disciplined investment approach we have analyzed and considered a far greater number of potential acquisitions than the number of homes we have actually acquired as a result of our large existing portfolio and volume of acquisitions to date we believe we have a high degree of visibility into rental rates and fixed and controllable operating expenses which allows us to more accurately underwrite expected net yields of homes prior to acquisition we also collaborate with local real estate brokers and others and leverage these relationships to source offmarket acquisition opportunities within our markets our approach allows us to screen broadly and rapidly to identify potential acquisitions in highly targeted submarkets at the neighborhood and street levels our inhouse team of acquisition professionals coordinate with our inhouse renovation maintenance and property management teams to ensure that feedback from historical 

acquisitions is shared across functions so that our ongoing investment activities are informed by and benefit from insight from prior experience 

property renovations 

we have an inhouse team of dedicated personnel located in our markets who oversee our upfront property renovation process and the ongoing maintenance of our homes this team works in collaboration with our inhouse investment and property management teams to maximize the total return of our upfront investment and minimize ongoing maintenance costs to this end our professionals evaluate the structural needs of a property eg examining roofs hvac systems and siding other maintenancereducing improvements and repairs eg installing durable hardsurface flooring removing carpet from hightraffic areas and testing plumbing and pipes both in the home and out to the street and the level of fit and finish required to maintain consistency with our brand standards and maximize rental demand eg selecting cabinet and countertop finishes and appliances designed to improve resident demand 

in general before a home is acquired or when an acquired home first becomes vacant our inhouse teams begin the renovation process by preparing a detailed renovation budget and scope of work based on an assessment of each property’s major systems and structural features these include hvac roofs pools and plumbing and electrical systems in addition we also evaluate other features of our homes’ fit and finish including appliances landscaping decks andor patios and fixtures during our initial assessment we also determine the potential for and potential return on any valueadditive upgrades that may reduce future operating costs or enhance rental demand and by extension our ability to realize more attractive rental rates occupancy or turnover rates 

through local oversight by inhouse personnel of the entire process of renovating our homes we are able to drive cost efficiencies each property’s detailed budget and scope of work prepared by our inhouse team of renovation professionals is reviewed and vetted by our inhouse asset management and operations teams and in the case of work we contract directly presented for bid to one or more of our preapproved vendor partners in each of our markets in the case of work for which we rely upon general contractors we set prices based on the scope of work involved by establishing and enforcing best practices and quality consistency and through a constant process of evaluating and grading our vendor partners we believe that we are able to reduce the costs of both materials and labor for example we have negotiated discounts and extended warranties for products that we regularly use during the renovation process including appliances hvac systems and components carpet and flooring and paint among others we are also able to reduce general contractor fees by working directly with vendors we believe this approach results in both a larger proportion of our upfront renovation expenditures going toward actual investment in our homes as well as lower overall expenditures than if we were to outsource all elements of vendor selection and oversight to third party general contractors 

portfolio optimization 

we maintain a sophisticated process to identify and efficiently dispose of homes that no longer fit our investment objectives we believe we have a proven ability to optimize sales prices while reducing time to sale and selling costs by utilizing multiple distribution channels including bulk portfolio sales our new “resident first look” program which facilitates home sales to our current residents directtomarket sales and mls we believe the significant local density of our portfolio which averages over 3715  homes per market as of december 31 2016  allows us to selectively sell properties without sacrificing the operating efficiency of our concentrated scale 

property operations 

property operations encompasses the inhouse local market management and execution of marketing leasing resident relations and maintenance functions we have developed and employ a highly scalable vertically integrated residentcentric property management platform all of our property management functions have been internally managed since our founding in 2012 and we have developed an extensive property management infrastructure including systems dedicated inmarket personnel and local offices in each of our markets all of our local market personnel are supported by our centralized national infrastructure which allows us to deploy best practices and standardization where appropriate the combination of our local market presence and national infrastructure enables us to exercise greater control over our property management platform allowing us to enhance the experience of our residents better manage operating costs and share best practices across various functional areas of our business 

we have organized our inhouse property management personnel and operating structure according to a “community model” whereby vice presidents of operations in each of our markets are responsible for the operations of local leasing management property management and maintenance teams we believe our “community model” differentiates our approach to local market operations and enables us to provide superior hightouch resident service maximize the effectiveness of our inmarket personnel in managing rental rates occupancy and turnover rates and improve our cost management and oversight over both upfront renovations and ongoing maintenance 

marketing and leasing 

our inhouse personnel are responsible for establishing rental rates marketing and leasing properties and collecting and processing rent we establish rental rates based on a dynamic rulesbased pricing tool that is informed by local market conditions including a competitive analysis of market rents for institutional singlefamily rental properties growth in singlefamily and multifamily market rents since a specific home’s last lease commenced the size fit and finish and location of the home the number of applications received andor showings a property has experienced since becoming available and the number of days a home has been available on the market as well as qualitative factors such as neighborhood characteristics community amenities and proximity to employment centers desirable schools transportation corridors and local services 

we typically begin premarketing properties 30 to 60 days in advance of their becoming vacant to maintain high occupancy rates and reduce vacancy losses we advertise available properties through multiple channels including our website rentcafé internet listing services such as zillow trulia and hotpads syndicated through rentcafé mls yard signs social media and local brokers we own internal brokerages to serve each state in which we operate and utilize leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes in some markets we also utilize a network of local real estate agents to show homes to prospective residents and offer those agents limited cobroker fees 

prospective residents may submit an application through our website the rentcafé platform or in person in order to maintain brand consistency and better track compliance with leasing requirements we utilize a standardized online application national lease agreement movein and moveout documents resident communications and other ancillary documents we evaluate prospective residents in a standardized manner through the use of a third party resident screening vendor partner our resident screening process includes obtaining appropriate identification a thorough evaluation of credit history and household income a review of the applicant’s rental history and a background check for criminal activity although we require a minimum income to rent ratio many additional factors are also taken into consideration during the resident evaluation process including eviction history criminal history and rental and other payment history 

our disciplined investment strategy and local inmarket approach have given us scale and density of homes in desirable neighborhoods enabling us to execute demographic and geotargeted digital advertising we believe this will increase our likelihood of capturing and retaining qualified residents whose lifestyle and purchasing power enhance our opportunity to develop and market other programs and services 

digital marketing initiatives and branding 

we encourage meaningful community interaction across our digital platforms by continuously refreshing the content of our website blog and social media accounts with articles home maintenance advice contests and incentives designed to enrich the lives of our residents and protect our homes for example we alert our residents to prepare for storms incentivize them to pay their rent online and encourage them to submit photos of their family events and pets 

resident relations and property maintenance 

our inhouse personnel in each of our markets are also responsible for property repairs and maintenance and resident relations we offer a 247 emergency line to handle after hours maintenance issues on an expedited basis as needed and our residents can also contact us through our online resident portal our call centers or our local property management office as part of our ongoing property management process we seek to conduct routine repairs and maintenance in a timely manner as appropriate by appointment at the resident’s convenience we seek to utilize quality materials to minimize the recurrence of maintenance requests and maximize longterm rental income and cash flows from our portfolio 

we typically utilize our inhouse maintenance personnel in each of our markets to provide ordinary course “handyman” services and outsource more complex or extensive repairs such as roofing hvac and plumbing and electrical work to vetted preapproved third party vendor partners a majority of our maintenance calls are addressed by our inhouse 

maintenance technicians but in cases where we outsource more complex or extensive repairs our inhouse maintenance personnel provide oversight to ensure quality control and cost effectiveness in addition our inhouse property management personnel conduct periodic visits to our properties to help foster positive longterm relationships with our residents track and report maintenance needs effectively conduct preventative maintenance and ensure compliance with lease terms local laws and hoa rules and regulations 

we have developed a number of policies and programs designed to improve the efficiency of our property maintenance practices and maximize resident satisfaction with our service model when a new resident moves into one of our homes our inhouse personnel conduct a resident orientation during which we revisit the terms of the lease outline what aspects of the home’s upkeep are the resident’s responsibility walk through all of the home’s major systems in order to familiarize the resident with their safe and proper operation and inform the resident that we will be conducting a 45day post movein maintenance visit during the movein orientation each resident is provided with a “refrigerator list” and encouraged to keep a record of any nonemergency service items noted after moving into the home at the time of the 45day post movein maintenance visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel will address any service needs the resident has noted we believe this process has a number of benefits first by conducting an inperson movein orientation we are able to ensure that residents understand their obligations under the terms of their lease as well as how to safely and properly operate the home’s systems reducing both the likelihood of misaligned expectations and unnecessary wear and tear on the property second by scheduling a 45day post movein maintenance visit we are able to address multiple service requests in a single visit improving the resident experience by avoiding the inconvenience of multiple service appointments and improving the efficiency and productivity of our inhouse property maintenance personnel finally the 45day post movein maintenance visit allows us to more quickly identify residents who may not be adhering to the terms of their lease or may be subjecting the home to undue wear and tear andor damages as a result of their treatment of the property 

following the regularly scheduled 45day post movein maintenance visit described above our inhouse property maintenance personnel in each of our markets also conduct preventative maintenance visits which are scheduled approximately every six months during preventative maintenance visits our inhouse property maintenance personnel inspect the home’s systems paying particular attention to potential safety hazards as well as potential causes of damage that could cause us to incur significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed examples of areas of focus for preventative maintenance visits include smoke and radon detectors air filters hot water heaters toilet valves undersink plumbing and garbage disposals among others 

we also conduct pre moveout inspections 15 to 30 days prior to scheduled resident moveouts these inspections allow us to notify residents of any repairs they may need to undertake prior to moving out of the property such as carpet cleaning or landscaping maintenance in order to avoid forfeiture of part or all of their security deposit in addition these inspections allow our inhouse property maintenance personnel to begin preparing a scope of work and budget for the turnover work we undertake between residents to prepare our homes to be released to a new resident these inspections also increase our ability to premarket our homes 

regardless of the purpose or timing of the visit our inhouse property maintenance personnel are required to conduct a general property condition assessment “gpca” every time they visit one of our homes the gpca requires our inhouse property maintenance personnel to assess and document interior and exterior condition whether the resident is adhering to the terms of their lease as well as any potential safety hazards or potential causes of damage that could cause us to incur significant maintenance costs if left unaddressed 

corporate responsibility 

our mission statement is “together with you we make a house a home” we recognize that the vitality of our business is directly linked to the vitality of the communities in which we operate to date we have invested over 12 billion  in the upfront renovation of our properties or an average of 25000  per home we believe that the investments we make and the high standards to which we renovate and maintain our homes benefit our communities creating jobs and improving the overall quality of life for our residents and their neighbors we believe such investments improve our relationships with local communities and hoas and enhance our brand recognition and loyalty by offering quality homes in attractive neighborhoods we believe we give residents the choice to rent a home in a community that may not have otherwise been attainable 

we believe in doing business with a purpose since our beginning we have operated to benefit our residents our employees and our communities by deeply embedding our values ethics and integrity into all that we do the way we think act partner and execute is guided by our values our code of business conduct and ethics is posted on our corporate website and explains how we integrate our purpose mission and values into our daily decisions it demonstrates our commitment to our stakeholders to be a responsible corporate citizen and a good business partner 

we support social and environmental initiatives particularly in our operations and communities we strive to manage and minimize negative impacts throughout the value chain where possible and work on developing sustainable business practices through our organization we believe that we can respond to local and global environmental challenges by combining our strengths in sustainability innovation and partnership 

preipo transactions 

on january 31 2017 we and our preipo owners effected certain transactions the “preipo transactions” that resulted in the operating partnership holding directly or indirectly all of the assets liabilities and results of operations reflected in our combined and consolidated financial statements including the full portfolio of homes held by the ih holding entities as a result of the preipo transactions the operating partnership is wholly owned by invitation homes inc directly and through its wholly owned subsidiary invitation homes op gp llc which serves as the operating partnership’s sole general partner 

the preipo transactions will be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control utilizing historical cost basis in our 2017 financial statements accordingly after january 31 2017 the consolidated financial statements of invitation homes inc will recognize the assets and liabilities received in conjunction with the preipo transactions at their historical carrying amounts as reflected in the combined and consolidated financial statements of the ih holding entities   

on february 6 2017 invitation homes inc changed its jurisdiction of incorporation to maryland the preipo transactions also included amendments to the invitation homes inc charter which provide for the issuance of up to 9000000000 shares of common stock 

on february 6 2017 invitation homes inc completed an initial public offering of 88550000  shares of common stock at a price to the public of 2000 per share the “ipo” an additional 225116760  shares of common stock were issued to the preipo owners including shares held by directors officers and employees as part of the preipo transactions 

risk management 

we face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic housing market and interest rate risks to more specific factors such as credit risk related to our residents releasing of properties and competition for properties we believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced executive team since commencing our operations allow us to monitor manage and ultimately navigate these risks for example we seek to minimize bad debt expense through our robust standardized resident screening process which includes credit checks evaluations of household income and criminal background checks as well as by utilizing automated clearing house which includes an autopay feature to facilitate the collection of the majority of our rental payments in addition we track resident delinquency on a daily basis and assess any late fees promptly in accordance with the terms of our lease typically between the third and fifth calendar day of the month 

insurance 

we maintain property liability and corporatelevel insurance coverage related to our business including crime and fidelity directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability cyber liability employment practice liability and workers’ compensation insurance we believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss the cost of the coverage and industry practice however our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and carveouts and we are selfinsured up to the amount of such deductibles and carveouts see part i item 1a “risk factors—risks related to our business and industry—we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance” 

systems and technology 

effective systems and technology are essential components of our business we have made significant investments in our lease management property and corporate accounting and asset management systems these systems have been designed to be scalable to accommodate continued growth in our portfolio of singlefamily homes for lease our website is fully integrated into our resident accounting and leasing system from our website which is accessible from mobile devices prospective residents can browse homes available for rent request additional information and apply to rent a specific home through our online resident portal existing residents can set up automatic payments our system is designed to handle the accounting requirements of residential property accounting including accounting for security deposits and paying propertylevel expenses the system also interfaces with our third party resident screening vendor partner to expedite evaluations of prospective resident rental applications we have worked with a search engine optimization firm to ensure we place high in search engine lists and will continue to monitor our placement on search engines in addition sponsored key words are generally purchased in selected markets as needed 

competition 

we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and renting our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be rented or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other reits that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages

 item 1a risk factors 

the risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this annual report describe certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement and should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets 

our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership and rental of residential real estate many of which are beyond our control including without limitation 

 • the liquidity of real estate investments generally 

• the shortterm nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in releasing 

• changes in laws including those that increase operating expenses or limit our ability to increase rental rates 



 any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are employing a business model with a limited track record which may make our business difficult to evaluate 

until recently the singlefamily rental business consisted primarily of private and individual investors in local markets and was managed individually or by small noninstitutional owners and property managers our business strategy involves purchasing renovating maintaining and managing a large number of residential properties and leasing them to qualified residents entry into this market by large wellcapitalized investors is a relatively recent trend so few peer companies exist and none have yet established longterm track records that might assist us in predicting whether our business model and investment strategy can be implemented and sustained over an extended period of time it may be difficult for you to evaluate our potential future performance without the benefit of established longterm track records from companies implementing a similar business model we may encounter unanticipated problems as we continue to refine our business model which may adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and cause our share price to decline significantly 

we  have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business successfully or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders 

we have a limited operating history as a result an investment in our common stock may entail more risk than an investment in the common stock of a real estate company with a substantial operating history if we are unable to operate our business successfully we would not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your ownership in our common stock our ability to successfully operate our business and implement our operating policies and investment strategy depends on many factors including 

 in addition we face significant competition in acquiring attractive properties on advantageous terms and the value of the properties that we acquire may decline substantially after we purchase them 

we  may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

since commencing operations in 2012 we have grown rapidly assembling a portfolio of nearly 50000 homes as of december 31 2016  our future operating results may depend on our ability to effectively manage our growth which is dependent in part upon our ability to 



 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our properties or grow our business efficiently or effectively or without incurring significant additional expenses any failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

a  significant portion of our costs and expenses are fixed and we may not be able to adapt our cost structure to offset declines in our revenue 

many of the expenses associated with our business such as real estate taxes hoa fees personal and property taxes insurance utilities acquisition renovation and maintenance costs and other general corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and will not necessarily decrease with a reduction in revenue from our business some components of our fixed assets depreciate more rapidly and require ongoing capital expenditures our expenses and ongoing capital expenditures are also affected by inflationary increases and certain of our cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period or market by contrast our rental income is affected by many factors beyond our control such as the availability of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in our markets in addition state and local regulations may require us to maintain properties that we own even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the value of the property or any potential benefit from renting the property or pass regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates as a result we may not be able to fully offset rising costs and capital spending by increasing rental rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

increasing  property taxes hoa fees and insurance costs may negatively affect our financial results 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of property taxes and insuring our properties is a significant component of our expenses our properties are subject to real and personal property taxes that may increase as tax rates change and as the real properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities as the owner of our properties we are ultimately responsible for payment of the taxes to the applicable government authorities if real property taxes increase our expenses will increase if we fail to pay any such taxes the applicable taxing authority may place a lien on the real property and the real property may be subject to a tax sale 

in addition a significant portion of our properties are located within hoas and we are subject to hoa rules and regulations hoas have the power to increase monthly charges and make assessments for capital improvements and common area repairs and maintenance property taxes hoa fees and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases which can be outside of our control if the costs associated with property taxes hoa fees and assessments or insurance rise significantly and we are unable to increase rental rates due to rent control laws or other regulations to offset such increases our results of operations would be negatively affected 

we  have recorded net losses in the past and we may experience net losses in the future 

we have recorded combined and consolidated net losses in the years ended december 31 2016  2015 and 2014 these net losses were inclusive in each period of significant noncash charges consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense we expect such noncash charges to continue to be significant in future periods and as a result we may likely continue to record net losses in future periods 

we  are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect us we also face intense competition for the employment of highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel  

we rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies and the loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition the implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel competition for highly skilled managerial investment financial and operational personnel is intense as additional large real estate investors enter into and expand their scale within the singlefamily rental business we have faced increased challenges in hiring and retaining personnel and we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required our growth and operating results could be adversely affected 

our investments are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry which exposes us to seasonal fluctuations in rental demand and downturns in our markets or in the singlefamily properties sector 

our investments in real estate assets are and will continue to be concentrated in our markets and in the singlefamily properties sector of the real estate industry a downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for singlefamily housing caused by adverse economic regulatory or environmental conditions or other events in our markets may have a greater impact on the value of our properties or our operating results than if we had more fully diversified our investments we believe that there are seasonal fluctuations in rental demand with demand higher in the spring and summer than in the late fall and winter such seasonal fluctuations may impact our operating results 

in addition to general regional national and international economic conditions our operating performance will be impacted by the economic conditions in our markets we base a substantial part of our business plan on our belief that property values and operating fundamentals for singlefamily properties in our markets will continue to improve over the near to intermediate term however these markets have experienced substantial economic downturns in recent years and could experience similar or worse economic downturns in the future we can provide no assurance as to the extent property values and operating fundamentals in these markets will improve if at all if the recent economic downturn in these markets returns or if we fail to accurately predict the timing of economic improvement in these markets the value of our properties could decline and our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more geographically diversified which could adversely affect our financial condition operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may not be able to effectively control the timing and costs relating to the renovation and maintenance of our properties which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

nearly all of our properties require some level of renovation either immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise we may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate we may also acquire properties that we expect to be in good condition only to discover unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures to the extent properties are leased to existing residents renovations may be postponed until the resident vacates the premises and we will pay the costs of renovating in addition from time to time we may perform ongoing maintenance or make ongoing capital improvements and replacements and perform significant renovations and repairs that resident deposits and insurance may not cover because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately monitor or manage any such renovations or maintenance may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated 

our properties have infrastructure and appliances of varying ages and conditions consequently we routinely retain independent contractors and trade professionals to perform physical repair work and are exposed to all of the risks inherent in property renovation and maintenance including potential cost overruns increases in labor and materials costs delays by contractors in completing work delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship if our assumptions regarding the costs or timing of renovation and maintenance across our properties prove to be materially inaccurate our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 

we face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents which may limit our ability to lease our singlefamily homes on favorable terms 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties we face competition for residents from other lessors of singlefamily properties apartment buildings and condominium units competing properties may be newer better located and more attractive to residents potential competitors may have lower rates of occupancy than we do or may have 

superior access to capital and other resources which may result in competing owners more easily locating residents and leasing available housing at lower rental rates than we might offer at our homes many of these competitors may successfully attract residents with better incentives and amenities which could adversely affect our ability to obtain quality residents and lease our single family properties on favorable terms additionally some competing housing options may qualify for government subsidies that may make such options more accessible and therefore more attractive than our properties this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge 

in addition increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of potential residents which may decrease the overall number of qualified residents for our properties within such markets we could also be adversely affected by overbuilding or high vacancy rates of homes in our markets which could result in an excess supply of homes and reduce occupancy and rental rates continuing development of apartment buildings and condominium units in many of our markets will increase the supply of housing and exacerbate competition for residents 

in addition improving economic conditions along with the availability of low residential mortgage interest rates and government sponsored programs to promote home ownership have made home ownership more accessible for potential renters who have strong credit these factors may encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them thereby causing a decline in the number and quality of potential residents available to us 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain suitable residents if we are unable to lease our homes to suitable residents we would be adversely affected and the value of our common stock could decline 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past which could adversely impact anticipated yields 

we intend to continue to acquire properties from time to time consistent with our investment strategy even if the rental and housing markets are not as favorable as they have been in the recent past future acquisitions of properties may be more costly than those we have acquired previously the following factors among others may make acquisitions more expensive 

 we plan to continue acquiring properties as long as we believe such properties offer an attractive total return opportunity accordingly future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than recent past and present opportunities and if such future acquisitions are funded through equity issuances the yield and distributable cash per share will be reduced and the value of our common stock may decline 

competition in identifying and acquiring our properties could adversely affect our ability to implement our business and growth strategies which could materially and adversely affect us 

in acquiring our properties we compete with a variety of institutional investors including other reits specialty finance companies public and private funds savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies institutional investors investment banking firms financial institutions governmental bodies and other entities we also compete with individual private home buyers and small scale investors 

certain of our competitors may be larger in certain of our markets and may have greater financial or other resources than we do some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us in addition any potential competitor may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating constraints associated with qualification for taxation as a reit which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments competition may result in fewer investments higher prices a broadly dispersed portfolio of properties that 

does not lend itself to efficiencies of concentration acceptance of greater risk lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our financing costs in addition competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of our capital which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and finance investments that are consistent with our investment objectives or to achieve positive investment results and our failure to accomplish any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

compliance with governmental laws regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties or that may be passed in the future including permit license and zoning requirements may adversely affect our ability to make future acquisitions or renovations result in significant costs or delays and adversely affect our growth strategy 

rental homes are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements including permitting licensing and zoning requirements local regulations including municipal or local ordinances restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties including prior to acquiring any of our properties or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties among other things these restrictions may relate to fire and safety seismic asbestoscleanup or hazardous material abatement requirements additionally such local regulations may cause us to incur additional costs to renovate or maintain our properties in accordance with the particular rules and regulations we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations or that additional regulations will not be adopted that would increase such delays or result in additional costs our business and growth strategies may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to obtain permits licenses and approvals our failure to obtain such permits licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on us and cause the value of our common stock to decline 

tenant  relief laws including laws regulating evictions rent control laws and other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates may negatively impact our rental income and profitability 

as the landlord of numerous properties we are involved from time to time in evicting residents who are not paying their rent or who are otherwise in material violation of the terms of their lease eviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that raise our costs and expose us to potential negative publicity the eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers mandatory “cure” policies our internal policies and procedures and other sources of expense and delay each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property additionally state and local landlordtenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord’s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord’s premises because such laws vary by state and locality we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlordtenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance to the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals in class actions or actions by state or local law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer we may be required to pay our adversaries’ litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation 

furthermore state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates which may affect our rental income especially in times of recession and economic slowdown rent control initiatives can acquire significant political support if rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected 

we  may become a target of legal demands litigation including class actions and negative publicity by tenant and consumer rights organizations which could directly limit and constrain our operations and may result in significant litigation expenses and reputational harm 

numerous tenant rights and consumer rights organizations exist throughout the country and operate in our markets and we may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands litigation and negative publicity while we intend to conduct our business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlordtenant and consumer laws such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against us on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief and to seek to publicize our activities in a negative light we cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek 

additionally such organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against us may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain or limit our business operations adversely impact our business or may generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation if they are successful in any such endeavors they could directly limit and constrain our operations and may impose on us significant litigation expenses including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions 

our evaluation of properties involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate which could result in us paying too much for properties we acquire andor overvaluing our properties or our properties failing to perform as we expect 

we are authorized to follow a broad investment policy established by our board of directors and subject to implementation by our management our board of directors periodically reviews and updates the investment policy and also reviews our portfolio of residential real estate but it generally does not review or approve specific property acquisitions our success depends on our ability to acquire properties that can be quickly renovated repaired upgraded and rented with minimal expense and maintained in quality condition in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria we make a number of assumptions including among other things assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames annual operating costs market rental rates and potential rent amounts time from purchase to leasing and resident default rates these assumptions may prove inaccurate particularly since the properties that we acquire vary materially in terms of renovation quality and type of construction geographic location and hazards as a result we may pay too much for properties we acquire andor overvalue our properties or our properties may fail to perform as anticipated adjustments to the assumptions we make in evaluating potential purchases may result in fewer properties qualifying under our investment criteria including assumptions related to our ability to lease properties we have purchased 

our dependence upon third parties for key services may have an adverse effect on our operating results or reputation if the third parties fail to perform 

though we are internally managed we use local and national third party vendors and service providers to provide certain services for our properties for example we typically engage third party home improvement professionals with respect to certain maintenance and specialty services such as heating ventilation and air conditioning systems “hvac” roofing painting and floor installations selecting managing and supervising these third party service providers requires significant resources and expertise and because our portfolio consists of geographically dispersed properties our ability to adequately select manage and supervise such third parties may be more limited or subject to greater inefficiencies than if our properties were more geographically concentrated we generally do not have exclusive or longterm contractual relationships with these third party providers and we can provide no assurance that we will have uninterrupted or unlimited access to their services if we do not select manage and supervise appropriate third parties to provide these services our reputation and financial results may suffer notwithstanding our efforts to implement and enforce strong policies and practices regarding service providers we may not successfully detect and prevent fraud misconduct incompetence or theft by our third party service providers in addition any removal or termination of third party service providers would require us to seek new vendors or providers which would create delays and adversely affect our operations poor performance by such third party service providers will reflect poorly on us and could significantly damage our reputation among desirable residents in the event of fraud or misconduct by a third party we could also be exposed to material liability and be held responsible for damages fines or penalties and our reputation may suffer 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process which could subject us to significant risks that could adversely affect us 

we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire some of our homes through the auction process including auctions of homes that have been foreclosed upon by third party lenders of the   48298   homes in our portfolio as of   december 31 2016  approximately 29  were acquired at auction on an “as is” basis  such auctions may occur simultaneously in a number of markets including monthly auctions on the same day of the month in certain markets as a result we may only be able to visually inspect properties from the street and will purchase these homes without a contingency period and in “as is” condition with the risk that unknown defects in the property may exist upon acquiring a new home we may have to evict residents who are in unlawful possession before we can secure possession and control of the home the holdover occupants may be the former owners or residents of a property or they may be squatters or others who 

are illegally in possession securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and timeconsuming or generate negative publicity for our business and harm our reputation 

allegations of deficiencies in auction practices could result in claims challenging the validity of some auctions potentially placing our claim of ownership to the properties at risk since we do not obtain title insurance policies for properties we acquire through the auction process until we place the property into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing such instances or such proceedings may result in a complete loss without compensation 

title defects could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

our title to a property may be challenged for a variety of reasons and in such instances title insurance may not prove adequate for example while we do not lend to homeowners and accordingly do not foreclose on a home our title to properties we acquire at foreclosure auctions may be subject to challenge based on allegations of defects in the foreclosure process undertaken by other parties in addition we have in the past and may from time to time in the future acquire a number of our properties on an “as is” basis at auctions or otherwise of the   48298   homes in our portfolio as of   december 31 2016  approximately 29  were acquired at auction on an “as is” basis when acquiring properties on an “as is” basis title commitments are often not available prior to purchase and title reports or title information may not reflect all senior liens which may increase the possibility of acquiring houses outside predetermined acquisition and price parameters purchasing residences with title defects and deed restrictions hoa restrictions on leasing or purchasing the wrong residence without the benefit of title insurance prior to closing although we use various policies procedures and practices to assess the state of title prior to purchase and obtain title insurance once an acquired property is placed into a securitization facility in connection with a mortgage loan financing there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective which could lead to a material if not complete loss on our investment in such properties 

for properties we acquire at auction we similarly do not obtain title insurance prior to purchase and we are not able to perform the type of title review that is customary in acquisitions of real property as a result our knowledge of potential title issues will be limited and no title insurance protection will be in place this lack of title knowledge and insurance protection may result in third parties having claims against our title to such properties that may materially and adversely affect the values of the properties or call into question the validity of our title to such properties without title insurance we are fully exposed to and would have to defend ourselves against such claims further if any such claims are superior to our title to the property we acquired we risk loss of the property purchased 

increased scrutiny of title matters could lead to legal challenges with respect to the validity of the sale in the absence of title insurance the sale may be rescinded and we may be unable to recover our purchase price resulting in a complete loss title insurance obtained subsequent to purchase offers little protection against discoverable defects because they are typically excluded from such policies in addition any title insurance on a property even if acquired may not cover all defects or the significant legal costs associated with obtaining clear title 

any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results cash flows and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with bulk portfolio acquisitions and dispositions 

we have acquired and disposed of and may continue to acquire and dispose of properties we acquire or sell in bulk from or to other owners of singlefamily homes banks and loan servicers when we purchase properties in this manner we often do not have the opportunity to conduct interior inspections or conduct more than cursory exterior inspections on a portion of the properties such inspection processes may fail to reveal major defects associated with such properties which may cause the amount of time and cost required to renovate andor maintain such properties to substantially exceed our estimates moreover to the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with our property management and leasing standards we may be subject to a variety of risks including risks relating to the condition of the properties the credit quality and employment stability of the residents and compliance with applicable laws among others in addition financial and other information provided to us regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate and   we may not discover such inaccuracies until it is too late to seek remedies against such sellers to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the seller in an action seeking damages for such inaccuracies if we conclude that certain individual properties purchased in bulk portfolio sales do not fit our target 

investment criteria we may decide to sell rather than renovate and rent such properties which could take an extended period of time and may not result in a sale at an attractive price 

from time to time we engage in bulk portfolio dispositions of properties consistent with our business and investment strategy with respect to any such disposition the purchaser may default on payment or otherwise breach the terms of the relevant purchase agreement and it may be difficult for us to pursue remedies against such purchaser or retain or resume possession of the relevant properties to the extent we pursue such remedies we may not be able to successfully prevail against the purchaser 

contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and operating results 

assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties unpaid real estate tax utilities or hoa charges for which a subsequent owner remains liable cleanup or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations claims of customers vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities and tax liabilities purchases of singlefamily properties acquired at auction in short sales from lenders or in portfolio purchases typically involve few or no representations or warranties with respect to the properties and may allow us limited or no recourse against the sellers such properties also often have unpaid tax utility and hoa liabilities for which we may be obligated but fail to anticipate as a result the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition additionally such properties may be subject to covenants conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties including prohibitions on leasing we may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate such properties as we intend 

in particular under a florida statutory framework implemented by certain florida jurisdictions a violation of the relevant building codes zoning codes or other similar regulations applicable to a property may result in a lien on that property and all other properties owned by the same violator and located in the same county as the property with the code violation even though the other properties might not be in violation of any code until a municipal inspector verifies that the violation has been remedied and any applicable fines have been paid additional fines accrue on the amount of the lien and lien may not be released in each case even at those properties that are not in violation as a practical matter it might be possible to obtain a release of these liens without remedying the property in violation through other methods such as payment of an amount to the relevant county although no assurance can be given that this will necessarily be an available option or how long such a process would take 

a significant number of our residential properties are part of hoas and we and our residents are subject to the rules and regulations of such hoas which are subject to change and which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation with such hoas which would be costly 

a significant number of our properties are located within hoas which are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision the hoas in which we own our properties may have enacted or may from time to time enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict our ability to restore market lease or operate our properties in accordance with our investment strategy or require us to restore or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned budgets some hoas impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes which if met or exceeded would cause us to incur additional costs to sell the property and opportunity costs of lost rental revenue furthermore we may have residents who violate hoa rules and incur fines for which we may be liable as the property owner and for which we may not be able to obtain reimbursement from the resident additionally the governing bodies of the hoas in which we own property may not make important disclosures about the properties or may block our access to hoa records initiate litigation restrict our ability to sell our properties impose assessments or arbitrarily change the hoa rules we may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with hoa rules before purchasing a property and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause us to sell such property at a loss prevent us from renting such property or otherwise reduce our cash flow from such property which would have an adverse effect on our returns on these properties 

environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect us 

under various federal state and local environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on such property such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by applicable environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs incurred in addition third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury natural resources or property damage or other costs including investigation and cleanup costs resulting from the environmental contamination the presence of hazardous or toxic substances on one of our properties or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property could give rise to a lien in favor of the government for costs it may incur to address the contamination or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated a property owner who violates environmental laws may be subject to sanctions which may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances private parties in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties we may be exposed to such costs the cost of defending against environmental claims of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements or of remediating any contaminated property could materially and adversely affect us 

compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us we may be subject to environmental laws or regulations relating to our properties such as those concerning leadbased paint mold asbestos proximity to power lines or other issues we cannot assure you that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by the activities of residents existing conditions of the land operations in the vicinity of the properties or the activities of unrelated third parties in addition we may be required to comply with various local state and federal fire health lifesafety and similar regulations failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines andor damages suspension of personnel civil liability or other sanctions 

vacant  properties could be difficult to lease which could adversely affect our revenues 

the properties we acquire may often be vacant at the time of closing and we may not be successful in locating residents to lease the individual properties that we acquire as quickly as we had expected or at all even if we are able to place residents as quickly as we had expected we may incur vacancies in the future and may not be able to release those properties without longerthanassumed delays which may result in increased renovation and maintenance costs in addition the value of a vacant property could be substantially impaired as a result if vacancies continue for a longer period of time than we expect or indefinitely we may suffer reduced revenues which may have a material adverse effect on us 

we  rely on information supplied by prospective residents in managing our business 

we make leasing decisions based on our review of rental applications completed by the prospective resident while we may seek to confirm or build on information provided in such rental applications through our own due diligence including by conducting background checks we rely on the information supplied to us by prospective residents to make leasing decisions and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective resident and we do not require residents to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases notwithstanding the fact that this information can and frequently does change over time for example increases in unemployment levels or adverse economic conditions in certain of our markets may adversely affect the creditworthiness of our residents in such markets even though this information is not updated we will use it to evaluate the characteristics of our portfolio over time if residentsupplied information is inaccurate or our residents’ creditworthiness declines over time we may make poor or imperfect leasing decisions and our portfolio may contain more risk than we believe 

we  depend on our residents and their willingness to meet their lease obligations and renew their leases for substantially all of our revenues poor resident selection and defaults and nonrenewals by our residents may adversely affect our reputation financial performance and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we depend on rental income from residents for substantially all of our revenues as a result our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified residents for our properties our reputation financial performance and 

ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected if a significant number of our residents fail to meet their lease obligations or fail to renew their leases for example residents may default on rent payments make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities use our properties for illegal purposes damage or make unauthorized structural changes to our properties that are not covered by security deposits refuse to leave the property upon termination of the lease engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances disturb nearby residents with noise trash odors or eyesores fail to comply with hoa regulations sublet to less desirable individuals in violation of our lease or permit unauthorized persons to live with them 

damage to our properties may delay releasing after eviction necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental income or value of the property resulting in a lower than expected rate of return increases in unemployment levels and other adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could result in substantial resident defaults in the event of a resident default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord at that property and will incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property 

our leases are relatively shortterm exposing us to the risk that we may have to release our properties frequently which we may be unable to do on attractive terms on a timely basis or at all 

substantially all of our new leases have a duration of one to two years as such leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term we anticipate our rental revenues may be affected by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms shortterm leases may result in high turnover which involves costs such as restoring the properties marketing costs and lower occupancy levels our resident turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base such estimates if the rental rates for our properties decrease or our residents do not renew their leases our operating results and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 

declining  real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we periodically review the value of our properties to determine whether their value based on market factors projected income and generally accepted accounting principles has permanently decreased such that it is necessary or appropriate to take an impairment loss in the relevant accounting period such a loss would cause an immediate reduction of net income in the applicable accounting period and would be reflected in a decrease in our balance sheet assets the reduction of net income from impairment losses could lead to a reduction in our dividends both in the relevant accounting period and in future periods even if we do not determine that it is necessary or appropriate to record an impairment loss a reduction in the intrinsic value of a property would become manifest over time through reduced income from the property and would therefore affect our earnings and financial condition 

we  are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business which may in turn negatively affect us and the value of our common stock 

our operations are dependent upon our resident portal and property management platforms including yardi and salesforce which include certain automated processes that require access to telecommunications or the internet each of which is subject to system security risks certain critical components of our platform are dependent upon third party service providers and a significant portion of our business operations are conducted over the internet as a result we could be severely impacted by a catastrophic occurrence such as a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or a circumstance that disrupted access to telecommunications the internet or operations at our third party service providers including viruses or experienced computer programmers that could penetrate network security defenses and cause system failures and disruptions of operations even though we believe we utilize appropriate duplication and backup procedures a significant outage in telecommunications the internet or at our third party service providers could negatively impact our operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store 

sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our prospective and current residents employees and third party service providers the secure processing and maintenance of such information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed publicly disclosed misused lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information regulatory penalties disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation any of which could adversely affect our results of operations reputation and competitive position 

future joint venture investments may limit our ability to invest in certain markets and may be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on joint venture partners’ financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners 

although we currently wholly own and manage our properties we may decide to coinvest in the future with third parties through partnerships joint ventures or other entities acquiring noncontrolling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property partnership joint venture or other entity as a result if we decide to make any such joint venture investments in the future we may be subject to restrictions that prohibit us from making other investments in certain markets until all of the funds in such partnership joint venture or other entity are invested or committed and we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity which may among other things impact our ability to satisfy the reit requirements investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments also may have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor our partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently actions by or disputes with any of our future partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of any of our future third party partners or coventurers 

we are involved in a variety of litigation 

we are involved in a range of legal actions in the ordinary course of business these actions may include among others eviction proceedings and other landlordtenant disputes challenges to title and ownership rights disputes arising over potential violations of hoa rules and regulations issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of the property outside vendor disputes and trademark infringement and other intellectual property claims these actions can be timeconsuming and expensive and may adversely affect our reputation for example eviction proceedings by owners and operators of singlefamily homes for lease have recently been the focus of negative media attention although we are not involved in any legal or regulatory proceedings that we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition such proceedings may arise in the future 

we may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance 

we attempt to ensure that our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses however there are certain losses including losses from floods fires earthquakes wind pollution acts of war acts of terrorism or riots for which we may selfinsure or which may not always or generally be insured against because it may not be deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so changes in the cost or availability of insurance could expose us to uninsured casualty losses in particular a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to increased earthquake activity or wind andor flood risk properties located in active seismic areas include properties throughout california and seattle a number of our properties are also located in florida and charlotte which are areas known to be subject to wind andor flood risk while we have multiyear policies for earthquakes and hurricane andor flood risk our properties may nonetheless incur a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance in such an event the value of the affected properties would be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss and we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential 

revenues in such properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with such properties inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a particular property after it has been damaged or destroyed under those circumstances the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position on the damaged or destroyed property any such losses could adversely affect us and cause the value of our common stock to decline in addition we may have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct the damaged home and we cannot assure that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future 

we  are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather 

natural disasters and severe weather such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes or floods may result in significant damage to our properties the extent of our casualty losses and loss in operating income in connection with such events is a function of the severity of the event and the total amount of exposure in the affected area 

when we have geographic concentration of exposures a single catastrophe such as an earthquake especially in california or destructive weather event such as a hurricane affecting a region may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result our operating and financial results may vary significantly from one period to the next our financial results may be adversely affected by our exposure to losses arising from natural disasters or severe weather 

eminent  domain could lead to material losses on our investments in our properties 

governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire the land on which our properties are built in order to build roads and other infrastructure any such exercise of eminent domain would allow us to recover only the fair value of the affected properties in addition “fair value” could be substantially less than the real market value of the property for a number of years and we could effectively have no profit potential from properties acquired by the government through eminent domain 

we  may have difficulty selling our real estate investments and our ability to distribute all or a portion of the net proceeds from any such sale to our stockholders may be limited 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and as a result we may have a limited ability to sell our properties when we sell any of our properties we may recognize a loss on such sale we may elect not to distribute any proceeds from the sale of properties to our stockholders instead we may use such proceeds for other purposes including 

• purchasing additional properties 

• repaying debt or buying back shares 

• creating working capital reserves or 

• making repairs maintenance or other capital improvements or expenditures to our remaining properties 

our ability to sell our properties may also be limited by our need to avoid the 100 prohibited transactions tax that is imposed on gain recognized by a reit from the sale of property characterized as dealer property for example we may be required to hold our properties for a minimum period of time and comply with certain other requirements in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or dispose of our properties through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” in which case we will incur corporate level tax on any net gains from such dispositions 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our  cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing 

we are generally subject to risks associated with debt financing these risks include 1 our cash flow may not be sufficient to satisfy required payments of principal and interest 2 we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of the refinancing may be less favorable to us than the terms of existing debt 3 required debt payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines 4 debt service obligations could reduce funds available for 

distribution to our stockholders and funds available for capital investment 5 any default on our indebtedness could result in acceleration of those obligations and possible loss of property to foreclosure and 6 the risk that necessary capital expenditures cannot be financed on favorable terms if a property is pledged to secure payment of indebtedness and we cannot make the applicable debt payments we may have to surrender the property to the lender with a consequent loss of any prospective income and equity value from such property any of these risks could place strains on our cash flows reduce our ability to grow and adversely affect our results of operations 

we utilize a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of our business 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 75703 million  aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding including 52547 million  of nonrecourse assetbacked mortgage loans our leverage could have important consequences to us for example it could 1 result in the acceleration of a significant amount of debt for noncompliance with the terms of such debt or if such debt contains cross default or crossacceleration provisions other debt 2 result in the loss of assets including individual properties or portfolios due to foreclosure or sale on unfavorable terms which could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds 3 materially impair our ability to borrow unused amounts under existing financing arrangements or to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all 4 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our indebtedness reducing the cash flow available to fund our business to pay dividends including those necessary to maintain our reit qualification or to use for other purposes 5 increase our vulnerability to an economic downturn 6 limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or 7 reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

if any of the foregoing occurs our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us our inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business among other things we could have great difficulty acquiring redeveloping or maintaining our properties which would materially and adversely affect our business strategy and portfolio and may result in our 1 liquidity being adversely affected 2 inability to repay or refinance our indebtedness on or before its maturity 3 making higher interest and principal payments or selling some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to service our indebtedness or 4 issuing additional capital stock which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

secured  indebtedness exposes us to the possibility of foreclosure on our ownership interests in our rental homes 

incurring mortgage and other secured indebtedness increases our risk of loss of our ownership interests in our rental homes because defaults thereunder and the inability to refinance such indebtedness may result in foreclosure action initiated by lenders for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our rental homes would be treated as a sale of the home for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home if the outstanding balance of the indebtedness secured by such rental home exceeds our tax basis in the rental home we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without receiving any cash proceeds 

covenants  in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition 

our existing debt agreements contain and future debt agreements may contain financial andor operating covenants including among other things certain coverage ratios as well as limitations on the ability to incur secured and unsecured debt these covenants may limit our operational flexibility and acquisition and disposition activities moreover if any of the covenants in these debt agreements are breached and not cured within the applicable cure period we could be required to repay the debt immediately even in the absence of a payment default as a result a default under applicable debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

for example our mortgage loans require among other things that a cash management account controlled by the lender collect all rents and cash generated by the properties securing the portfolio upon the occurrence of an event of default or failure to satisfy the required minimum debt yield or debt service coverage ratio the lender may apply any excess cash as the 

lender elects including prepayment of principal and amounts due under the loans these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders further such restrictions could make it difficult for us to satisfy the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

we  have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans and such structures may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings which could affect the availability and attractiveness of this financing option or otherwise result in losses to us 

we have and expect to continue to utilize nonrecourse longterm mortgage loans relating to pools of homes which we own if and when they become available and to the extent consistent with the maintenance of our reit qualification in order to generate cash for funding new investments mortgage loans may expose us to certain risks not prevalent in other debt financings for example accounting rules for mortgage loans are complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities and possible changes in accounting rules interpretations or our assumptions could undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements moreover we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future or be able to do so at favorable rates the global economy recently experienced a significant recession and recent events in the real estate and securitization markets as well as the debt markets and the economy generally have caused significant dislocations illiquidity and volatility in the market for assetbacked securities and mortgage backed securities as well as a severe ongoing disruption in the wider global financial markets including a significant reduction of investor demand for and purchases of assetbacked securities and structured financial products disruptions of the securitization market could preclude our ability to use mortgage loans as a financing source or could render it an inefficient source of financing making us more dependent on alternative sourcing of financing that might not be as favorable as mortgage loans in otherwise favorable markets in addition in the united states and elsewhere there is now increased political and regulatory scrutiny of the assetbacked securities industry this has resulted in a raft of measures for increased regulation which are currently at various stages of implementation and which may have an adverse impact on the regulatory capital charge to certain investors in securitization exposures or the incentives for certain investors to hold assetbacked securities and may thereby affect the liquidity of such securities any of these factors could limit our access to mortgage loans as a source of financing the inability to consummate mortgage loans to finance our investments on a longterm basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price which could adversely affect our performance and our ability to grow our business 

offerings of additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we decide to issue additional debt securities or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock in the future it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility any additional debt or equity securities that we issue in the future may have rights preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and if such securities are convertible or exchangeable the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to owners of our common stock we and indirectly our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stockholdings in us 

failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

borrowings under our debt instruments bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease after giving effect to i the debt repayments made in connection with the completion of the ipo ii borrowings under the new credit facility and iii interest rate swap agreements that we entered into in december 2016 and january 2017 see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” for more information about each each 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate indebtedness would result in a 228 million change in annual interest expense 

in connection with our debt instruments we have obtained interest rate caps and swaps and subject to complying with the requirements for reit qualification we may obtain in the future one or more additional forms of interest rate protection—in the form of swap agreements interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements—to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder in addition we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our investments in order to meet our debt service obligations 

the reit provisions of the code may also limit our ability to hedge effectively see “—risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items—complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities” 

risks related to our organization and structure 

we are controlled by our sponsor and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

affiliates of our sponsor beneficially own approximately 71  of our common stock moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders’ agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates so long as our preipo owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 5 of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we will nominate individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the “sponsor directors” for election to our board of directors as specified in our stockholders’ agreement and our sponsor must consent to any change to the number of our directors even when our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during such time our sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the election and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the singlefamily rental sector in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders our charter provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition our sponsor may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the new york stock exchange “nyse” and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements 

affiliates of our sponsor control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the nyse under these rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the requirements that within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock 

 we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition although we have a fully independent audit committee and have independent director representation on our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize these “controlled company” exemptions accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 

we  incur increased costs and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business 

as a public company we incur additional legal accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company including costs associated with public company reporting requirements we also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and related rules implemented by the sec and the nyse the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty these laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as our executive officers furthermore if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company we could be subject to delisting of our common stock fines sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with our second annual report on form 10k under the securities act we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act once we are no longer an emerging growth company our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis the process of designing implementing and testing the internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective or if once we are no longer an emerging growth company our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

we  are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of 

 we take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our per share trading price may be adversely affected and more volatile 

provisions  of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us by requiring our board of directors or stockholders to approve proposals to acquire our company or effect a change in control 

certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price of their shares of common stock including 

 we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl and provide that any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the mgcl in addition pursuant to a provision in our bylaws we opted out of the control share provisions of the mgcl provisions of our bylaws will prohibit our board of directors from revoking altering or amending its resolution exempting any business combination from the business combination provisions of the mgcl or amending our bylaws to opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in each case without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

in addition the “unsolicited takeover” provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit our board of directors without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws to implement certain takeover defenses including adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director such takeover defenses may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price our charter provides that without the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we may not elect to be subject to certain provisions of subtitle 8 including the provisions relating to adopting a classified board or increasing the vote required to remove a director 

our board of directors may approve the issuance of stock including preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 

our charter permits our board of directors without any action by our stockholders to authorize the issuance of stock in one or more classes or series our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued stock and set or change the preferences conversion and other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of any such stock which rights may be superior to those of our common stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of a class or series of stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common stock 

our board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval 

our investment financing borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities including growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by our board of directors these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders our charter also provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit in addition our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements a change in these policies or the termination of our reit election could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

our  rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law under current maryland law and our charter our directors and officers do not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter authorizes us and our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each of our directors or officers who is or is threatened to be made a party to or witness in a proceeding by reason of his or her service in those or certain other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as a present or former director or officer of us or serving in such other capacities in addition we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights to recover money damages from our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent these provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies which could limit your recourse in the event of actions that are not in our best interests 

our  charter contains a provision that expressly permits our sponsor our nonemployee directors and certain of our preipo owners and their affiliates to compete with us 

our sponsor may compete with us for investments in properties and for residents there is no assurance that any conflicts of interest created by such competition will be resolved in our favor moreover our sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and acquires and holds interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in or any right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunities that are from time to time presented to or developed by our directors or their affiliates other than to those directors who are employed by us or our subsidiaries unless the business opportunity is expressly offered or made known to such person in his or her capacity as our director and none of our sponsor preipo owners or any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or any of his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we or our affiliates engage or propose to engage or to refrain from otherwise competing with us or our affiliates our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

our charter provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law our sponsor and each of our nonemployee directors including those designated by our sponsor and any of their affiliates may 

 our charter also provides that to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by maryland law in the event that our sponsor any nonemployee director or any of their respective affiliates acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and may take any such opportunity for itself himself or herself or offer it to another person or entity unless the business opportunity is expressly offered to such person in his or her capacity as our director these provisions may limit our ability to pursue business or investment opportunities that we might otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our cash flow the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders 

we are required to disclose in our periodic reports filed with the sec specified activities engaged in by our “affiliates” 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 “itrshra” which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran more specifically section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving 

iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain office of foreign assets control sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under us law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees 

the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation to determine whether sanctions should be imposed under itrshra we would be required to report if we or any of our “affiliates” knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report because the sec defines the term “affiliate” broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of our sponsor affiliates of our sponsor may also be considered our affiliates affiliates of our sponsor have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activity even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business 

risks related to our reit status and certain other tax items 

if  we do not maintain our qualification as a reit we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability 

we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code however qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist notwithstanding the availability of cure provisions in the code we could fail to meet various compliance requirements which could jeopardize our reit status furthermore new tax legislation administrative guidance or court decisions in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year then 

 reits  in certain circumstances may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit we may become subject to us federal income taxes and related state and local taxes for example net income from the sale of properties that are “dealer” properties sold by a reit a “prohibited transaction” under the code will be subject to a 100 tax we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to reits similarly if we were to fail an income test and did not lose our reit status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our investments and pay income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file us federal income tax returns and seek a refund of such tax we also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property including income franchise payroll mortgage recording and transfer taxes either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets such as our trss which are subject to full us federal state local and foreign corporatelevel income taxes any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 

complying  with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

in order to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in commercial real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to 

stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution thus compliance with reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

complying  with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments 

in order to qualify as a reit we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets the remainder of our investments in securities other than qualified real estate assets and government securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer unless we and such issuer jointly elect for such issuer to be treated as a trs under the code the total value of all of our investments in taxable reit subsidiaries cannot exceed 25 20 for any taxable year beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in addition no more than 5 of the value of our assets other than qualified real estate assets and government securities can consist of the securities of any one issuer other than a trs if we fail to comply with these requirements we must dispose of a portion of our assets within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 

complying  with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets each such hedge a “borrowings hedge” or to manage risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any item of qualifying income each such hedge a “currency hedge” if clearly identified under applicable us treasury “treasury” regulations does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that we must satisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit this exclusion from the 95 and 75 gross income tests also will apply if we previously entered into a borrowings hedge or a currency hedge a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new properly identified hedging transaction to offset the prior hedging position to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or subject to the limitations on the value of and income from our trss implement those hedges through a domestic trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses from hedges held in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trs 

complying  with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to stockholders 

from time to time our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may be unable to distribute substantially all of our taxable income as required by the reit provisions of the code thus we could be required to borrow funds sell a portion of our assets at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative these options could increase our costs or reduce our equity 

even if we qualify to be subject to us federal income tax as a reit we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net builtin gains in certain assets 

as part of our preipo transactions we acquired certain appreciated assets that are held directly or indirectly in part by one or more c corporations in transactions in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such assets in the hands of such c corporations if we dispose of any such appreciated assets during the fiveyear period following the date we acquired those assets we will be subject to us federal income tax on the portion of such gain attributable to such c corporations at the highest corporate tax rates to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such assets on the date that we acquired those assets over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date which are referred to as builtin gains we would be subject to this tax liability even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and our distribution requirement any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets we might otherwise sell during the fiveyear period in which the builtin gain tax applies to avoid the built in gain tax however there can be no assurances 

that such a taxable transaction will not occur if we sell such assets in a taxable transaction the amount of corporate tax that we will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net builtin gain or loss present in those assets as of the time we acquired those assets and the portion of such assets which were held by c corporations prior to their contribution to us 

our charter does not permit any person to own more than 98 of our outstanding common stock or of our outstanding stock of all classes or series and attempts to acquire our common stock or our stock of all other classes or series in excess of these 98 limits would not be effective without an exemption from these limits by our board of directors 

for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than 50 of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals including certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose during the last half of a taxable year for the purpose of assisting our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes among other purposes our charter prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than a certain percentage currently 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or 98 in value of the outstanding shares of our stock which we refer to as the “ownership limit” the constructive ownership rules under the code and our charter are complex and may cause shares of the outstanding common stock owned by a group of related persons to be deemed to be constructively owned by one person as a result the acquisition of less than 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock by a person could cause a person to own constructively in excess of 98 of our outstanding common stock or our stock respectively and thus violate the ownership limit there can be no assurance that our board of directors as permitted in the charter will not decrease this ownership limit in the future any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of our board of directors will result either in the shares in excess of the limit being transferred by operation of the charter to a charitable trust and the person who attempted to acquire such excess shares will not have any rights in such excess shares or in the transfer being void the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding a change in control of us by a third party even if such change in control would be in the best interests of our stockholders or would result in receipt of a premium to the price of our common stock and even if such change in control would not reasonably jeopardize our reit status in addition our board of directors granted an exemption from the ownership limit to our sponsor and its affiliates which may limit our board of directors’ power to increase the ownership limit or grant further exemptions in the future 

we may choose to make distributions in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay income taxes without receiving any cash dividends 

in connection with our qualification as a reit we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain in order to satisfy this requirement we may make distributions that are payable in cash andor shares of our common stock which could account for up to 90 of the aggregate amount of such distributions at the election of each stockholder taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes as a result us stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received accordingly us holders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a us stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to certain nonus holders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such distribution including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed in addition if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

various tax aspects of such a taxable cashstock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the internal revenue service “irs” no assurance can be given that the irs will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cashstock distributions including on a retroactive basis or assert that the requirements for such taxable cashstock distributions have not been met 

dividends payable by reits do not generally qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to certain noncorporate us stockholders has been reduced by legislation to 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause certain noncorporate investors to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits including our common stock 

we are dependent on external sources of capital to finance our growth 

as with other reits but unlike corporations generally our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital because we generally have to distribute to our stockholders 90 of our reit taxable income in order to qualify as a reit including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash our access to external capital depends upon a number of factors including general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock 

in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of us federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares although reits generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the approval of our stockholders 

according to publicly released statements a top legislative priority of the trump administration and the next congress may be significant reform of the code including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense there is a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on an investment in us 

liquidation  of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 

to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory 

our ownership of and relationship with any trs will be restricted and a failure to comply with the restrictions would jeopardize our reit status and may result in the application of a 100 excise tax 

a reit may own up to 100 of the stock of one or more trss a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35 of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than 25 and for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 no more than 20 of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss the value of our interests in and thus the amount of assets held in a trs may also be restricted by our need to qualify for an exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” a trs will pay us federal state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns in 

addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a 100 excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis 

any trs we own as a domestic corporation will pay us federal state and local income tax on its taxable income and its aftertax net income is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us the aggregate value of the trs stock and securities owned by us cannot exceed 25 and for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 20 of the value of our total assets including the trs stock and securities although we plan to monitor our investments in trss there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the 25 or 20 as applicable limitation discussed above or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

we have elected to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders we expect that the cash required to fund our dividends will be covered by cash generated by operations however our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend upon the performance of our asset portfolio if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds raise additional equity capital sell assets or reduce such distributions if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference over our common stock as to distributions all distributions will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in its investment to the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

our share price may decline due to the large number of our shares eligible for future sale 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of our common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate we had a total of 313666760  shares of our common stock outstanding as of march   30 2017  including shares underlying 3290126  restricted stock units issued at the time of the ipo all of the 88550000  shares of our common stock sold in the ipo are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the securities act by persons other than our “affiliates” 

the remaining 225116760  shares of our common stock outstanding held by our preipo owners other than shares underlying restricted stock units that were granted to directors officers and employees at the time of the ipo issued under our omnibus incentive plan are “restricted securities” within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and may not be sold in the absence of registration under the securities act unless an exemption from registration is available including the exemptions contained in rule 144 at the time of the ipo we made certain awards to executives employees and directors in an amount of 658 million as awards under our omnibus incentive plan the shares underlying such grants are registered under the securities act and are not restricted securities 

we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register 16000000 shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our omnibus incentive plan which automatically became effective upon filing accordingly shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market 

our charter provides that we may issue up to 9000000000 shares of common stock and 900000000 shares of preferred stock 001 par value per share moreover under maryland law and as provided in our charter our board of directors has the power to amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue without stockholder approval future issuances of shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock may dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders because our decision to issue additional equity or convertible or exchangeable securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future issuances in addition we are not required to offer any such securities to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis therefore it may not be possible for existing stockholders to participate in such future issuances which may dilute the existing stockholders’ interests in us similarly the agreement of limited partnership of our operating partnership authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of op units of our operating partnership which may be exchangeable for shares of our common stock 

the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by market conditions and by our actual and expected future earnings and level of cash dividends 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of shares without regard to our operating performance for example the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates one of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments an increase in market interest rates or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments as a result if interest rates rise it is possible that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interestbearing securities increase in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and in response the market price of our shares could decrease significantly the market value of the equity securities of a reit is also based upon the market’s perception of the reit’s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions whether from operations sales or refinancings and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets for that reason our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock and in such instances you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the ipo price

market information 

on february 6 2017 we closed an initial public offering of our common stock at price to the public of 2000 per share prior to that time there was no public market for our stock our common stock is traded on the nyse under the symbol “invh” 

holders   

as of march   30 2017  the number of holders of record of our common stock was 30 this figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares of our common stock are frequently held in “street name” by securities dealers and others for the benefit of beneficial owners who may vote the shares 

dividends   

we have elected to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes the code generally requires that a reit annually distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain and imposes tax on any reit taxable income retained by a reit including capital gains to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit and to avoid paying tax on our income we intend to make quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains to our stockholders 

although we anticipate initially making quarterly distributions to our stockholders the timing form and amount of distributions if any to our stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity maintenance of our reit qualification and other tax considerations capital expenditure and other obligations debt covenants contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we may be required to fund distributions from working capital borrow funds sell assets or reduce such distributions our board of directors reviews the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors including the revenues we receive from our properties our operating expenses interest expense and unanticipated expenditures among others for more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations please see part i item ia “risk factors” 

there were no cash distributions to holders of our common equity during the year ended december 31 2016  

recent sale of unregistered securities   

on october 4 2016 invitation homes inc issued 100 shares of its common stock par value 001 per share to invitation homes 2a lp for 100 in cash the issuance of such shares of common stock was not registered under the securities act because the shares were offered and sold in a transaction by the issuer not involving any public offering exempt from registration under section 4a2 of the securities act 

in connection with the ipo on january 31 2017 we and our preipo owners including our sponsor effected certain transactions that resulted in the operating partnership holding directly or indirectly all of the assets liabilities and operations reflected in our combined and consolidated financial statements including the full portfolio of homes held by the ih holding entities upon consummation of these transactions our preipo owners acquired an aggregate of 225116760  shares of common stock of invitation homes inc including underlying restricted stock units that were granted to directors officers and employees such securities were issued in reliance on the exemption contained in section 4a2 of the securities act as transactions by issuers not involving a public offering no general solicitation or underwriters was involved in such issuances 

use of proceeds   

on february 6 2017 we completed the ipo in which we sold 88550000 shares of common stock including 11550000 shares of common stock that were subject to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares at an initial public offering price of 2000 per share the shares offered and sold in the ipo were registered under the securities act pursuant to our registration statement on form s11 file no 333215452 which was declared effective by the sec on january 31 2017 the offering did not terminate until after the sale of all 88550000 shares of common stock registered on the registration statement the aggregate offering price for the shares registered and sold by us was approximately 17710 million the underwriters of the offering were led by deutsche bank securities inc jp morgan securities llc merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated goldman sachs  co wells fargo securities llc credit suisse securities usa llc morgan stanley  co llc and rbc capital markets llc 

the ipo generated net proceeds of approximately 16670 million  to us after net underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 789 million  and other offering expenses of approximately 255 million  blackstone advisory partners lp an underwriter in the offering is an affiliate of our sponsor and received underwriting fees of approximately 40 million no other offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers or their associates persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock or any other affiliates we used a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo together with the borrowings under the term loan facility the “term loan facility” of our new credit facility to repay our existing credit facilities and our mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20131 securitization and a portion of the mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20141 securitization transaction and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering 

in march 2017 we used the remaining ipo proceeds together with cash on hand to voluntarily prepay approximately 2600 million of additional borrowings outstanding under the mortgage loan relating to the ih1 20141 securitization transaction reducing the outstanding principal balance to approximately 4210 million

in april 2012 we began purchasing singlefamily rental homes and by december 31 2012 we owned over 11000 homes in 12 markets our rapid acquisition pace continued and by december 31 2013 and 2014 our portfolio included approximately 39000 and 46000 homes respectively and had expanded to 13  markets across 10 states since inception we have invested approximately 13000 million  of additional capital in the form of improvements into our homes that we still own as part of the initial renovation of acquired homes as well as ongoing general maintenance and upkeep 

as of december 31 2016  we owned 48298  singlefamily rental homes and had an additional 63 homes in escrow that we expected to acquire subject to customary closing conditions as of december 31 2016  we had 36469  homes in our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2014 references to our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease 90 days prior to the first day of the first year of the comparison period for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  are for these 36469  homes references to our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease 90 days prior to the first day of the first year of the comparison period for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014  are to a same store portfolio of 18762 homes 

we have historically funded the purchase and renovation of our singlefamily rental homes with a combination of equity capital warehouse loans from our sponsor and borrowings under credit facilities of up to 75 of the acquisition and renovation costs of our singlefamily homes in november 2013 we were the first singlefamily residential rental home owner and operator to securitize a loan on certain of our homes through the creation of a new type of residential real estate assetbacked securitization class that combines characteristics of traditional residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbs” and commercial mortgagebacked securities “cmbs” like rmbs the underlying assets of this new type of residential real estate assetbacked securitization are singlefamily homes like cmbs the underlying borrower for this new type of residential real estate assetbacked securitization is a business not an individual homeowner and the cash flow comes from rental rather than mortgage payments we refer to these securitized loans as our “mortgage loans”  this initial mortgage loan financing totaled 4791 million  and to date we have executed a total of 53340 million  of mortgage loan financings to refinance certain of our credit facility balances

factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors many of which are beyond our control key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals property acquisitions and renovations rental rates and occupancy levels turnover and days to reresident homes property improvements and maintenance and financing arrangements 

market fundamentals   our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets particularly in the western united states and florida which represented 724  of our revenues during the three months ended december 31 2016  in recent periods our western united states and florida markets have experienced favorable demand fundamentals with employment growth and household formation rates that have exceeded the us averages while exhibiting a greater decline in the rate of new supply deliveries measured by total housing permits as a percentage of households from their longterm averages than the united states on the whole we believe these favorable supply and demand fundamentals have driven strong rental rate growth and home price appreciation for our western united states and florida markets in recent periods compared to the us average and we expect these trends to continue in the near to intermediate term 

property acquisitions and renovations  future growth in rental revenues and operating income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes our pace of property acquisitions and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home our ability to identify and acquire singlefamily homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels and competition for our target assets the acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price including payments for acquisition fees property inspections closing costs title insurance transfer taxes recording fees broker commissions property taxes and hoa fees when applicable additionally we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental renovation work varies but may include paint flooring carpeting cabinetry appliances plumbing hardware roof replacement hvac replacement and other items required to prepare the home for rental the time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance the time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons including the property’s acquisition channel the condition of the property and whether the property was vacant when acquired due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

rental rates and occupancy levels  rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and propertylevel factors including market conditions seasonality resident defaults and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and release homes when residents vacate an important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases which typically have a term of one to two years 

turnover and days to reresident  other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include increasing the length of stay of our residents minimizing resident turnover rates and reducing the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents our operating results also are impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property the period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand our marketing techniques the size of our available inventory and economic conditions and outlook increases in turnover rates and the average number of days to reresident increase property operating and maintenance expenses and reduce rental revenues as the homes are not generating income during this period 

property improvements and maintenance  property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures property operating and maintenance expense and rental revenues we actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures due to our size and scale both nationally and locally we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices 

financing arrangements  financing arrangements directly impact interest expense credit facilities mortgage loans and warehouse loans as well as our ability to acquire and renovate homes we have historically utilized credit facilities and warehouse loans to acquire and renovate new homes in certain instances we have refinanced our credit facilities and warehouse loans utilizing mortgage loans our current financing arrangements contain variable interest rate terms along with certain financial covenants interest rates are impacted by the characteristics of our homes market conditions and the terms 

of the underlying financing arrangements see “—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding interest rate risk our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts interest rates financial covenants and durations 

recent events

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015   

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  



rental revenues 

as of december 31 2016 and 2015  we owned 48298  and 48138  singlefamily rental homes respectively generating rental revenue of 8780 million  and 8002 million  respectively for the years then ended rental revenues increased   97  due to an increase  in both average occupancy and average monthly rent per occupied home as well as the increase in number of homes owned during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  we acquired 1253  and 3576  homes respectively and sold 1093  and 1481  homes respectively 

average occupancy for the total portfolio was 945  and 934  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the increase in average occupancy correlates with the decrease in the number of homes acquired during 2016  compared to 2015  as homes are unoccupied for a longer period of time during initial renovations than during a reresident period average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2016  was 1611  compared to 1515  for the year ended december 31 2015  a 63  increase 

for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2014  our average occupancy was 959  and 961  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively and our average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2016  was 1613  compared to 1545  for the year ended december 31 2015  a 44  increase 

to monitor prospective changes in average rent per occupied home we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home in each case net of any amortized concessions leases are either renewal leases where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term or a new lease where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home the following information regarding our renewal leases and new leases is with respect to our total portfolio for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 55  and 51  respectively for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 55  and 43  respectively 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  the turnover rate for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2014  was 352  and 343  respectively for our total portfolio an average home remained unoccupied for 42  days between residents for each of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  

other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  other property income was 446 million  and 358 million  respectively a 244   increase  the primary drivers of the increase  were utility recoveries and miscellaneous revenues associated with the ongoing implementation of our national lease which standardized resident fees across the portfolio 

operating expenses 

operating expenses were 7318 million  and 7217 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively a 14   increase  set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of operating expenses 

property operating and maintenance expense increased  to 3603 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 3480 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  due to the increase in the number of homes owned in 2016  and increases in property taxes for homes owned in both periods partially offset by reduced marketlevel personnel expense 

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased  to 996 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 1189 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  due to efficiencies from lower headcount a decrease  in noncash incentive compensation expense of 177 million  and a reduction in severance expense of 52 million these reductions were partially offset by   130 million   of expenses incurred in 2016 in preparation for the ipo   noncash incentive compensation expense decreased due to an overall reduction in the number of vesting class b units and in the weighted average fair value per unit of previously issued nonemployee class b units this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of new class b units issued during the year  ended   december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  

depreciation and amortization expense increased  due to the increase in the number of homes owned and placed into service 

interest expense 

interest expense was 2860 million  and 2737 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively a 45   increase  the increase  in interest expense was due to an increase in the average monthly libor rates of 30 basis points from 020 to 050 during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2016  respectively and the recognition of 87 million  of unrealized losses related to nondesignated interest rate hedges partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred financing costs of 184 million  and a reduction in average debt balances outstanding as of december 31 2016  we had 75703 million  of debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs and discounts compared to 77260 million  as of december 31 2015  a 20  decrease the decrease in debt outstanding was attributable to the payoff of our warehouse loans as well as 2190 million  of repayments on our credit facilities credit facility borrowings totaled 1847 million  and were utilized to fund acquisitions and improvements 

gain on sale of property 

gain on sale of property was 186 million  and 23 million  f or the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively  of the 1093  homes sold during the year ended   december 31 2016  590 were sold in bulk sales for a gain of 94 million of the 1481  homes sold during the  year ended   december 31 2015  1314 homes were sold in bulk sales for a 

gain of 15 million the primary driver for the difference in the gain on sale between periods was the composition of homes sold during the respective periods 

year ended   december 31 2015   compared to year ended   december 31 2014   

the following table sets forth a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014  



rental revenues 

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we owned 48138 and 46043 singlefamily rental homes respectively generating rental revenue of 8002 million and 6311 million respectively for the years then ended rental revenues increased 268 due to an increase in both average occupancy and average monthly rent per occupied home as well as the increase in number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we acquired 3576 and 7183 homes respectively and sold 1481 and 100 homes respectively 

average occupancy for the total portfolio was 934 and 859 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in average occupancy correlates with the decrease in the number of homes acquired during 2015 compared to 2014 as homes are unoccupied for a longer period of time during initial renovations than during a reresident period average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was 1515 compared to 1424 for the year ended december 31 2014 a 64 increase 

for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2013 our average occupancy was 962 and 956 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively and our average rent per occupied home in actual dollars for the year ended december 31 2015 was 1502 compared to 1451 for the year ended december 31 2014 a 35 increase

for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 the turnover rate for our same store portfolio consisting of homes which had commenced their initial postrenovation lease prior to october 3 2013 was 344 and 328 respectively for our total portfolio the number of days an average home remained unoccupied between residents was 42 and 47 days for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

other property income 

for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 other property income was 358 million and 276 million respectively a 298 increase the primary drivers for the increase were utility recoveries and miscellaneous revenues 

operating expenses 

operating expenses were 7217 million and 6905 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively a 45 increase the net increase in operating expenses was driven by the following 

property operating and maintenance expense increased to 3480 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 3207 million for the year ended december 31 2014 due to the increase in the number of homes owned in 2015 and increases in property taxes for homes owned in both periods partially offset by reduced marketlevel personnel expense 

property management expense and general and administrative expense decreased to 1189 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 1507 million for the year ended december 31 2014 due to efficiencies from lower headcount and a reduction in severance expense of 80 million these reductions were partially offset by an increase in noncash incentive compensation expense of 36 million due to the issuance of additional class b units which was partially offset by an overall decrease in the weighted average fair value per unit of class b units previously issued to nonemployees 

depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the increase in the number of homes owned during the year ended december 31 2015 

interest expense 

interest expense was 2737 million and 2358 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively a 161 increase the increase in interest expense was due to the increase in debt outstanding during the two years as of december 31 2015 we had 77260 million of debt outstanding net of deferred financing costs compared to 65646 million as of december 31 2014 a 177 increase the increase in debt outstanding was attributable to increased leverage from mortgage loans of 23709 million which were used to repay 19550 million of our credit facilities additional credit facility borrowings totaled 9016 million and were utilized to fund acquisitions and improvements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2016  and 2015  included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1981 million  and 2748 million  respectively a 279   decrease  due primarily to repayments of certain of our indebtedness which is discussed in further detail in “—cash flows” 

liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements maintain our assets fund our operations make distributions and dividend payments to our equity investors and meet other general requirements of our business our liquidity to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our nearterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i renovating newlyacquired homes ii funding hoa fees as applicable real estate taxes insurance premiums and the ongoing maintenance for our homes iii interest expense and iv payment of dividends to our equity investors our longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our homes and principal payments on our indebtedness 

we will seek to satisfy our longterm liquidity needs through cash provided by operations longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt and equity securities and property dispositions we have financed our operations and acquisitions to date through cash provided by operations capital contributions from our equity investors and financing arrangements we believe our rental income net of operating expenses will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and distributions and dividend payments on a nearterm basis our real estate assets are illiquid in nature a timely 

liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of shortterm liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives such as the revolving facility in the amount of 10000 million that we entered into on february 6 2017 

as a reit invitation homes inc will be required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income excluding net capital gain on an annual basis therefore as a general matter it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs from our annual taxable income instead we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts if any by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income 

we have historically utilized credit facilities mortgage loans and warehouse loans from our sponsor to fund acquisitions and renovation improvements as of december 31 2016  we have repaid all outstanding borrowings under the warehouse loans and do not expect to obtain warehouse loans from our sponsor in the future subsequent to december 31 2016  we repaid all obligations outstanding under the existing credit facilities and the ih1 20131 mortgage loan and made repayments totaling 5515 million on the ih1 20141 mortgage loan as further described and defined below we entered into a new credit facility on february 6 2017 which includes a 10000 million revolving line of credit component that is currently undrawn and a fully drawn 15000 million term loan component 

the following describes the key terms and conditions of our current credit facilities mortgage loans and warehouse loans

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no obligations assets or liabilities that would be considered offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  consisted of the following 





 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our combined and consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the sec the preparation of combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates for a discussion of recentlyissued and adopted accounting standards see “notes to combined and consolidated financial statements note 2—significant accounting policies” 

as an emerging growth company we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under section 102b of the jobs act 

investments in singlefamily residential properties   

upon acquisition we evaluate our acquired singlefamily residential properties for purposes of determining whether a transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination in general acquisitions of singlefamily residential properties with an inplace lease are treated as a business combination under asc 805 business combinations   

substantially all of our transactions are asset acquisitions recorded at their purchase price and the purchase price is allocated between land and building and improvements based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition the purchase price for purposes of this allocation is inclusive of acquisition costs which typically include legal fees bidding service and title fees payments made to cure tax utility  hoa fees when applicable  and other mechanic’s and miscellaneous liens as well as other closing costs 

transactions determined to be business combinations are recorded at the purchase price which approximates fair value and the purchase price is allocated to land building and improvements and the inplace lease intangibles based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are reflected in other expenses in  our combined and consolidated statements of operations the fair values of acquired inplace lease intangibles are based on the costs to execute similar leases including commissions and other related costs the origination value of inplace lease intangibles also includes an estimate of lost rent revenue at inplace rental rates during the estimated time required to lease the property the inplace lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the leases and are recorded in other assets net in our combined and consolidated balance sheets  

cost capitalization   

we incur costs to acquire stabilize and prepare our singlefamily residential properties to be rented we capitalize these costs as a component of our investment in each singlefamily residential property using specific identification and relative allocation methodologies including renovation costs and other costs associated with activities that are directly related to preparing our properties for use as rental real estate other costs include interest costs property taxes property insurance utilities hoa fees  when applicable and the salaries and benefits of the manager’s employees who are directly responsible for the execution of our stabilization activities the capitalization period associated with our stabilization activities begins at such time that activities commence and concludes at the time that a singlefamily residential property is available to be leased   

once a property is ready for its intended use expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs thereafter are expensed to operations as incurred and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home and for certain furniture and fixtures additions the determination of which costs to capitalize requires significant judgment accordingly many factors are considered as part of our evaluation processes with no one factor necessarily determinative   

provisions for impairment   

we continuously evaluate by property whether there are any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our singlefamily residential properties may not be recoverable examples of such events and changes in circumstances that we consider include significant and persistent declines in an individual property’s net operating income regional changes in home price appreciation as measured by certain independently developed indices change in expected use of the property significant adverse legal factors substantive damage to the individual property as a result of natural disasters and other risks inherent in our business not covered by insurance proceeds or a current expectation that a property will be disposed of prior to the end of its estimated useful life   

to the extent an event or change in circumstance is identified a residential property is considered to be impaired only if its carrying value cannot be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property cash flow projections are prepared using internal analyses based on current rental renewal and occupancy rates operating expenses and inputs from our annual planning process that give consideration to each property’s historical results current operating trends and current market conditions to the extent an impairment has occurred the carrying amount of our investment in a property is adjusted to its estimated fair value to determine the estimated fair value we primarily consider local broker price opinions “bpos” in order to validate the bpos received and used in our assessment of fair value of real estate we perform an internal review to determine if an acceptable valuation approach was used to estimate fair value in compliance with guidance provided by asc 820 fair value measurements  additionally we undertake an internal review to assess the relevance and appropriateness of comparable transactions that have been used by the broker in its bpo and any adjustments to comparable transactions made by the broker in reaching its value opinion   

the process whereby we assess our singlefamily residential properties for impairment requires significant judgment and assessment of factors that are at times subject to significant uncertainty we evaluate multiple information sources and 

perform a number of internal analyses each of which are important components of our process with no one information source or analysis being necessarily determinative   

revenue recognition and resident receivables   

rental revenue net of any concessions is recognized monthly as it is earned on a straightline basis over the term of the lease other property income is recognized when earned and realized or realizable   

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of residents to make required rent or other payments this allowance is estimated based on among other considerations payment histories and overall delinquencies the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a reduction of rental revenues and other property income in our combined and consolidated statements of operations   

noncash incentive compensation expense   

we recognize noncash incentive compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the incentive compensation units and vesting conditions of the related incentive unit agreements ih1’s incentive units were granted to employees of the manager our wholly owned subsidiary therefore the noncash incentive compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value of the units and recognized in expense over the service period additional compensation expense is recognized if modifications to existing incentive unit agreements result in an increase in the postmodification fair value of the units that exceeds their premodification fair value because units in  the ih2 promote partnerships as defined in “part iii item 11  “ executive compensation” ih3 ih4 and ih5 were granted to nonemployees of those respective partnerships fair value is remeasured for unvested units at the end of each reporting period the fair value of all incentive units is determined based on a valuation model that takes into account discounted cash flows and a market approach based on comparable companies and transactions  noncash incentive compensation expense is presented as a component of general and administrative expense and property management expense in our combined and consolidated statements of operations

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker “codm” in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance our codm is the chief executive officer   

under the provision of asc 280 segment reporting  we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring renovating leasing and operating singlefamily homes as rental properties including singlefamily homes in planned unit developments the codm evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis the codm utilizes net operating income as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio the aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level 

nongaap measures 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap before the following items interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda before the following items noncash incentive compensation expense offering related expenses impairment and other acquisition costs gain loss on sale of property and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors and commercial banks set forth below is additional detail on how management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as measures of performance 

our management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda in a number of ways to assess our combined and consolidated financial and operating performance and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in 

identifying trends in our performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results accordingly we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the shortterm namely our cost structure and expenses 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income or loss ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the ebitda and adjusted ebitda of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda as determined in accordance with gaap on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated 





 net operating income 

noi is a nongaap measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies we define noi for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense which consists primarily of property taxes insurance hoa fees when applicable marketlevel personnel expenses repairs and maintenance leasing costs and marketing noi excludes interest expense depreciation and amortization general and administrative expense property management expense impairment and other acquisition costs gain loss on sale of property and interest income and other miscellaneous income and expenses 

we consider noi to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap we believe noi is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations the gaap measure most directly comparable to noi is net income or loss noi is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure 

of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our noi may not be comparable to the noi of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of noi accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measure is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that same store noi is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as noi and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting noi for homes in our same store portfolio 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to noi for our total portfolio and noi for our same store portfolio as determined in accordance with gaap on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated 





 funds from operations core funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations 

ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo are supplemental nongaap measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets plus depreciation amortization and impairment of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization impairment on depreciated real estate investments as well as gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes from gaap net income or loss by excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate management uses ffo to measure returns on its 

investments in homes however ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 

management also believes that ffo combined with the required gaap presentations is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies the gaap measure most directly comparable to ffo is net income or loss ffo is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

we believe that core ffo and adjusted ffo are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as ffo and are further helpful to investors as they provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period we define core ffo as ffo adjusted for noncash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts related to our financing arrangements noncash interest expense for derivatives noncash incentive compensation expense offering related expenses severance expenses casualty losses net and acquisition costs as applicable we define adjusted ffo as core ffo less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality of our homes the gaap measure most directly comparable to core ffo and adjusted ffo is net income or loss core ffo and adjusted ffo are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap our core ffo and adjusted ffo may not be comparable to the core ffo and adjusted ffo of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of core ffo and adjusted ffo accordingly there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this nongaap measures is comparable with that of other companies 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo as determined in accordance with gaap on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated 










 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates seasonality market prices commodity prices and inflation the primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have we may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors 

interest rate risk 

a primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk which may result from many factors including government monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future including additional amounts that we may borrow under our credit facilities in addition decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of singlefamily homes which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on singlefamily homes targeted for acquisition significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire singlefamily homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the total outstanding balance of our variablerate debt was comprised of borrowings on our credit facilities of 23216  and 23559 million respectively our mortgage loans of 52640  and 53059 million respectively and our warehouse loans from our sponsor of 00 million  and 1140 million respectively total outstanding variablerate debt decreased   24  from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  all borrowings bear interest at libor plus the applicable spread assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing variable rate debt the following table illustrates the projected effect of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the libor rate on our annual interest expense as of december 31 2016  and 2015  



 

this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 

seasonality 

our business and related operating results have been and we believe that they will continue to be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year in particular we have experienced higher levels of resident moveouts during the summer months which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs further our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as hvac repairs costs to reresident and landscaping expenses during the summer season

annual cash incentive compensation 

our annual cash incentive compensation plan for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 the “2016 aip” compensated and rewarded successful achievement of financial and nonfinancial goals aligned with the goals of the company and incorporated a mix of operational and financial performance objectives as well as departmental goals corporate priorities and individual goals the operational and financial objective components of the award opportunity consisted of net operating income growth defined as the percentage yearoveryear change in net operating income in our same store portfolio where net operating income is defined as set forth under part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—nongaap measures” ebitda margin defined as ebitda as a percentage of total revenue of our total portfolio where ebitda is defined as set forth under part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—nongaap measures” as further adjusted for impairment expense expenses related to the ipo and gain loss on the sale of property and net cash flow defined as net operating income minus property capital expenditures minus leasing commissions paid plus lease cost amortization of mr bartling’s total award opportunity under the 2016 aip 40 of the award was based on net operating income growth 20 was based on ebitda margin 20 was based on net cash flow 10 was based on corporate priorities and 10 was based on individual goals of mr freedman’s total award opportunity under the 2016 aip 30 of the award was based on net operating income growth 15 was based on ebitda margin 15 was based on net cash flow 20 was based on departmental goals 10 was based on corporate priorities and 10 was based on individual goals of mr tanner’s total award opportunity under the 2016 aip 15 of the award was based on net operating income growth 75 was based on ebitda margin 75 was based on net cash flow 50 was based on departmental goals 10 was based on corporate priorities and 10 was based on individual goals 

each neo was eligible to receive a payout under the 2016 aip based on the level of the actual achievement of the abovedescribed performance measures and payouts were expressed as a percentage of the neo’s base salary earned for 2016 “eligible earnings” each neo’s target bonus opportunity was established under the terms of his employment 

agreement as may have been subsequently adjusted accordingly for fiscal 2016 mr bartling’s target bonus opportunity was 100 of his eligible earnings mr freedman’s was 150 and mr tanner’s was 125 

at the beginning of the 2016 aip performance period each performance measure was assigned a scale that based on actual achievement at the end of the performance period yielded a bonus score the resulting bonus score for each performance measure was then multiplied by the percentage of the total award opportunity that performance measure represented to arrive at an achievement factor the sum of the achievement factors was then multiplied by the executive’s award opportunity payable at target to determine the payout amount such executive was entitled to receive under the 2016 aip 

for the year ended december 31 2016 the scale for the net operating income growth performance measure provided for a bonus score of 50 if the net operating income growth achieved was 300 basis points below the target level a bonus score of 100 if the target level was achieved and a 150 bonus score if the net operating income growth was 300 or more basis points above the target level the scale for the ebitda margin performance measure provided for a 50 bonus score if the ebitda margin achieved was 200 basis points below the target level a 100 bonus score if the target level was achieved and a 150 bonus score if the ebitda margin achieved was 200 or more basis points above the target level the scale for the net cash flow performance measure provided for a 50 bonus score if the net cash flow achieved was 4 below the target level a 100 bonus score if the target level was achieved and a 150 bonus score if the net cash flow achieved was 4 or more above the target level bonus scores were interpolated on a straight line basis based on actual achievement between the threshold target and maximum levels with no payout for any performance measure that did not achieve the threshold level 

for 2016 net operating income growth achieved resulted in a 750 bonus score ebitda margin achieved resulted in a 918 bonus score and net cash flow achieved resulted in a 909 bonus score based on the neo’s departmental and individual goals achieved under the 2016 aip the annual cash incentive awards thereunder were payable as follows these amounts are reflected in the “nonequity incentive plan compensation” column of the summary compensation table

mr freedman in ih1 the ih2 promote partnerships and ih3 were scheduled to vest based on an october 14 2015 vesting reference date 

in connection with the ipo we converted all of the incentive units held by our executive officers other than the incentive units in ih1 the ih2 promote partnerships ih3 ih4 and ih5 held by mr tanner into shares of our common stock the number of shares received in this conversion was determined in a manner intended to replicate the respective economic value associated with the corresponding incentive units converted based on the valuation derived from the ipo price the vesting and other terms of the shares delivered in the conversion have the same vesting and other terms including the provisions described under “—termination and change in control provisions” applicable to the corresponding incentive units converted accordingly shares received in respect of vested incentive units are shares of vested common stock and shares received in respect of unvested timevesting and exitvesting incentive units are shares of unvested timevesting and exitvesting restricted stock as to mr tanner in december 2016 we waived the vesting conditions of all of his unvested incentive units whereby all of such incentive units were immediately vested there was no incremental fair value calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic 718 and fasb asc topic 505 as applicable in connection with this waiver and accelerated vesting mr tanner received in respect of his incentive units in ih1 the ih2 promote partnerships ih3 ih4 and ih5 similar vested limited partner interests in the partnerships that hold shares of our common stock and mr tanner’s incentive units in ih6 were converted into shares of our common stock in the same manner as that for incentive units held by our other executives as described above individual holders of class a units in the promote partnerships received shares of our common stock upon conversion of such units 

as a result of the valuation in the ipo messrs bartling and freedman received no vested common stock in exchange for their incentive units and mr tanner received no vested common stock in exchange for his incentive units in ih6 

the following table sets forth the number and value of vested restricted stock units messrs bartling freedman and tanner received in respect of their ih6 bonus awards
