general development of business 

​ 

ecolab was incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1924 our fiscal year is the calendar year ending december 31 international subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of their us gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america november 30 fiscal year ends to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in our consolidated financial reporting

​ 

on june 3 2020 we completed the previously announced separation of our upstream energy business the “championx business” in a reverse morris trust transaction the “transaction” through the splitoff of championx holding inc “championx” formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business followed immediately by the merger the “merger” of championx with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation fka apergy corporation “apergy”

​ 

as discussed in note 5 discontinued operations the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results therefore we reported the historical results of championx including the results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations and related assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified for all periods presented herein unless otherwise noted the accompanying financial information has been revised to reflect the effect of the separation of championx and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only 

​ 

subsequent to the separation of championx we no longer report the upstream energy segment which previously held the championx business we are aligned into three reportable segments and other 

​ 

effective in the first quarter of 2020 and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment which was also a reportable segment we eliminated the global energy reportable segment and created the downstream operating segment and the upstream operating segment which are reported in the global industrial reportable segment and newly established upstream energy reportable segment which is reported in discontinued operations respectively also in the first quarter of 2020 we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment additionally the textile care operating segment is reported in other which had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional  specialty reportable segment we made other immaterial changes including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments 

​ 

on december 1 2021 we acquired purolite for total consideration of 37 billion in cash purolite is a leading and fastgrowing global provider of highend ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions that is highly complementary to our current offering and critical to safe high quality drug production and biopharma product purification in the life sciences industries it also provides purification and separation solutions for critical industrial markets like microelectronics nuclear power and food and beverage headquartered in king of prussia pennsylvania purolite operates in more than 30 countries purolite is reported within our life sciences operating segment 

​ 

we continued to invest in and build our business through various acquisitions that complement our strategic vision see part ii item 8 note 4 of this form 10k for additional information about acquisitions and divestitures

additional information 

​ 

international operations 

​ 

we directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states

​ 

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations

​ 

competition 

​ 

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise innovation digital technology chemical formulations global customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment through the combination of our digitally enabled endtoend water management and hygiene solutions datadriven insights and personalized service our global industrial businesses deliver outcomes that help our customers optimize water and energy use improve productivity advance food safety and achieve sustainability and net zero goals while optimizing total cost of operations

​ 

the businesses in our global institutional  specialty reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support training service and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation and improve their operational efficiency

​ 

within the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment the healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories with few globally scaled competitors life sciences business competes in the european market versus several midsize and regional competitors and competes against two large and other midsize or regional competitors in north america outside of north america and europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as ecolab our businesses in this segment compete by enabling our customers success through improved hygiene digitally enabled programs in key operating room and patient room space as well as a tailored approach to delivering key inputs that directly impact our customers patients globally

​ 

sales 

​ 

our products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our companytrained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors and to a lesser extent sales agents are utilized in several markets as described in the segment descriptions found above

​ 

customers and classes of products 

​ 

we believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2021 2020 or 2019 we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit

​ 

we sold one class of products within the global institutional  specialty reportable segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 10 11 and 13 of consolidated net sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

​ 

environmental and regulatory considerations 

​ 

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air water chemical and product regulations could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products

​ 

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

​ 

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by several states 

​ 

environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area in 2017 california passed the cleaning product right to know act of 2017 that required ingredient transparency online and onlabel by 2020 and 2021 respectively new york has proposed similar ingredient disclosure regulation the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe”“safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

​ 

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency’s “epa” capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the tsca changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below

​ 

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” which aims to manage chemical safety risks reach established a european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met all reach registration requirements to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

​ 

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate adopted ghsrelated legislation by 2021 the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we have met applicable deadlines and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in remaining countries eg peru chile india potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position

​ 

in europe the biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met all relevant deadlines of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances and biocide products anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position the same is true for emerging biocide regulations in asia

​ 

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

​ 

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee medical device regulation eu 2017745 and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products

​ 

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements for certain digitally connected product offerings federal communication commission “fcc” and corresponding international requirements are applicable we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 28 million in 2021 and 18 million in 2020 approximately 50 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2022 the increase in the projected spend reflects a return to historical annual expenditure levels prior to the covid19 pandemic

​ 

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions we have not determined that any of these laws directly impact ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth 

​ 

furthermore climaterelated risks are assessed within our enterprise risk management process and annual business significance risks assessment which is aligned with recommendations of the financial stability board fsb task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd we report tcfd disclosures in our annual cdp climate report located at httpswwwecolabcomsustainabilitysustainabilityreportingresources we are evaluating further application of the recommendations of the tcfd in alignment with the recommended timeline from the tcfd 

 

ecolab recognizes that climate change poses potential risks and creates potential opportunities to our organization ecolab has taken steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities ecolab has been focused on assessing climate risks for the past three years leading up to our tcfdaligned climate risk assessment conducted in 2021 we will continue our efforts to assess additional climaterelated risks and opportunities including exploring our supply chain resiliency subsequently ecolab will review the results of our analysis and develop adaptation and management plans for any relevant climate change risks and to further benefit from identified opportunities for customer impact

​ 

to further bolster our climate commitment in 2019 we announced new goals to reduce our ghg emissions by half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 in alignment with the united nations global compact’s business ambition for 15⁰c in 2020 we further committed to move to 100 renewable energy by 2030 and set a sciencebased target sbt addressing our scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions our sbt commits us to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50 by 2030 from a 2018 base year and to work with our suppliers representing 70 of our scope 3 emissions to set sciencebased reduction targets by 2024 

​ 

in addition to managing our operational and supply chain sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than three million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and ghg emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services showcasing our global team’s dedication to helping our customers thrive and make a positive impact in the world we have set a 2030 goal to help our customers reduce their ghg emissions by 60 million metric tons

​ 

ecolab recognizes the climatewater nexus as part of our 2030 impact goals we have committed to restore greater than 50 of our water withdrawal and achieve alliance for water stewardship standard certification in highrisk watersheds in addition we aim to reduce net water withdrawals by 40 per unit of production across our enterprise we also magnify our impact through the watersaving solutions we deliver to our customers and have set a goal to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

​ 

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 19 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at three sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

​ 

​ 

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 05 million in 2021 and 06 million in 2020 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2021 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 60 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

economic  operational risks 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have materially and adversely impacted and we expect may continue to materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

​ 

beginning in march 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a rapid and significant negative impact on the global economy including a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries measures taken to alleviate the pandemic such as stayathome orders and other responsive measures significantly impacted our restaurant and hospitality customers and negatively affected demand for our products and services in these segments resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations while many of these measures eased through the third quarter of 2021 driving increased consumer traffic and inunit dining the spread of covid19 variants resulted in restrictions on activities in the fourth quarter particularly in geographies where vaccination rates lag continuing to impact consumer activity concerns remain that our markets could see a prolonged resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions in addition the covid19 pandemic continues to have a material effect on the macroeconomic environment including significant supply chain disruptions resulting from labor shortages disruptions to logistics networks and capacity constraints and there is continued uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact

​ 

we expect the full impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition to be dictated by future developments which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted such as the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the distribution acceptance and efficacy of vaccines the likelihood of a resurgence of the outbreak including as a result of emerging variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities intended to minimize the spread of the pandemic or to stimulate the economy and other unintended consequences in addition to the reduction in the demand for our products and services the covid19 pandemic has had and we expect will continue to have certain negative impacts on our business including but not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

our results could be materially and adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 

​ 

the prices of raw materials used in our business fluctuate and in recent years we have experienced periods of significant increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms has materially and adversely affected our business and can in the future materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may materially and adversely affect our business

​ 

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

​ 

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing refining pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the last two years we have experienced the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on the demand for our products and services provided to customers in the fullservice restaurant hospitality lodging and entertainment industries in prior years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe has also negatively impacted certain of our endmarkets during these periods of weaker economic activity our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

​ 

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors 

​ 

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future for example covid19 has impacted global supply chains for most products as well as led to disruption and volatility in global capital markets which increases the cost of capital and could potentially adversely impact access to capital covid19 has caused similar volatility in foreign currency markets increasing risk of unfavorable impacts on earnings due to significant fx rate movements recent political and economic upheaval in countries with ecolab operations such as russia turkey and argentina could also have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars

​ 

we are subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

​ 

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and random attack acquisitions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data security breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology we have experienced immaterial cybersecurity attacks and incidents and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption or legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business certain of our customer offerings include digital components such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations a breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential thirdparty claims and reputational damage there may be other related challenges and risks as we complete implementation of our erp system upgrade 

​ 

we depend on key personnel to lead our business the labor market is very dynamic in the wake of the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract retain and develop a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities to drive business growth development and profitability as we continue to grow our business make acquisitions expand our geographic scope and offer new products and services we need the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for executive officer and key employee roles in order to meet the growth development and profitability goals of our business our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract retain or develop such officers or key employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels more generally in the wake of the covid19 pandemic expectations from qualified talent in many areas of the labor market have evolved in light of this if we are unable to attract and retain employees on terms and conditions that are consistent with our historical operating model our business could be disrupted or our costs could increase which may materially and adversely affect our business

​ 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

​ 

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2021 approximately 48 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

​ 

 ​ 

changes in us or foreign government policy on international trade including the imposition or continuation of tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on certain imports from china and other countries resulting in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries while the us and china signed a phase one trade agreement in january 2020 which included the suspension and rollback of tariffs the us senate subsequently passed legislation in 2021 aimed at countering china’s technical ambitions and similar legislation was introduced in the house in 2022 any new tariffs imposed by the us china or other countries or any additional retaliatory measures by any of these countries could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations

​ 

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

​ 

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and nonus laws and regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and nonus economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such laws and regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations significant fines and sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in february 2022 following russia’s invasion of ukraine the us and other countries announced sanctions against russia the sanctions announced by the us and other countries against russia to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods services or technology in or from affected regions travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political military business and financial organizations in russia severing russia’s largest bank from the us financial system barring some russian enterprises from raising money in the us market and blocking the access of russian banks to financial markets the us and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate while it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions announced to date may have on ecolab any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the us or other countries and any retaliatory measures by russia in response such as restrictions on energy supplies from russia to countries in the region could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations

​ 

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

​ 

severe public health outbreaks may materially and adversely impact our business 

​ 

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic besides the covid19 pandemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business uncertainty with respect to the impact on our financial results of the covid19 pandemic is discussed further in management discussion  analysis located at part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the heading “global economic and political environment”

​ 

strategic risks 

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives including restructurings and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrades our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

we continue to execute key business initiatives including restructurings and investments to develop business systems as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we are undertaking the institutional advancement program and accelerate 2020 plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks reduce complexity and management layers consolidate facilities and focus on key long term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements as discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k additionally we are continuing implementation of our erp system upgrades which are expected to continue in phases over the next several years these upgrades which include sales supply chain and certain finance functions are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes these upgrades involve complex business process design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could materially and adversely be affected

​ 

our growth depends upon our ability to compete successfully with respect to value innovation and customer support  

​ 

we have numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high valueadded products technology and service we must also continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative profitable and high valueadded products for niche applications and commercial digital applications we have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings which are becoming an increasingly important part of our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

consolidation of our customers and vendors could materially and adversely affect our results 

​ 

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy life sciences food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our pricing margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that could impact our results 

​ 

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have a material adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the purolite acquisition 

​ 

we recently acquired purolite which operates in the highly regulated life sciences pharma and biopharma industries and has extensive international operations which complicate integration execution if we have difficulty integrating purolite operations or lose key employees or customers our business could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected  

​ 

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

legal regulatory  compliance risks 

​ 

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and meet our contractual commitments and failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our business and we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

​ 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws and anticorruption laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs a violation of these laws and regulations could expose us to financial liability that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows changes to labor and employment laws and regulations as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies could materially and adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability

​ 

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement personal injury product liability breach of contract wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

a chemical spill or release could materially and adversely impact our business 

​ 

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

​ 

with respect to the separation and subsequent splitoff of our upstream energy business we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with championx holding inc and championx corporation fka apergy corporation and taken together with championx holding inc “championx” as well as certain other agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and our relationship with championx going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and certain other obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between championx and us if we are required to indemnify championx under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial related liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which championx has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against championx will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that championx will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our business and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

​ 

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events d war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets e natural or manmade disasters f water shortages or g severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business

​ 

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

​ 

government shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by disrupting or delaying new product launches renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or export licenses for raw materials or products

​ 

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in particular the us gulf coast is a region with significant refining petrochemicals and chemicals operations which provide us raw materials as well as being an important customer base for our downstream and water operating segments hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the gulf coast such as the winter freeze in texas and the gulf coast in february 2021 can materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost or at all and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region

​ 

financial risks 

​ 

if the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the divestiture are determined to be taxable in whole or in part we and our stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

​ 

in connection with the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business that was consummated on june 3 2020 we obtained opinions of outside tax counsel that the related merger and exchange offer will qualify as taxfree transactions to us and our stockholders except to the extent that cash was paid to ecolab stockholders in lieu of fractional shares we have not sought or obtained a ruling from the internal revenue service irs on the tax consequences of these transactions an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts which may disagree with the opinion even if the merger and exchange offer otherwise qualified as taxfree transactions they may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either ecolab or championx corporation while championx corporation has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transactions not to qualify as taxfree transactions and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement the potential tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled if the merger or exchange offer were determined to be taxable we could be subject to a substantial tax liability and each us holder of our common stock who participated in the exchange offer could be treated as exchanging the ecolab shares surrendered for championx corporation shares in a taxable transaction

​ 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

​ 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states while the ultimate adoption of new tax legislation is uncertain it is possible that any such legislation may include increases to the tax rates at which income of us companies would be taxed we are also subject to changes in tax law outside the united states and actions taken with respect to taxrelated matters by associations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries and the european commission which influence tax policies in countries where we operate for example approximately 140 countries have agreed to the oecd’s twopillar base erosion and profit shifting project “beps” this framework which is expected to be implemented in some countries beginning in 2023 is focused on a number of issues including shifting taxing rights on income from residence countries to source countries and establishing a minimum 15 global tax rate some of the beps and related proposals if enacted into law in the united states and in the foreign countries where we do business could increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance the amount of taxes we incur in those jurisdictions and our global effective tax rate in addition we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

​ 

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

​ 

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established

​ 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

​ 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 88 billion in outstanding indebtedness with approximately 17 billion in the form of floating rate debt our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences including

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

if we add new debt the risks described above could increase

​ 

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco transaction and other acquisitions 

​ 

we expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 81 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and purolite transactions if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco transaction or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

comparability of results 

​ 

purolite acquisition 

​ 

on december 1 2021 we acquired purolite for total consideration of 37 billion in cash purolite is a leading and fastgrowing global provider of highend ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications headquartered in king of prussia pennsylvania purolite operates in more than 30 countries purolite is reported within our life sciences operating segment acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special gains and charges 

in addition the remaining impacts of the purolite acquisition including operating results acquisitionrelated amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results 

​ 

championx transaction 

​ 

on june 3 2020 we completed the previously announced separation of our upstream energy business the “championx business” in a reverse morris trust transaction the “transaction” through the splitoff of championx holding inc “championx” formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business followed immediately by the merger of championx the “merger” with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation fka apergy corporation “apergy” 

​ 

the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results therefore we report the historical results of championx including the results of operations cash flows and related assets and liabilities as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein unless otherwise noted the accompanying mda has been revised to reflect the championx business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only 

​ 

comparability of reportable segments 

​ 

effective in the first quarter of 2020 and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment which was also a reportable segment subsequent to the separation of championx we no longer report the upstream energy segment which previously held the championx business 

​ 

the downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment also in the first quarter of 2020 we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment additionally the textile care operating segment which is now being reported in other had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional  specialty reportable segment we made other immaterial changes including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments 

​ 

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

​ 

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods as part of the separation we also entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures

​ 

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

​ 

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only

​ 

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

in 2021 we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where covid19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together impacted the global recovery delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services doubledigit sales growth in the institutional  specialty and other segments along with strong industrial segment growth more than offset the healthcare  life sciences segment’s decline versus a very strong gain last year accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints including the impact of texas freeze and hurricane ida and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year

​ 

sales 

​ 

reported sales increased 8 to 127 billion in 2021 from 118 billion in 2020 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales increased 6 compared to the prior year acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5 compared to the prior year

​

​ 

balance sheet

we remain committed to maintaining “a” range ratings metrics over the longterm supported by our current credit ratings of aa3a by standard  poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch respectively our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates

​ 

net debt to ebitda 

​ 

our net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 34 and 24 for 2021 and 2020 respectively we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization see the “net debt to ebitda” table on page 44 for reconciliation information

​

​ 

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes”

​ 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

in march 2020 covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization as the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment these estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial 

information as new events occur and additional information becomes known to the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions our future financial statements could be affected 

​ 

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following

​ 

revenue recognition 

​ 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment which is over time service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided which corresponds with the transfer of control revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the lease contract

​ 

our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses 

​ 

the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach including the related deliverables the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services which most closely aligned within the operating segments in addition the accountability for the business operations as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings are performed at the operating segment level for additional information on revenue recognition refer to note 18

​ 

litigation and environmental liabilities 

​ 

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations

​ 

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position for additional information on our commitments and contingencies refer to note 16

​ 

actuarially determined liabilities 

​ 

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

​ 

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses

​ 

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table

​ 



 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased to 397 million as of december 31 2021 from 691 million as of december 31 2020 both before tax primarily due to current year net actuarial gains 

​ 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2021 on the december 31 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

 ​ 

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information

​ 

refer to note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations

​ 

selfinsurance 

​ 

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

​ 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions

​ 

effective income tax rate 

​ 

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 

​ 

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense

​ 

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

​ 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative we recognize tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results sources of future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 

​ 

uncertain tax positions 

​ 

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed examinations of our us federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions

​ 

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the consolidated balance sheets within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 25 million and 21 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively for additional information on income taxes refer to note 13

​ 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

​ 

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

​ 

longlived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in us gaap this requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows such as growth rates royalty rates or discount rates 

​ 

we review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 68 billion and 53 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 

​ 

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships

​ 

​ 

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer bases acquired from our nalco anios cid lines and purolite transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases if our customer retention rates or other postacquisition operational activities change materially we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets or absent an impairment an acceleration of amortization

​ 

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets

​ 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

​ 

we had total goodwill of 81 billion and 60 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments

​ 

for our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions including future operating performance longterm growth and discount rates our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value additionally no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented

​

the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below

​ 

 ​ 

amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

​ 

 ​ 

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown above our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales

​ 

our reported gross margin was 402 414 and 439 for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our 2021 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 939 million 482 million and 385 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the “special gains and charges” table below

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges and the impacts of the purolite transaction our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 409 compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 418 the decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints including the impact of the texas freeze and hurricane ida

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 418 and 442 for 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix which more than offset pricing

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

​ 

 ​ 

the decreased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year the decreased sga ratio comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales

​

 ​ 

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales

​ 

our reported operating income increased 15 when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints including the impact of the texas freeze and hurricane ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year our reported operating income decreased 24 when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on results which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage unfavorable business mix more than offsetting cost savings favorable pricing and higher variable compensation our reported operating income for 2021 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges and the impacts of the purolite transaction 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11 when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19 when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income

​ 

adjusted for special gains and charges and the purolite transaction the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in average debt levels and average interest rates the increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt 

​ 

provision for income taxes 

​ 

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate

​ 

 ​ 

our reported tax rate was 191 152 and 167 for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future 

​ 

we recognized net tax expense of 58 million related to discrete tax items during 2021 this included a noncash deferred tax expense of 251 million associated with transferring certain intangible property between affiliates sharebased compensation excess tax benefit was 291 million the amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises the remaining discrete tax expense of 98 million was primarily related to the filing of federal state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax law audit settlements and other changes in estimates

​ 

the change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

we issued 2800 million par value and received 2775 million in proceeds of longterm debt and repaid 900 million of longterm debt in 2021 we issued 1850 million par value and received 1856 million in proceeds of longterm debt and repaid 1570 million of longterm debt in 2020 we repaid 401 million of longterm debt in 2019 the proceeds received from the debt issuances were used for the purolite acquisition repayment of outstanding debt repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes in addition we issued 394 million of commercial paper and notes payable in 2021 and repaid 66 million and 252 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders we repurchased a total of 107 million 146 million and 354 million of shares in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

​ 

the impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments longterm debt borrowings and longterm debt repayments are shown in the following table 

​ 

  

in december 2021 we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 6 this represents the 30 th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 85 consecutive years we paid dividends of 566 million 561 million and 553 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities and as needed additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong

​ 

as of december 31 2021 we had 360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 181 million was held outside of the us as of december 31 2020 we had 1260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 59 million was held outside of the us we will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments

​ 

as of december 31 2021 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in april 2026 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our us and euro commercial paper programs the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our us commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed 20 billion at year end we had 400 million outstanding commercial paper under our us program and no commercial paper outstanding on our euro program there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2021 or 2020 as of december 31 2021 both programs were rated a2 by standard  poor’s p2 by moody’s and f1 by fitch

​ 

we had a 305 million term credit agreement which we drew on and repaid 303 million during the second quarter of 2020 the credit agreement expired in june 2020 

​ 

additionally we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions these credit lines support our daily global funding needs primarily our global cash pooling structures we have 118 million of bank supported letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments

​ 

as of december 31 2021 standard  poor’s and fitch both rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and moody’s rated our longterm credit at a3 stable outlook a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities 

 

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures

 

a schedule of our various obligations as of december 31 2021 are summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of december 31 2021 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 25 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 49 million in 2022 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles

 

​ 

market risk 

​ 

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows

 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2021 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges 

​ 

we enter into crosscurrency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2021 we had €425 million of crosscurrency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge 

​ 

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2021 we had 1250 million of interest rate swaps outstanding

 

refer to note 9 for further information on our hedging activity

 

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 278 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items

​ 

​ 

global economic and political environment 

​ 

covid19 

​ 

in march 2020 the covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization the covid19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic including supply shortages inflation and other challenges such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates while many government restrictions in the us have eased throughout 2021 restrictions on activities continue in many other regions particularly those where vaccination rates lag continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted particularly to those unvaccinated these conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world 

​ 

we expect continued if uneven global economic recovery we have also experienced continued substantial delivered product cost inflation while we expect the challenges that affected us and the rest of the world in the fourth quarter to continue into the first quarter of 2022 assuming the rate of cost inflation and covid impacts ease progressively in the second half of the year we believe our continued actions should help us deliver improved results in 2022 

​ 

global economies 

​ 

approximately half of our sales are outside of the us our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results

​ 

argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates devaluation of the argentine peso and increasing borrowing rates argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with us gaap and the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina during 2021 sales in argentina represented less than 1 of our consolidated sales assets held in argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1 of our consolidated assets

​ 

in february 2022 the us and the european union responded to russia’s invasion of ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions the us and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates while it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on ecolab any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the us or other countries or any retaliatory measures by russia in response could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations during 2021 net sales to russia and ukraine were approximately 1 of consolidated net sales

​ 

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

 

our nongaap adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes purolite sales our nongaap adjusted financial measures for cost of sales gross margin operating income other income expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special gains and charges and with the exception of other income expense the impact of the purolite transaction and our nongaap measures for tax rate net income from continuing operations attributable to ecolab and diluted eps from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items we include items within special gains and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results after tax special gains and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pretax special gains and charges

 

ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including noncontrolling interest provision for income taxes net interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda is used in our net debt to ebitda ratio which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization 

​ 

we evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange fixed currency amounts included in this form 10k are based on translation into us dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2021 we also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for international purposes

​ 

our reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the nalco merger or the impact of special gains and charges as these are not allocated to the company’s reportable segments

​ 

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods in addition as part of the separation we also entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures

​ 

these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to us gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the us gaap measures included in this mda and we have provided reconciliations of reported us gaap amounts to the nongaap amounts

​ 

general development of business 

​ 

ecolab was incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1924 our fiscal year is the calendar year ending december 31 international subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of their us gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america november 30 fiscal year ends to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in our consolidated financial reporting

​ 

on june 3 2020 the company completed the previously announced separation of its upstream energy business the “championx business” in a reverse morris trust transaction the “transaction” through the splitoff of championx holding inc “championx” formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business followed immediately by the merger the “merger” of championx with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation fka apergy corporation “apergy” 

​ 

as discussed in note 5 discontinued operations the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results therefore we are reporting the historical results of championx including the results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations and related assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified for all periods presented herein unless otherwise noted the accompanying financial information has been revised to reflect the effect of the separation of championx and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only 

​ 

subsequent to the separation of championx the company no longer reports the upstream energy segment which previously held the championx business we are aligned into three reportable segments and other 

​ 

effective in the first quarter of 2020 and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment which was also a reportable segment we eliminated the global energy reportable segment and created the downstream operating segment and the upstream operating segment which are reported in the global industrial reportable segment and newly established upstream energy reportable segment which is reported in discontinued operations respectively also in the first quarter of 2020 we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment additionally the textile care operating segment is reported in other which had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional  specialty reportable segment we made other immaterial changes including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments 

​ 

we continued to invest in and build our business through various acquisitions that complement our strategic vision see part ii item 8 note 4 of this form 10k for additional information about the acquisitions and divestitures of the company

additional information 

​ 

international operations 

​ 

we directly operate in approximately 90 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states

​ 

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations

​ 

competition 

​ 

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise innovation chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment 

​ 

the businesses in our global institutional  specialty reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation

​ 

within the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment the healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories with few globally scaled competitors life sciences business competes in the european market versus several midsize and regional competitors and competes against one large and other midsize or regional competitors in north america outside of north america and europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as ecolab our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical performance innovation chemical formulations and extensive customer support

​ 

sales 

​ 

our products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our companytrained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors and to a lesser extent sales agents are utilized in several markets as described in the segment descriptions found above

​ 

customers and classes of products 

​ 

we believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit

​ 

we sold one class of products within the global institutional  specialty reportable segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 11 13 and 13 of consolidated net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air water chemical and product regulations could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products

​ 

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

​ 

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by several states 

​ 

environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area in 2017 california passed the cleaning product right to know act of 2017 that required ingredient transparency online and onlabel by 2020 and 2021 respectively new york has proposed similar ingredient disclosure regulation the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe”“safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

​ 

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency’s “epa” capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the tsca changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below

​ 

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” which aims to manage chemical safety risks reach established a european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met all reach registration requirements to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate adopted ghsrelated legislation by 2020 the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we have met applicable deadlines and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in remaining countries eg peru chile india potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position

​ 

in europe the biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met all relevant deadlines of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances and biocide products anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position the same is true for emerging biocide regulations in asia

​ 

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

​ 

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee medical device regulation eu 2017745 and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products

​ 

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements for certain digitally connected product offerings federal communication commission “fcc” and corresponding international requirements are applicable we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​ 

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 18 million in 2020 and 32 million in 2019 approximately 33 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2021

​ 

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions we have not determined that any of these laws directly impact ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth 

​ 

furthermore climaterelated risks are assessed within our enterprise risk management process and annual business significance risks assessment which is aligned with recommendations of the financial stability board fsb task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd we report tcfd disclosures in our annual cdp climate report located at httpswwwecolabcomsustainabilitysustainabilityreportingresources we are evaluating further application of the recommendations of the tcfd over the next two to four years in alignment with the recommended timeline from the tcfd 

 

to further bolster our climate commitment in 2019 we announced new goals to reduce our ghg emissions by half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 in alignment with the united nations global compact’s business ambition for 15⁰c in 2020 we further committed to move to 100 renewable energy by 2030 and set a sciencebased target sbt addressing our scope 1 2 and 3 ghg emissions our sbt commits us to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50 by 2030 from a 2018 base year and to work with our suppliers representing 70 of our scope 3 emissions to set sciencebased reduction targets by 2024 

​ 

in addition to managing our operational and supply chain sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than three million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and ghg emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services showcasing our global team’s dedication to helping our customers thrive and make a positive impact in the world we have set a 2030 goal to help our customers reduce their ghg emissions by 45 million metric tons

​ 

ecolab recognizes the climatewater nexus as part of our 2030 impact goals we have committed to restore greater than 50 of our water withdrawal and achieve alliance for water stewardship standard certification in highrisk watersheds in addition we aim to reduce net water withdrawals by 40 per unit of production across our enterprise we also magnify our impact through the watersaving solutions we deliver to our customers and have set a goal to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

​ 

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 20 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at four sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

​ 

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 06 million in 2020 and 10 million in 2019 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2020 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 62 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​

the covid19 pandemic has had a rapid and significant negative impact on the global economy including a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries measures taken to alleviate the pandemic such as stayathome orders and other responsive measures have significantly impacted our restaurant and hospitality customers and negatively affected demand for our products and services in these segments resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations prolonged economic weakness including an extended period of elevated levels of unemployment in the key countries we serve could further reduce discretionary consumer spending and consumer confidence which could have a further adverse effect on our business and results of operations we expect the full impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of its effect on our business results of operations and financial condition to be dictated by future developments which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted such as the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the distribution and efficacy of vaccines the likelihood of a resurgence of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities intended to minimize the spread of the pandemic or to stimulate the economy and other unintended consequences in addition to the reduction in the demand for our products and services the covid19 pandemic has had and we expect will continue to have certain negative impacts on our business including but not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

​ 

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing refining pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers this year we are experiencing the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on the demand for our products and services provided to customers in the fullservice restaurant hospitality lodging and entertainment industries in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe has also negatively impacted certain of our endmarkets during these periods of weaker economic activity our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

​ 

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors 

​ 

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future for example in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar additionally the june 2016 brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies and has caused increased fluctuations and unpredictability in foreign currency exchange rates the possibility for referendum by other eu member states may lead to further market volatility other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk as a result of increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to deconsolidation across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 we devalued our venezuelan bolivar operations within various of our operating segments including water paper food  beverage and institutional similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars

​ 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

​ 

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and random attack acquisitions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data security breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption or legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business certain of our customer offerings include digital components such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations a breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential thirdparty claims and reputational damage there may be other related challenges and risks as we complete implementation of our erp system upgrade 

​ 

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

​ 

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract retain and develop a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities to drive business growth development and profitability as we continue to grow our business make acquisitions expand our geographic scope and offer new products and services we need the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for executive officer and key employee roles in order to meet the growth development and profitability goals of our business our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract retain or develop such officers or key employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels

​ 

our results could be materially and adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

​ 

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may materially and adversely affect our business

​ 

severe public health outbreaks may materially and adversely impact our business 

​ 

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic besides the covid19 pandemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business uncertainty with respect to the impact on our financial results of the covid19 pandemic is discussed further in management discussion  analysis located at part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the heading “global economic and political environment”

​ 

strategic risks 

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives including restructurings and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrades our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

we continue to execute key business initiatives including restructurings and investments to develop business systems as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we are undertaking the accelerate 2020 plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks reduce complexity and management layers consolidate facilities and focus on key long term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements as discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k additionally we are continuing implementation of our erp system upgrades which are expected to continue in phases over the next several years these upgrades which include sales supply chain and certain finance functions are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes these upgrades involve complex business process design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could materially and adversely be affected

​ 

our growth depends upon our ability to compete successfully with respect to value innovation and customer support  

​ 

we have numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high valueadded products technology and service we must also continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative profitable and high valueadded products for niche applications and commercial digital applications we have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings which are becoming an increasingly important part of our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

​ 

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2020 approximately 48 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

​ 

 ​ 

as a result of a referendum in june 2016 the uk withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 it began a transition period in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services that ended on december 31 2020 on december 24 2020 the eu and uk agreed to a trade deal with no tariffs nor quotas on products regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition since the referendum there have been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates as well as challenging market conditions in the uk given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the agreed brexit trade deal will have on our business particularly our uk and other european operations however brexit and its related effects could adversely affect our relationships with customers suppliers and employees and could have a material adverse effect our business 

​ 

in addition changes in us or foreign government policy on international trade including the imposition or continuation of tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on certain imports from china and other countries resulting in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries while the us and china signed what is being known as the phase one deal in january 2020 which included the suspension and rollback of tariffs any new tariffs imposed by the us china or other countries or any additional retaliatory measures by any of these countries could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations

​ 

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

​ 

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of us significant fines and sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

consolidation of our customers and vendors could materially and adversely affect our results 

​ 

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our pricing margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that could impact our results 

​ 

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have a material adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected  

​ 

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

legal regulatory  compliance risks 

​ 

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

​ 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws and anticorruption laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs a violation of these laws and regulations could expose us to financial liability that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows changes to labor and employment laws and regulations as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies could materially and adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability

​ 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements 

​ 

with respect to the separation and subsequent splitoff of our upstream energy business we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with championx holding inc and championx corporation fka apergy corporation and taken together with championx holding inc “championx” as well as certain other agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and our relationship with championx going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and certain other obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between championx and us if we are required to indemnify championx under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial related liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which championx has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against championx will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that championx will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our business and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

a chemical spill or release could materially and adversely impact our business  

​ 

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

​ 

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events d war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets e natural or manmade disasters f water shortages or g severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business

​ 

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement personal injury product liability wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

​ 

federal government shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by disrupting or delaying new product launches renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or export licenses for raw materials or products

​ 

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in particular the us gulf coast is a region with significant refining petrochemicals and chemicals operations which provide us raw materials as well as being an important customer base for our downstream and water operating segments hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the gulf coast could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost or at all and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region

​ 

financial risks 

​ 

if the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the divestiture are determined to be taxable in whole or in part we and our stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities 

​ 

in connection with the separation and splitoff of our upstream energy business that was consummated on june 3 2020 we obtained opinions of outside tax counsel that the related merger and exchange offer will qualify as taxfree transactions to us and our stockholders except to the extent that cash was paid to ecolab stockholders in lieu of fractional shares we have not sought or obtained a ruling from the internal revenue service irs on the tax consequences of these transactions an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts which may disagree with the opinion even if the merger and exchange offer otherwise qualified as taxfree transactions they may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either ecolab or championx corporation while championx corporation has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transactions not to qualify as taxfree transactions and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement the potential tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled if the merger or exchange offer were determined to be taxable we could be subject to a substantial tax liability and each us holder of our common stock who participated in the exchange offer could be treated as exchanging the ecolab shares surrendered for championx corporation shares in a taxable transaction

​ 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

​ 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act including but not limited to variability in our future tax rate we are also subject to changes in tax law outside the united states for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries is supporting changes to numerous longstanding tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project “beps” which is focused on a number of issues including improving tax disclosure and transparency and eliminating structures and activities that could be perceived by a particular country as resulting in tax avoidance the changes recommended by the oecd have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business some of the beps and related proposals if enacted into law in the united states and in the foreign countries where we do business could increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance the amount of taxes we incur in those jurisdictions and our global effective tax rate in addition we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws including regulations which interpret the tax act or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

​ 

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

​ 

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established

​ 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

​ 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 67 billion in outstanding indebtedness which was comprised almost entirely of fixed rate debt our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences including

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

if we add new debt the risks described above could increase

​ 

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco transaction and other acquisitions 

​ 

we expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2020 we had goodwill of 60 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco transaction if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco transaction or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

comparability of results 

​ 

championx transaction 

​ 

on june 3 2020 we completed the previously announced separation of our upstream energy business the “championx business” in a reverse morris trust transaction the “transaction” through the splitoff of championx holding inc “championx” formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business followed immediately by the merger of championx the “merger” with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation fka apergy corporation “apergy” 

​ 

the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx is a strategic shift in business that has a major effect on our operations and financial results therefore we report the historical results of championx including the results of operations cash flows and related assets and liabilities as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein unless otherwise noted the accompanying mda has been revised to reflect the championx business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only 

​ 

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

​ 

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only

​ 

comparability of reportable segments 

​ 

effective in the first quarter of 2020 and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment which was also a reportable segment subsequent to the separation of championx we will no longer report the upstream energy segment which previously held the championx business 

​ 

the downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment also in the first quarter of 2020 we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare  life sciences reportable segment this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment additionally the textile care operating segment which is now being reported in other had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional  specialty reportable segment we made other immaterial changes including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments 

​ 

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

​ 

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

in 2020 we faced significant effects from the covid19 pandemic while the greater use of cleaning and sanitizing products benefited consolidated results and led to strong growth in the healthcare  life sciences segment this was more than offset by reduced overall volumes in the institutional  specialty industrial and other segments primarily due to lower levels of global economic activity resulting from mandated government restrictions implemented to control the pandemic spread despite the range of actions we took to expand our sales and benefit our earnings through new products programs investments in the business and cost efficiency programs as well as to position us for long term growth the more substantial impact from the pandemic resulted in lower sales and a significant earnings decline for the full year 

​ 

sales 

​ 

reported sales decreased 6 to 118 billion in 2020 from 126 billion in 2019 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales decreased 5 compared to the prior year acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales decreased 7 compared to the prior year

​ 

gross margin

reported operating income decreased 24 to 14 billion in 2020 compared to 18 billion in 2019 adjusted operating income excluding the impact of special gains and charges decreased 19 in 2020 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 18 in 2020 

​ 

earnings from continuing operations attributable to ecolab per common share “eps” 

​ 

reported continuing operations diluted eps decreased 32 to 333 in 2020 compared to 487 in 2019 special gains and charges had an impact on both years special gains and charges in 2020 were driven primarily by the impact of debt refinancing charges restructuring charges disposal and impairment charges discrete tax items acquisition and integration charges charges for pay protection for certain employees impacted by covid19 net of government subsidies and litigation and other charges special gains and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges discrete tax items acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges special gains and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation adjusted continuing operations diluted eps which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items decreased 21 to 402 in 2020 compared to 512 in 2019 

​

our net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 24 and 23 for 2020 and 2019 respectively we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization see the “net debt to ebitda” table on page 45 for reconciliation information

​ 

cash flow 

​ 

cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was 17 billion in 2020 compared to 20 billion in 2019 we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in our business debt repayments pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments 

​ 

dividends 

​ 

we increased our quarterly cash dividend 2 in december 2020 bringing annual dividends declared to 189 per share the increase represents our 29th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 84th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development strong cash flows solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes”

​ 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

in march 2020 coronavirus 2019 “covid19” was declared a pandemic “pandemic” by the world health organization as the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment these estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial information as new events occur and additional information becomes known to the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions our future financial statements could be affected 

​ 

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following

​ 

revenue recognition 

​ 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment which is over time service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided which corresponds with the transfer of control revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the lease contract

​ 

our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see discussion below

​ 

the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach including the related deliverables the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services which most closely aligned within the operating segments in addition the accountability for the business operations as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings are performed at the operating segment level for additional information on revenue recognition see note 18

​ 

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

​ 

allowances for doubtful accounts 

​ 

accounts receivable are carried at the invoiced amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and generally do not bear interest our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our expectations of expected credit losses and is determined by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates our estimates separately consider macroeconomic trends and specific circumstances and credit conditions of customer receivables account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered 

​ 

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 84 million and 56 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 16 million and 17 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 05 02 and 01 in 2020 2019 and 2018 our 2020 bad debt expense reflects a slight deterioration in the collectability of our credit portfolio due to the covid19 pandemic we believe that the covid19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on future results consistent with 2020 experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2

​ 

accrued liabilities 

​ 

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations

​ 

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 16

​ 

actuarially determined liabilities 

​ 

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

​ 

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses

​ 

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans increased to 691 million as of december 31 2020 from 632 million as of december 31 2019 both before tax primarily due to current year net actuarial losses 

​ 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2020 on the december 31 2020 defined benefit obligation and 2021 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

 ​ 

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information

​ 

see note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations

​ 

selfinsurance 

​ 

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

​ 

restructuring 

​ 

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which typically is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets

 

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet our restructuring liability balance was 102 million and 103 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for additional information on our restructuring activities see note 3

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions

​ 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted which reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income “gilti” the base erosion anti abuse tax “beat” and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income “fdii” we have elected the period cost method and included the gilti impact in our tax expense

​ 

we recorded updates to the estimated discrete tax expense benefit of the onetime transition tax in 2018 and 2019 of 66 million and 31 million respectively primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 us federal tax returns and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax we have completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax

​ 

effective income tax rate 

​ 

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 

​ 

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense

​ 

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

​ 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative we recognize tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results sources of future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 

​ 

uncertain tax positions 

​ 

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our us federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions

​ 

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 21 million and 27 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for additional information on income taxes see note 13

​ 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

​ 

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

​ 

we review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 53 billion and 54 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 

​ 

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships

​ 

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer bases acquired from our nalco anios and cid lines transactions which made up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases if our customer retention rates or other postacquisition operational activities change materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets or absent an impairment an acceleration of amortization

​ 

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets

​ 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

​ 

we had total goodwill of 60 billion and 56 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments

​ 

for our annual 2020 goodwill impairment assessment we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates terminal values and discount rates our goodwill impairment assessments for 2020 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the respective carrying amount of the reporting unit by a significant margin we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may not be recoverable additionally no events noted during the second half of 2020 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2020 for any of our eleven reporting units there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented

​ 

the nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset during the second quarter of 2020 we completed our annual impairment assessment of the nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections royalty rates and discount rates based on this testing the estimated fair value of the nalco trade name exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin therefore no adjustment to the 12 billion carrying value of this asset was necessary there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired 

​ 

assets held for sale 

​ 

assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately on the balance sheet when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met 1 management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the assets 2 the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets 3 an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated 4 the sale of the assets is probable and is expected to be completed within one year 5 the assets are being actively marketed for a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value and 6 actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn the championx business met the criteria to be held for sale immediately prior to the separation the championx business was previously recorded in the global energy reportable segment which became the upstream energy reportable segment beginning in 2020 and subsequently has been reported in discontinued operations the assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current assets of discontinued operations longterm assets of discontinued operations current liabilities of discontinued operations and longterm liabilities of discontinued operations respectively

​ 

​ 

discontinued operations 

​ 

discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of a period and represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because it was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results the championx business is presented on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income as discontinued operations refer to note 5 discontinued operations for additional information

​ 

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

net sales 

​ 

 ​ 

the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below

​ 

 ​ 

amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding

​ 

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

​ 

 ​ 

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown above our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales

​ 

our reported gross margin was 414 439 and 437 for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our 2020 2019 and 2018 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 482 million 385 million and 48 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the “special gains and charges” table on page 35

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2020 adjusted gross margin was 418 compared against a 2019 adjusted gross margin of 442 the decrease primarily reflected the impact of lower volume reduced operating leverage and unfavorable business mix which more than offset pricing

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 442 and 438 for 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was driven primarily by pricing which more than offset unfavorable sales mix

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

​ 

 ​ 

the decreased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales the decreased sga ratio comparing 2019 against 2018 was driven primarily by sales leverage restructuring efforts and cost savings which more than offset investments in the business

​ 

special gains and charges 

​ 

special gains and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items

 ​ 

for segment reporting purposes special gains and charges are not allocated to reportable segments which is consistent with our internal management reporting

​ 

accelerate 2020 

​ 

during 2018 we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 “the plan” to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes the goal of the plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks reduce complexity and management layers consolidated facilitates and focus on key longterm growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements in the third quarter of 2020 we expanded the plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements following the establishment of the separate institutional plan we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022 with total anticipated costs of 255 million 195 million after tax or 067 per diluted share over this period of time when revised for continuing operations costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales

​ 

our reported operating income decreased 24 when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on results which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage unfavorable business mix more than offsetting cost savings favorable pricing and lower variable compensation our reported operating income increased 7 when comparing 2019 to 2018 primarily driven by pricing and cost savings which more than offset investments in the business our reported operating income for 2020 2019 and 2018 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19 when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income and 2019 adjusted operating income increased 9 when compared to 2018 adjusted operating income

​ 

interest expense net 

​ 

 ​ 

our reported net interest expense totaled 2902 million 1907 million and 2211 million during 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

we incurred 838 million 646 million after tax or 022 per diluted share 02 million 01 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share and 03 million 02 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share of interest expense in conjunction with our debt refinancing and acquisitions during 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

the increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt the decrease in our 2019 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2018 was driven primarily by lower outstanding debt and higher interest income 

​ 

provision for income taxes 

​ 

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate

​ 

 ​ 

our reported tax rate was 152 167 and 202 for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future 

​ 

we recognized a total net benefit related to discrete tax items of 558 million during 2020 the tax benefit related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 573 million the amount of this tax benefit is subject to variation in stock price and award exercises we recorded changes in reserves in nonus and us jurisdictions due to audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitations which resulted in a 98 million tax benefit additionally we recognized a net tax expense of 113 million primarily related to the filing of the prior year federal state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments 

​ 

​ 

we recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of 577 million during 2019 sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 423 million in 2019 we recognized 156 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law which primarily includes 304 million benefit due to the passage of the swiss tax reform and ahv financing act a swiss federal tax law offset by a tax expense of 102 million due to the release of the final treasury regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends we recorded changes in reserves in nonus and us jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a 138 million tax benefit we finalized the 2015 and 2016 irs audit which also resulted in discrete tax expense of 110 million the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in nonus jurisdictions

​ 

we recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of 21 million during 2018 we filed us federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of 399 million related to changes in estimates and an irs approved method change the tax act resulted in 660 million expense for 2018 related to updates to the onetime transition tax primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance and finalization of estimates sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 277 million in 2018 included within the 2018 provision for income taxes is 380 million of discrete charges to correct immaterial errors in prior years the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in nonus jurisdictions audit settlements and both international and us changes in estimates

​ 

the change in our adjusted tax rates from 2018 to 2020 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

financial position 

​ 

total assets were 181 billion as of december 31 2020 compared to total assets of 209 billion as of december 31 2019

 

total liabilities were 119 billion as of december 31 2020 compared to total liabilities of 121 billion as of december 31 2019 total debt was 67 billion as of december 31 2020 and 64 billion as of december 31 2019 see further discussion of our debt activity within the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda

 

our net debt to ebitda is shown in the following table ebitda is a nongaap measure discussed further in the “nongaap financial measures” section of this mda

​ 

 ​ 

cash flows 

​ 

operating activities 

​ 

 ​ 

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations amidst the covid19 pandemic allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases

​ 

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2020 to 2018 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable “working capital” the combination of which increased 32 million 128 million and 133 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the 2020 cash flow impact from working capital accounts was driven by lower sales volume partially offset by lower inventory turnover and slower accounts receivable collection 

​ 

the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions cash activity related to restructuring cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table 

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

investing activities 

​ 

 ​ 

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business

​ 

total cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions in 2020 2019 and 2018 was 371 million 385 million and 221 million respectively our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in note 4 we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our longterm growth

 

we continue to make capital investments in the business including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities total capital expenditures were 489 million 731 million and 779 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

financing activities 

​ 

 ​ 

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt common stock repurchases proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs dividend payments and acquisitionrelated contingent considerations

​ 

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders we repurchased a total of 146 million 354 million and 562 million of shares in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

​ 

the impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments longterm debt borrowings and longterm debt repayments are shown in the following table 

​ 

  

in december 2020 we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 2 this represents the 29 th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 84 consecutive years cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash on hand cash generated from operating activities and as needed additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong

​ 

as of december 31 2020 we had 1260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 59 million was held outside of the us as of december 31 2019 we had 119 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 91 million was held outside of the us we have increased our available cash on hand during the year to meet current and any future potential operational cash needs as a result of covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments

​ 

as of december 31 2020 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in november 2022 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our us and euro commercial paper programs the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our us commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed 20 billion at year end we had no outstanding commercial paper under our euro or us program there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2020 or 2019 as of december 31 2020 both programs were rated a2 by standard  poor’s p2 by moody’s and f1 by fitch

​ 

as of december 31 2020 we have a 500 million 364day revolving credit agreement which expires in april 2021 the revolving credit agreement is to be used for general corporate purposes with a diverse syndicate of banks to provide for further liquidity in response to the coronavirus pandemic there were no borrowings under this revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2020 in addition we executed a 305 million term credit agreement in april 2020 which we drew on and repaid 303 million during the second quarter of 2020 

​ 

additionally we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions these credit lines support our daily global funding needs primarily our global cash pooling structures we have 123 million of bank supported letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments

​ 

as of december 31 2020 standard  poor’s and fitch both rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and moody’s rated our longterm credit at baa1 positive outlook a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities 

 

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures

 

a schedule of our various obligations as of december 31 2020 are summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of december 31 2020 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 21 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 47 million in 2020 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

​ 

we do not participate in offbalance sheet financing arrangements through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control nor are the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

​ 

market risk 

​ 

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows

 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2020 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges

 

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2020 we had no interest rate swaps outstanding

 

see note 9 for further information on our hedging activity

 

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 213 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items

​ 

global economic and political environment 

​ 

coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 

​ 

in march 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization the covid19 pandemic affected global economies and financial markets throughout 2020 and industries faced challenges from restricted economic conditions resulting from government and private efforts to address the pandemic as the pandemic continued and new variants of covid19 were identified most countries required companies to limit or suspend business operations and implemented travel restrictions these conditions had and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world over the foreseeable future until the pandemic diminishes we experienced and anticipate continued overall adverse impacts and disruptions in our restaurant hospitality and entertainmentrelated business operations with modest impact on our industrial segment businesses and limited or no adverse impacts on certain other parts of our business supply chain and business continuity plans from covid19 restrictions in addition certain of our business have and will continue to benefit from increased cleaning and sanitizing product demand

​ 

while we anticipate our 2021 results of operations to be generally comparable to 2019 we are not yet able to adequately estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our end markets and our business due to the pandemic’s evolving nature and the public and private responses to it while we expect favorable conditions to resume in our industrial markets and expect conditions to continue to be favorable in our healthcare and life sciences markets we anticipate products and services provided to the fullservice restaurant hospitality lodging and entertainment industries will continue to be negatively impacted over the near term due to the regulatory and organizational operating restrictions and mandates that have been put in place and affecting those end markets we have taken and are continuing to take steps to drive revenue growth through new products programs and markets as well as steps to reduce costs including reductions in capital expenditures as well as other ongoing cost initiatives 

​ 

the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into law on march 27 2020 we have taken advantage of the employer payroll tax fica deferral offered by the cares act which allowed us to defer the payment of employer payroll taxes for the period from march 27 2020 to december 31 2020 the deferred fica liability was 664 million and will be payable in equal installments at december 2021 and december 2022

​ 

global economies 

​ 

almost half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results

​ 

argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates devaluation of the argentine peso and increasing borrowing rates argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with us gaap and the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina during 2020 sales in argentina represented less than 1 of our consolidated sales assets held in argentina at the end of 2020 represented less than 1 of our consolidated assets

additional information 

​ 

international operations 

​ 

we directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states

​ 

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations

​ 

​ 

competition 

​ 

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise innovation chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment 

​ 

the businesses in our global institutional reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation

over time we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements to achieve quicker operational scale to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers during 2019 the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures in the aggregate was approximately three percent the table below identifies our most significant consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture

​ 

 ​ 

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach

​ 

environmental and regulatory considerations 

​ 

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

​ 

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

​ 

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina 

​ 

environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area in 2017 california passed the cleaning product right to know act of 2017 that will require ingredient transparency online and onlabel by 2020 and 2021 respectively new york has published ingredient disclosure guidance based on existing regulation but final compliance has been delayed due to litigation the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe”“safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

​ 

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency’s “epa” capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the tsca changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below

​ 

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach and the 2010 2013 and 2018 registration deadlines to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation by 2020 and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we met the 2015 deadlines in the us and european union and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in remaining countries eg peru chile india potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position

​ 

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position

​ 

in europe the biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position the same is true for emerging biocide regulations in asia

​ 

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

​ 

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee medical device regulation and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products

​ 

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​ 

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 54 million in 2019 and 60 million in 2018 approximately 56 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2020

​ 

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth 

 

furthermore climaterelated risks are assessed within our enterprise risk management process and annual business significance risks assessment which is aligned with recommendations of the financial stability board fsb task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd we report tcfd disclosures in our annual carbon disclosure project climate report located at httpswwwecolabcomsustainabilitydownloadsustainabilityreports we are evaluating further application of the recommendations of the tcfd over the next three to five years in alignment with the recommended timeline from the tcfd 

​ 

to further bolster our climate commitment in december 2019 we announced new goals to reduce carbon emissions in half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 and move to 100 renewable energy with positive implications for longterm risk management we made these commitments as a part of aligning with the united nations global compact’s business ambition for 15⁰c

​ 

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2016 they include a 25 percent reduction in water withdrawals and a 10 percent reduction in ghg emissions by 2020 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than three million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and ghg emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services we also introduced a customer impact goal for the first time by partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our solutions we aim to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

​ 

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 27 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

​ 

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance

​ 

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 2 million in 2019 and 3 million in 2018 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2019 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 16 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors  

​ 

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above 

​ 

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

​ 

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

​ 

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the well completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices in 2015 and 2016 the global energy segment experienced decreased sales as a result of very challenging global energy market conditions in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe has also negatively impacted certain of our endmarkets during these periods of weaker economic activity our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

​ 

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors 

​ 

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future for example in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar additionally the june 2016 brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies and has caused increased fluctuations and unpredictability in foreign currency exchange rates the possibility for referendum by other eu member states may lead to further market volatility other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk as a result of increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to deconsolidation across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 we devalued our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives including restructurings and our enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrades our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

we continue to execute key business initiatives including restructurings and investments to develop business systems as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we are undertaking the accelerate 2020 plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks reduce complexity and management layers consolidate facilities and focus on key longterm growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements as discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k additionally we are continuing our implementation of our erp system upgrades which are expected to occur in phases over the next several years these upgrades which include supply chain and certain finance functions are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes these upgrades involve complex business process design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption we are also making changes to our system in order to support our separation of the championx business if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could materially and adversely be affected

​ 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

​ 

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and random attack acquisitions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data security breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption or legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets or sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business certain of our customer offerings include digital components such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations a breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential thirdparty claims and reputational damage there may be other related challenges and risks as we complete implementation of our erp system upgrade 

​ 

we are pursuing a plan to separate and combine our upstream energy business with apergy corporation in a taxefficient reverse morris trust transaction the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

​ 

we have entered into definitive agreements with championx and apergy pursuant to which we will separate the upstream energy business of our global energy segment and combine it with apergy in a taxefficient reverse morris trust transaction there can be no assurance of the timing of a transaction with apergy or whether any such transaction will take place at all the transaction is subject to closing conditions including approval by apergy’s stockholders approval by certain foreign regulatory authorities and receipt of opinions with respect to the taxfree nature of the proposed transaction and there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals in a timely manner or at all or that such approvals will not contain adverse conditions we also have no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits and tax treatment of the transaction or that the new combined company will perform as expected the announcement and pendency of the transaction could also cause disruptions in our and apergy’s business including potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships and competitive responses to the transaction the transaction will also require significant amounts of time and effort which could divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business in addition depending on apergy’s stock price at the closing of the transaction the transaction may result in a book gain or loss to ecolab any such book gain or loss would be reported in ecolab’s financial statements as discontinued operations any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

​ 

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract retain and develop a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities to drive business growth development and profitability as we continue to grow our business make acquisitions expand our geographic scope and offer new products and services we need the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for executive officer and key employee roles in order to meet the growth development and profitability goals of our business our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract retain or develop such officers or key employees

​ 

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  

​ 

we have numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high valueadded products technology and service we must also continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative profitable and high valueadded products for niche applications and commercial digital applications we have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings which are becoming an increasingly important part of our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

​ 

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2019 approximately 46 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

​ 

 ​ 

effective january 31 2020 the uk has formally left the european union the uk’s relationship with the eu will no longer be governed by the eu treaties but instead by the terms of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the uk and the eu in late 2019 the withdrawal agreement provides for a “transition” period which commenced the moment the uk left the eu and is currently set to end on december 31 2020 at the end of the transition period there may be significant changes to the uk’s business environment while the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets or the failure to reach such agreements the uncertainties created by brexit any resolution between the uk and eu countries or the failure to reach any such resolutions could adversely affect our relationships with customers suppliers and employees and could have a material adverse effect our business 

​ 

in addition changes in us or foreign government policy on international trade including the imposition or continuation of tariffs could materially and adversely affect our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on certain imports from china and other countries resulting in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries while the us and china signed what is being known as the phase one deal in january 2020 which included the suspension and rollback of tariffs any new tariffs imposed by the us china or other countries or any additional retaliatory measures by any of these countries could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations

​ 

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

​ 

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

our results could be materially and adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

​ 

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may materially and adversely affect our business

​ 

consolidation of our customers and vendors could materially and adversely affect our results 

​ 

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our pricing margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

​ 

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows changes to labor and employment laws and regulations as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies could materially and adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability

​ 

subsidiaries of championx are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of corexit tm dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose these subsidiaries to monetary damages or settlement costs 

​ 

as described in part ii item 8 note 15 “commitments and contingencies” of this form 10k certain entities that are or will become subsidiaries of championx upon completion of the transactions to separate and combine our upstream energy business with apergy corporation collectively the “corexit defendants” are among the defendants in a number of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from the use of corexit™ dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose the corexit defendants to monetary damages or settlement costs the plaintiffs in these matters have claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories

​ 

there currently remain three cases pending against the corexit defendants it is expected that they will be dismissed pursuant to a november 28 2012 order granting the corexit defendants’ motion for summary judgment championx cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement the corexit defendants might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however although championx believes it has rights to contribution andor indemnification from third parties in connection with these lawsuits if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have a material adverse effect on the business of championx and its financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

the corexit defendants continue to sell the corexit™ oil dispersant product and previously sold product remains in the inventories of individual customers and oil spill response organizations championx cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales or inventory however if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won these suits could have a material adverse impact on the combined company’s financial results

​ 

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that could impact our results 

​ 

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have a material adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations

​ 

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected  

​ 

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

​ 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act including but not limited to variability in our future tax rate we are also subject to changes in tax law outside the united states in addition we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws including regulations which interpret the tax act or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results

​ 

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

​ 

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established

​ 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 63 billion in outstanding indebtedness with approximately 80 million in the form of floating rate debt our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences including

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

if we add new debt the risks described above could increase

​ 

severe public health outbreaks may materially and adversely impact our business 

​ 

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as coronavirus zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business uncertainty with respect to the impact on our financial results of the coronavirus outbreak is discussed further in management discussion  analysis located at part ii item 7 of this form 10k under the heading “global economic and political environment”

​ 

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions 

​ 

we expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2019 we had goodwill of 73 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from t h e nal c o a n d ch ampi o n tr an sa c t i o n s  if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

​ 

a chemical spill or release could materially and adversely impact our business  

​ 

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

​ 

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

​ 

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events d war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets e natural or manmade disasters f water shortages or g severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business

​ 

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement personal injury product liability wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

​

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the following management discussion and analysis “mda” provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results cash flows and financial condition we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level we also provide quantitative information regarding special gains and charges discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance

​ 

the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap this discussion contains various nongaap financial measures and also contains various forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “nongaap financial measures” at the end of this mda and “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” within items 1 and 1a of this form 10k we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “results of operations” of this mda for reconciliation information of nongaap measures to us gaap

​ 

comparability of results 

​ 

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

​ 

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only

​ 

comparability of reportable segments 

​ 

we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments all comparisons and discussion throughout the mda reflect these changes

​ 

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

​ 

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

we achieved improved sales and strong earnings growth in 2019 as we drove new product introductions new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally steady market environment increased pricing was achieved to more than offset unfavorable sales mix along with higher other income and lower interest expense adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth and delivered the year’s doubledigit adjusted diluted eps growth 

​ 

sales 

​ 

reported sales increased 2 to 149 billion in 2019 from 147 billion in 2018 sales were positively impacted by pricing when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales increased 4 compared to the prior year acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 3 compared to the prior year

​ 

gross margin 

​ 

our reported gross margin was 415 of sales for 2019 compared to our 2018 reported gross margin of 412 excluding the impact of special gains and charges included in cost of sales from both 2019 and 2018 our adjusted gross margin was 417 in 2019 and 413 in 2018 

​ 

operating income 

​ 

reported operating income increased 3 to 201 billion in 2019 compared to 195 billion in 2018 adjusted operating income excluding the impact of special gains and charges increased 9 in 2019 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 11 in 2019 

​ 

earnings attributable to ecolab per common share “eps” 

​ 

reported diluted eps increased 9 to 533 in 2019 compared to 488 in 2018 special gains and charges had an impact on both years special gains and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges the championx separation charges discrete tax items acquisition and integration charges litigation and other charges special gains and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation special gains and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform restructuring charges other discrete taxes acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of equipment care adjusted diluted eps which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items increased 11 to 582 in 2019 compared to 525 in 2018 

​ 

balance sheet 

​ 

we remain committed to maintaining “a” range ratings metrics supported by our current credit ratings of abaa1a by standard  poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates

​ 

net debt to ebitda 

​ 

our net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 20 and 23 for 2019 and 2018 respectively we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization see the “net debt to ebitda” table on page 43 for reconciliation information

​ 

cash flow 

​ 

cash flow from operating activities was 24 billion in 2019 compared to 23 billion in 2018 we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in our business debt repayments pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments 

​ 

dividends 

​ 

we increased our quarterly cash dividend 2 in december 2019 to an indicated annual rate of 188 per share the increase represents our 28th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 83rd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development strong cash flows solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes”

​ 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following

​ 

revenue recognition 

​ 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment which is over time service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided which corresponds with the transfer of control revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the lease contract

​ 

our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see discussion below

​ 

the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach including the related deliverables the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services which most closely aligned within the operating segments in addition the accountability for the business operations as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings are performed at the operating segment level for additional information on revenue recognition see note 17

​ 

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

​ 

allowances for doubtful accounts 

​ 

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates in addition our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits actual results could differ from these estimates

​ 

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 62 million and 61 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 18 million and 17 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 01 in each of the years 2019 2018 and 2017 we believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2

​ 

accrued liabilities 

​ 

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations

​ 

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 15

​ 

actuarially determined liabilities 

​ 

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

​ 

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses

​ 

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans increased to 632 million as of december 31 2019 from 539 million as of december 31 2018 both before tax primarily due to current year net actuarial losses 

​ 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2019 on the december 31 2019 defined benefit obligation and 2020 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period

​ 

 ​ 

​ 

 ​ 

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information

​ 

see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations

​ 

selfinsurance 

​ 

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

​ 

restructuring 

​ 

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which typically is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets

 

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet our restructuring liability balance was 112 million and 79 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively for additional information on our restructuring activities see note 3

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions

​ 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted which reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the base erosion anti abuse tax beat and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii 

​ 

we recorded an estimate of the onetime transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 160 million and in 2018 and 2019 we recorded additional discrete expense of 66 million and benefit of 31 million respectively primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 us federal tax return and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax we have completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax

​ 

additionally proposed regulations were released during 2019 certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge therefore we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the tax act and not the proposed regulations if the proposed regulations become final we will record the impact at that time

​ 

effective income tax rate 

​ 

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances this expected annual rate is then applied to our yeartodate operating results in the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period

​ 

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense

​ 

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

​ 

temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements

​ 

during 2019 due to the adoption of the new lease standard and the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we recorded related deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets respectively 

​ 

uncertain tax positions 

​ 

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our us federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions

​ 

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 28 million and 50 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively for additional information on income taxes see note 12

​ 

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

​ 

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

​ 

we review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 70 billion and 71 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value 

​ 

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships

​ 

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer bases acquired from our nalco and champion transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base if our customer retention rate or other postacquisition operational activities changed materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets

​ 

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets

​ 

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

​ 

we had total goodwill of 73 billion and 71 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments

​ 

for our 2019 impairment assessment we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our reporting units using a twostep quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow approach the first step of the analysis involved determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and comparing them to the respective carrying values including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any our goodwill impairment assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented

​ 

as part of the nalco merger we added the “nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset the total value of which was 12 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing using a relief from royalty assessment method during the second quarter of 2019 our nalco trade name assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin we assess the need to test the nalco trade name for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name in any of the years presented

results of operations 

​ 

net sales 

​ 

 ​ 

the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below

​ 

 ​ 

amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding

​ 

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

​ 

 ​ 

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales

​ 

our reported gross margin was 415 412 and 417 for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively our 2019 2018 and 2017 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 385 million 93 million and 440 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the “special gains and charges” table on page 33

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2019 adjusted gross margin was 417 compared against a 2018 adjusted gross margin of 413 the increase was driven primarily by pricing which more than offset unfavorable sales mix

​ 

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 413 and 420 for 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs more than offsetting the impact from increased pricing and cost savings

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

​ 

 ​ 

the decreased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2019 against 2018 and comparing 2018 against 2017 were driven primarily by sales leverage restructuring efforts and cost savings which more than offset investments in the business

​ 

special gains and charges 

​ 

special gains and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items

 ​ 

for segment reporting purposes special gains and charges are not allocated to reportable segments which is consistent with our internal management reporting

​ 

restructuring activities 

​ 

restructuring activities are primarily related to accelerate 2020 described below these activities have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and other income expense on the consolidated statement of income restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

​ 

further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3

​ 

accelerate 2020 

​ 

during the third quarter of 2018 we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 “the plan” to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes in 2019 we raised our goals for the plan to further simplify and automate processes and tasks reduce complexity and management layers consolidated facilitates and focus on key longterm growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements we expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020 with total anticipated costs of 260 million 200 million after tax or an estimated 068 per diluted share over this period of time costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken 

​ 

we recorded restructuring charges of 1366 million 1044 million after tax or 036 per diluted share in 2019 of these expenses 20 million 15 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share is recorded in other income expense the liability related to the plan was 1040 million as of the end of the year we have recorded 2412 million 1840 million after tax or 063 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the plan the majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities

​ 

the plan has delivered 125 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of 325 million by 2021 

​ 

​ 

other restructuring activities 

​ 

during 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 41 million 33 million after tax or 001 per diluted share related to an immaterial restructuring plan the charges are comprised of severance facility closure costs including asset disposals and consulting fees 

​ 

prior to 2018 we engaged in a number of restructuring plans during 2017 we commenced restructuring and other costsaving actions in order to streamline operations these actions include a reduction of our global workforce as well as asset disposals and lease terminations actions were substantially completed in 2017 we also have restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2016 during 2019 net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were 15 million 11 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share during 2018 net restructuring gains related to prior year plans were 31 million 24 million after tax or 001 per diluted share the gains recorded were due to finalizing estimates upon completion of projects during 2017 we recorded restructuring charges of 445 million 323 million after tax or 011 per diluted share 

​ 

the restructuring liability balance for all plans excluding accelerate 2020 was 77 million and 149 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments the remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities cash payments during 2019 related to these plans were 83 million

​ 

operating income and operating income margin 

 ​ 

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales

​ 

our reported operating income increased 3 when comparing 2019 to 2018 and was flat when comparing 2018 to 2017 our reported operating income for 2019 2018 and 2017 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2019 adjusted operating income increased 9 when compared to 2018 adjusted operating income and 2018 adjusted operating income increased 5 when compared to 2017 adjusted operating income 

​ 

as shown in the previous table foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2019 and 2018 

​ 

​ 

other income expense 

​ 

 ​ 

our reported other income was 763 million 799 million and 673 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively excluding the impact of pension curtailments and settlements in 2019 our adjusted other income was 858 million reflecting the return on pension assets and nonservice costs of our pension obligations

​ 

the decrease in our 2019 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2018 was driven primarily by lower outstanding debt and higher interest income the decrease in our 2018 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2017 was driven primarily by lower interest rates on debt 

​ 

provision for income taxes 

​ 

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate

​ 

 ​ 

our reported tax rate was 170 202 and 138 for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future the enactment of the tax act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate

​ 

we recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of 584 million during 2019 sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 431 million in 2019 the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises we recognized 156 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law which primarily includes 304 million benefit due to the passage of the swiss tax reform and ahv financing act a swiss federal tax law offset by a tax expense of 102 million due to the release of the final treasury regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends we recorded changes in reserves in nonus and us jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a 168 million tax benefit we finalized the 2015 and 2016 irs audit which also resulted in discrete tax expense of 110 million the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in nonus jurisdictions

​ 

we recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of 47 million during 2018 in the third quarter of 2018 we filed us federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of 399 million related to changes in estimates and an irs approved method change us tax reform as described further below resulted in 660 million expense for 2018 sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 281 million in 2018 the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises included within the 2018 provision for income taxes in 442 million of discrete charges recorded in the fourth quarter to correct immaterial errors in prior years the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in nonus jurisdictions audit settlements and both international and us changes in estimates

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted which reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the base erosion anti abuse tax beat and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii in january 2018 accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of our deferred taxes the deferred method we have elected the period cost method and included the gilti impact in our tax expense

​ 

we initially recorded an estimate of the onetime transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 1601 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of 660 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the tax act primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits our 2017 reported rate also includes a 3190 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the us enacted tax rate of 21 our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special gains and charges as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of us tax reform of 78 million during 2017 we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of 397 million related to excess tax benefits in addition we recorded net discrete expenses of 144 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 us federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters 

​ 

the adjusted rate was 203 for both 2019 and 2018 the change in our adjusted tax rate from 2018 to 2017 was primarily driven by enactment of the tax act global tax planning projects and geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to the tax act other changes in global tax rules further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

our net debt to ebitda is shown in the following table ebitda is a nongaap measure discussed further in the “nongaap financial measures” section of this mda

​ 

 ​ 

cash flows 

​ 

operating activities 

​ 

 ​ 

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases

​ 

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2019 to 2017 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable “working capital” the combination of which increased 74 million 192 million and 56 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections timing of purchases and production and usage levels and volume of purchases and timing of payments 

​ 

the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions cash activity related to restructuring cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table 

​ 

 ​ 

investing activities 

​ 

 ​ 

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business

​ 

total cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions in 2019 2018 and 2017 was 385 million 221 million and 870 million respectively our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in note 4 we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our longterm growth

 

we continue to make capital investments in the business including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities total capital expenditures were 801 million 847 million and 869 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

​ 

financing activities 

​ 

 ​ 

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt common stock repurchases proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs dividend payments and acquisitionrelated contingent considerations

​ 

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders we repurchased a total of 354 million 562 million and 600 million of shares in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 2017 amount includes 300 million of shares repurchased through an accelerated stock repurchase “asr” agreement see note 10 for further information regarding the asr agreement

​ 

the impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments longterm debt borrowings and longterm debt repayments are shown in the following table 

​ 

  

in december 2019 we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 2 this represents the 28 th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 83 consecutive years cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows

​ 

 ​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities and as needed additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong

​ 

as of december 31 2019 we had 186 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 159 million was held outside of the us as of december 31 2018 we had 115 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand substantially all of which was held outside of the us 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in november 2022 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our us and euro commercial paper programs the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our us commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed 20 billion at yearend we had 551 million €500 million of commercial paper outstanding under the euro commercial paper program and no borrowings under the us commercial paper program there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2019 or 2018 as of december 31 2019 both programs were rated a2 by standard  poor’s p2 by moody’s and f1 by fitch

​ 

additionally we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions these credit lines support our daily global funding needs primarily our global cash pooling structures we have 165 million of bank supported letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments

​ 

as of december 31 2019 standard  poor’s and fitch both rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and moody’s rated our longterm credit at baa1 positive outlook a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities 

 

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures

 

a schedule of our various obligations as of december 31 2019 are summarized in the following table

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

as of december 31 2019 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 28 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 46 million in 2020 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

 

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

​ 

we do not participate in offbalance sheet financing arrangements operating leases were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 2018 or 2017 through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control nor are the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

​ 

market risk 

​ 

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows

 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2019 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges

 

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2019 we had no interest rate swaps outstanding

 

see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity

 

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 257 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items

​ 

global economic and political environment 

​ 

energy markets 

 

approximately 22 of our sales are generated from our global energy segment the results of which are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets during 2019 the north american oil industry drilling and production activity slowed from 2018 levels while international activity showed modest improvement demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016 

​ 

our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to perform well in the current market as such we continue to remain confident in the longterm growth prospects of the segment

​ 

global economies 

​ 

almost half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results

​ 

argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates devaluation of the argentine peso and increasing borrowing rates argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with us gaap and the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina during 2019 sales in argentina represented less than 1 of our consolidated sales assets held in argentina at the end of 2019 represented less than 1 of our consolidated assets

 

the coronavirus has had a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand starting in china we anticipate an impact to our 2020 sales from lower market demand but we are not yet able to estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak as it continues to spread beyond china

​ 

brexit referendum 

​ 

effective on january 31 2020 the uk has formally left the european union the uk’s relationship with the eu will no longer be governed by the eu treaties but instead by the terms of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the uk and the eu in late 2019 the withdrawal agreement provides for a “transition” period which commenced the moment the uk leaves the eu and is currently set to end on december 31 2020 at the end of the transition period there may be significant changes to the uk’s business environment while the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets or the failure to reach such agreements the uncertainties created by brexit any resolution between the uk and eu countries or the failure to reach any such resolutions could adversely affect our relationships with customers suppliers and employees and could adversely affect our business 

​ 

during 2019 net sales of our uk operations were approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales

additional information 

  

international operations   

  

we directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

  

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competition 

  

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our global energy reportable segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product quality technical expertise chemical formulations effective global supply chain strong customer service and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership 

  

sales 

  

products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors and to a lesser extent sales agents are utilized in several markets as described in the segment descriptions found above 

  

number of employees 

  

we had 49000 employees as of december 31 2018 

  

 

customers and classes of products 

  

we believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2018 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit 

  

we sold one class of products within the global institutional reportable segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 11 of consolidated net sales in 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement except for the items listed below we do not believe our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

our research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of those already existing improving service program content evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel 

  

we believe continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

  

joint ventures 

  

over time we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements to achieve quicker operational scale to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers during 2018 the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures in the aggregate was less than three percent the table below identifies our most significant consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture 

  



  

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

 

environmental and regulatory considerations 

  

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean‑up fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina 

environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area in 2017 california passed the cleaning product right to know act of 2017 that will require ingredient transparency online and onlabel by 2020 and 2021 respectively new york has published ingredient disclosure guidance based on existing regulation but final compliance has been delayed due to litigation the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe”“safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency’s “epa” capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the tsca changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach and the 2010 2013 and 2018 registration deadlines to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan turkey and other countries are implementing similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation by 2020 and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we met the 2015 deadlines in the us and european union and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in other countries eg australia canada thailand potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position the same is true for emerging biocide regulations in asia 

  

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

 

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 60 million in 2018 and 70 million in 2017 approximately 60 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2019 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth 

  

furthermore climaterelated risks are assessed within our enterprise risk management process and annual business significance risks assessment which is aligned with recommendations of the financial stability board fsb task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd ecolab is evaluating further application of the recommendations of the tcfd over the next three to five years in alignment with the recommended timeline from the tcfd 

  

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2016 they include a 25 percent reduction in water withdrawals and a 10 percent reduction in ghg emissions by 2020 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than three million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and ghg emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services we also introduced a customer impact goal for the first time by partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our solutions we aim to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean‑up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 28 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at seven sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

the prosecution office of liu he district nanjing city jingsu province china brought charges alleging violation of environmental laws relating to waste disposal against the company’s nalco subsidiary in nanjing city china on november 26 2018 prior to these charges being alleged related charges were brought against certain individual employees of the subsidiary the case which is seeking to assess monetary penalties is pending for trial before the people’s court of liu he district the subsidiary could also be subject to a separate civil penalty we anticipate that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

 

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 3 million in 2018 and 6 million in 2017 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2018 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 17 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

  

under the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 which added section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 the company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain executive orders disclosure is required even where the activities are conducted outside the us by nonus affiliates in compliance with applicable law and even if the activities are not covered or prohibited by us law after the easing of certain sanctions by the united states against iran in january 2016 pursuant to the joint comprehensive plan of action relating to iran’s nuclear program jcpoa and in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by us treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac and us export control laws a whollyowned nonus subsidiary of the company conducting business in our energy operating segment has completed sales relating to iran pursuant to and in compliance with the terms and conditions of ofac’s general license h including sales of products used for process and water treatment applications in i upstream oil and gas production and ii petrochemical plants the company has reported these sales in its previous reports on form 10q and form 10k 

  

on may 8 2018 the president announced his decision to cease the united states’ participation in the jcpoa and to begin reimposing following a winddown period the sanctions that were lifted to effectuate the jcpoa sanctions relief in conjunction with this announcement the president issued a national security presidential memorandum nspm directing the secretary of state and the secretary of the treasury to prepare immediately for the reimposition of all of the us sanctions lifted or waived in connection with the jcpoa to be accomplished as expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 180 days from the date of the nspm on june 27 2018 ofac revoked general license h and issued a winddown general license that authorized through november 4 2018 the wind down of activities involving iran that were previously authorized pursuant to general license h our nonus subsidiary timely completed the winding down of its business activities in iran pursuant to the winddown license for its fiscal year 2018 through the completion of the winddown period our nonus subsidiary completed the following sales related to businesses in our energy operating segment to a distributor in dubai and two distributors in iran sales of products used for process and water treatment applications in i upstream oil and gas production and ii petrochemical plants totaling 47 million the net profit before taxes associated with these sales is estimated to be 09 million

forwardlooking statements 

  

this form 10k including part i item 1 entitled “business” and the mda within part ii item 7 contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements include expectations concerning items such as 

  

















































  

without limiting the foregoing words or phrases such as “will likely result” “are expected to” “will be” “will continue” “is anticipated” “we believe” “we expect” “estimate” “project” including the negative or variations thereof “intends” “could” or similar terminology generally identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may also represent challenging goals for us these statements which represent the company’s expectations or beliefs concerning various future events are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forwardlooking statements we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on such forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made for a further discussion of these and other factors which could cause results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement see item 1a of this form 10k entitled “risk factors” except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

  

 




 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

  

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the well completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices in 2015 and 2016 the global energy segment experienced decreased sales as a result of very challenging global energy market conditions in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe and emerging markets such as china and brazil has also negatively impacted many of our endmarkets weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during these periods of weaker economic activity our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors   

  

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future for example in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar additionally the june 2016 brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies and has caused increased fluctuations and unpredictability in foreign currency exchange rates the possibility for referendum by other eu member states may lead to further market volatility other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk as a result of increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to deconsolidation across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 we devalued our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives including our enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrade our business could be adversely affected  

  

we continue to execute key business initiatives including investments to develop business systems and restructurings such as those discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we are implementing an erp system upgrade which is expected to continue in phases over the next several years this upgrade which includes supply chain commercial operations and certain finance functions is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes the upgrade involves complex business process   design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

  

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and random attack acquisitions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data security breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption and legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets and sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business certain of our customer offerings include digital components such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations a breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential third party claims and reputational damage there may be other related challenges and risks as we continue to implement our erp system upgrade 

  

 

we are pursuing a plan to spin off our upstream energy business into an independent publicly traded company the proposed spinoff may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

  

we have announced a plan to spin off our upstream energy business into an independent publicly traded company by midyear 2020 unanticipated developments including possible delays in obtaining various regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed spinoff or cause the proposed spinoff to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable andor different than expected even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed spinoff may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate executing the proposed spinoff also requires significant time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business following the proposed spinoff the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spinoff not occurred 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

  

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract retain and develop a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities as we continue to grow our business make acquisitions expand our geographic scope and offer new products and services we need the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for executive officer and key employee roles in order to match the growth and development of our business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract retain or develop such officers or key employees 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  

  

we have numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high valueadded products technology and service we must also continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative profitable and high valueadded products for niche applications and commercial digital applications we have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings which are becoming a more important part of our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

  

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2018 approximately 47 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  































  

brexit and the subsequent notification in march 2017 of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu has created uncertainties in the economic political and business environment in the uk and the eu while the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets or the failure to reach such agreements the uncertainties created by brexit any resolution between the uk and eu countries or the failure to reach any such resolutions could adversely affect our relationships with customers suppliers and employees and could adversely affect our business 

  

 

in addition changes in us or foreign government policy on international trade including the imposition or continuation of tariffs could adversely affect our business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on certain imports from china and other countries resulting in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries these tariffs and any additional tariffs imposed by the us china or other countries or any additional retaliatory measures by any of these countries could increase our costs reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our results could be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

  

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors could affect our results 

  

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

  

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows changes to labor and employment laws and regulations as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies could adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs 

  

as described in part ii item 8 note 15 “commitments and contingencies” of this form 10k nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” have been named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories 

  

there currently remain nine cases pending against nalco we expect they will be dismissed pursuant to a november 28 2012 order granting nalco’s motion for summary judgment we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

 

nalco continues to sell the corexit oil dispersant product and could be exposed to future lawsuits from the use of such product we cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales however if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won these suits could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that could impact our results 

  

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  

  

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

  

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act including but not limited to variability in our future tax rate we are also subject to changes in tax law outside the united states such as interpretation as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the european union state aid rules in addition we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws including regulations which interpret the tax act or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

  

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 70 billion in outstanding indebtedness with approximately 742 million in the form of floating rate debt our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences including 

  



  



  



  



  

if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

  

 

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business 

  

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions 

  

we expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2018 we had goodwill of 71 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and champion transactions if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business  

  

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

  

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events d war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets e natural or manmade disasters f water shortages or g severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement personal injury product liability wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

  

federal government shutdowns can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by disrupting or delaying new product launches renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or export licenses for raw materials or products 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in particular the us gulf coast is a region with significant refining petrochemicals and chemicals operations which provide us raw materials as well as being an important customer base for our energy and water operating segments hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the gulf coast could adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost or at all and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region

comparability of results 

  

adoption of new accounting standards 

  

on january 1 2018 we retrospectively adopted the accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers and the related amendments “the new revenue standard” concurrent with the adoption of the new revenue standard we reclassified certain costs from selling general and administrative expenses to cost of sales to align the cost of providing the service with the recognition of service revenue the new revenue standard was applied to all periods presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard is recognized at the beginning of the earliest year presented 

  

we also retrospectively adopted accounting standards update 201707 compensation – retirement benefits improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost relating to the presentation of the components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits within the consolidated statement of income “the new pension standard” 

  

all comparisons and discussion throughout the mda reflect the adoption of the new revenue standard and new pension standard further information about the adoption of the accounting standards is included in note 2 

  

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

  

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established fixed currency amounts during 2018 for argentina operations are reflected at the argentine peso rate established by management at the beginning of the year public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only 

  

comparability of reportable segments 

  

effective in the first quarter of 2018 we established the colloidal technologies group “ctg” operating segment the ctg operating segment has not been aggregated based on qualitative criteria and is included in other ctg produces and sells colloidal silica which is comprised of nanosized particles of silica in water these products and associated programs are used primarily for binding and polishing applications ctg was previously recorded in the water operating segment which is aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment prior to the sale in november 2017 the equipment care operating segment was also included which provided kitchen repair and maintenance additionally we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments all comparisons and discussion throughout the mda are based on the new operating segment structure effective in the first quarter of 2018 

  

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

  

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture 

  

 

executive summary 

  

we achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2018 as we drove new product introductions new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally improved market environment increased pricing was implemented to offset significantly higher delivered product costs adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth benefiting from lower interest expense and taxes to deliver the year’s doubledigit adjusted diluted eps growth 

  

sales 

  

reported sales increased 6 to 147 billion in 2018 from 138 billion in 2017 sales were positively impacted by volume and pricing when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales increased 6 compared to the prior year acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6 compared to the prior year 

  

gross margin 

  

our reported gross margin was 412 of sales for 2018 compared to our 2017 reported gross margin of 417 excluding the impact of special gains and charges included in cost of sales from both 2018 and 2017 our adjusted gross margin was 413 in 2018 and 420 in 2017 

  

operating income 

  

reported operating income was flat at 195 billion in 2018 compared to 195 billion in 2017 adjusted operating income excluding the impact of special gains and charges increased 5 in 2018 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange adjusted fixed currency operating income also increased 5 

  

earnings attributable to ecolab per common share “eps”   

  

reported diluted eps decreased 5 to 488 in 2018 compared to 512 in 2017 special gains and charges had an impact on both years special gains and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation special gains and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform restructuring charges other discrete taxes acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of equipment care special gains and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by energy related charges restructuring charges other gains and charges and venezuelan related actions adjusted diluted eps which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items increased to 525 in 2018 compared to 468 in 2017 

  

balance sheet 

  

we remain committed to maintaining “a” range ratings metrics supported by our current credit ratings of abaa1 by the major ratings agencies our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates 

  

net debt to ebitda 

  

our net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 23 and 24 for 2018 and 2017 respectively we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization se e the “net debt to ebitda” table on page 43 for reconciliation information 

  

cash flow 

  

cash flow from operating activities was 23 billion in 2018 compared to 21 billion in 2017 we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in our business debt repayments pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments 

  

dividends 

  

we increased our quarterly cash dividend 12 in december 2018 to an indicated annual rate of 184 per share the increase represents our 27th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 82nd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development strong cash flows solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead 

  

 

critical accounting estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes” 

  

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following  

  

revenue recognition 

  

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards committee 606 asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized for additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard see note 2 

  

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment which is over time service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided typically revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided which corresponds with the transfer of control revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 840 leases and recognized on a straightline basis over the length of the lease contract 

  

our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives at the time the sale is recorded we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts as discussed below depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive  

  

the new revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach including the related deliverables the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services which most closely aligned within the operating segments in addition the accountability for the business operations as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings are performed at the operating segment level 

  

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates in addition our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits actual results could differ from these estimates 

  

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 61 million and 72 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 17 million and 15 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 01 01 and 02 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required  

  

for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2 

  

 

accrued liabilities 

  

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 

  

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position 

  

for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 15  

  

actuarially determined liabilities 

  

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

  

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses 

  

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans increased to 539 million as of december 31 2018 from 527 million as of december 31 2017 both before tax primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses 

  

 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2018 on the december 31 2018 funded status and 2019 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans  

  



  

  



  

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information 

  

see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations  

  

self insurance 

  

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

  

restructuring 

  

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which typically is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet our restructuring liability balance was 79 million and 42 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

for additional information on our restructuring activities see note 3  

  

 

income taxes 

  

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted which reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the base erosion anti abuse tax beat and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii 

  

we initially recorded an estimate of the onetime transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 160 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of 66 million primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 us federal tax return and final balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax as of december 31 2018 we completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax 

  

in january 2018 accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy to either treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the deferred method we have elected the period cost method and have considered the estimated 2018 gilti impact in our 2018 tax expense 

  

additionally proposed regulations were released during 2018 certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge therefore we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the tax act and not the proposed regulations if the proposed regulations become final we will record the impact at that time 

  

effective income tax rate 

  

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances this expected annual rate is then applied to our yeartodate operating results in the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period 

  

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

  

temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements 

  

prior to the enactment of the tax act us deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings as part of the tax act we recorded a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries which is payable over eight years we will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns ecolab and nalco through 2014 and the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions 

  

 

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 50 million and 62 million as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

for additional information on income taxes see note 12  

  

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

  

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

  

we periodically review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 71 billion and 70 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value   

  

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships 

  

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base our customer retention rate and history of maintaining longterm relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future additionally other less certain postacquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships if our customer retention rate or other postacquisition operational activities changed materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets 

  

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets 

  

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

  

we had total goodwill of 71 billion and 72 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments 

  

for our 2018 impairment assessment we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow approach the twostep quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any our goodwill impairment assessment for 2018 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin we will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented 

  

as part of the nalco merger we added the “nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset the total value of which was 12 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing using a relief from royalty assessment method during the second quarter of 2018 based on this testing no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary additionally no events during the second half of 2018 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2018

net sales 

  



  

the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below 

  



  

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

  



  

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales 

  

our reported gross margin was 412 417 and 427 for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our 2018 2017 and 2016 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 93 million 440 million and 660 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the “special gains and charges” table on page 33 

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2018 adjusted gross margin was 413 compared against a 2017 adjusted gross margin of 420 the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs more than offsetting the impact from increased pricing and cost savings  

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 420 and 432 for 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in global energy which on average has a lower gross margin which more than offset pricing and cost savings  

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

  



  

the decreased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2018 against 2017 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage the 2017 restructuring efforts and cost savings which more than offset investments in the business

operating income and operating income margin 

  



  

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales 

  

our reported operating income remained flat when comparing 2018 to 2017 and increased 4 when comparing 2017 to 2016 our reported operating income for 2018 2017 and 2016 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2018 adjusted operating income increased 5 when compared to 2017 adjusted operating income and 2017 adjusted operating income increased 1 when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income 

  

as shown in the previous table foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2018 and 2017 

  

other income expense 

  

other income expense relates to the income from the nonservice components of pension cost which were 799 million 673 million and 438 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in income is primarily due to expected returns on increased pension assets

the decrease in our 2018 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2017 was driven primarily by lower interest rates on debt the decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt 

  

 

provision for income taxes 

  

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate 

  



  

our reported tax rate was 202 138 and 244 for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future the enactment of the tax act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate 

  

we recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of 47 million during 2018 in the third quarter of 2018 we filed us federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of 399 million related to changes in estimates and an irs approved method change us tax reform as described further below resulted in 660 million expense for 2018 sharebased compensation excess tax benefit contributed 281 million in 2018 the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in nonus jurisdictions audit settlements and both international and us changes in estimates 

  

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted which reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the base erosion anti abuse tax beat and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii in january 2018 accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of our deferred taxes the deferred method we have elected the period cost method and considered the estimated 2018 gilti impact in our 2018 tax expense 

  

we initially recorded an estimate of the onetime transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of 1601 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of 660 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the tax act primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits our 2017 reported rate also includes a 3190 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the us enacted tax rate of 21 our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special gains and charges as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of us tax reform of 78 million during 2017 we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of 397 million related to excess tax benefits in addition we recorded net discrete expenses of 144 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 us federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters 

  

our 2016 reported tax rate includes 431 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of 39 million associated with discrete tax items the net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 us federal income tax return partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions 

  

the change in our adjusted tax rate from 2016 to 2018 was primarily driven by enactment of the tax act global tax planning projects and geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to the tax act other changes in global tax rules further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

additionally we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions these credit lines support our daily global funding needs primarily our global cash pooling structures we have 150 million of bank supported letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments  

  

as of december 31 2018 standard  poor’s and fitch both rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and moody’s rated our longterm credit at baa1 stable outlook a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities 

  

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures 

  

a schedule of our various obligations as of december 31 2018 are summarized in the following table  

  



  

interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at yearend 2018 

  

as of december 31 2018 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 50 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2019 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 48 million in 2019 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles 

  

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases as discussed further in note 13 we do not participate in offbalance sheet financing arrangements through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships  

  

market risk 

  

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2018 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges 

  

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2018 we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of 400 million 

  

see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity 

  

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 258 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items  

  

global economic and political environment 

  

energy markets 

  

approximately 23 of our sales are generated from our global energy segment the results of which as noted further below are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets 

  

during 2018 oil industry drilling and production activity showed improved volumes over 2017 led by strong gains in north america drilling and production activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends while international activity remained soft demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016 

  

our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market as such we continue to remain confident in the longterm growth prospects of the segment 

  

global economies 

  

approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results 

  

argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates devaluation of the argentine peso and increasing borrowing rates argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with us gaap and the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina during 2018 sales in argentina represented less than 1 of our consolidated sales assets held in argentina at the end of 2018 represented less than 1 of our consolidated assets 

  

 

brexit referendum 

  

on march 29 2017 the united kingdom “uk” government gave formal notice to the european union “eu” to begin the process of negotiating the uk’s exit “brexit” from the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and exemptions that apply to transactions between the uk and eu in the longer term any impact from brexit on our uk operations will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations we will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the uk and eu 

  

during 2018 net sales of our uk operations were approximately 2 of our consolidated net sales 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 

  

subsequent events 

  

acquisitions 

  

subsequent to yearend we closed on the acquisition of bioquell plc a leading provider of hydrogen peroxide vapor biodecontamination systems and services for the life sciences and healthcare industries and acquired lobster ink a leading provider of endtoend online customer training solutions we also entered into various purchase and sale agreements which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 none of the agreements are significant to the consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate 

  

  

upstream energy spinoff 

  

ecolab intends to pursue subject to the receipt of approval by ecolab’s board of directors and any regulatory approvals a plan to separate and spinoff the upstream group of ecolab’s global energy segment the upstream business through a series of taxefficient transactions collectively the spinoff under the plan if effectuated ecolab’s shareholders would own 100 of the common stock of a new corporation that owns the upstream business the spinoff is expected to be completed in 2020 and is intended to qualify as a taxfree distribution to ecolab shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

  

in anticipation of and to facilitate the spinoff ecolab is currently planning for the internal separation of the upstream business through a series of transactions that are intended to be taxefficient from a us federal income tax perspective the spinoff is expected to consist of two phases i a series of internal transactions undertaken by ecolab and its direct and indirect subsidiaries to separate the upstream business from ecolab’s other businesses including multiple distributions intended to qualify as taxfree distributions for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code collectively the internal separations followed by ii an external distribution by ecolab of the common stock of a newlyformed corporation owning the upstream business to current ecolab shareholders owning ecolab shares in a distribution that is intended to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under section 355 of the internal revenue code 

  

the internal separations are currently expected to occur in the united states and in or involving entities domiciled in various other jurisdictions including but not limited to luxembourg the netherlands jersey saudi arabia the united kingdom singapore and switzerland in particular the ecolab subsidiaries which shall also include any of their successors and transferees that are anticipated to be distributing corporations in connection with the internal separations include ecolab lux 9 sà rl ecolab nl 11 bv nalco overseas holding bv nalco holding bv ecolab lux 11 sà rl ecolab lux 10 sà rl ecolab us 2 inc ecolab lux 7 sà rl ecolab ch 2 gmbh ecolab nl 3 bv ecolab lux 1 sà rl ecolab lux 2 sà rl nalco saudi co ltd nalco gulf limited nalco manufacturing ltd ecolab pte ltd ecolab usa inc nalco holding company and nalco us 2 inc in addition certain ecolab subsidiaries or their respective successors and transferees listed on exhibit 211 may also be distributing corporations in connection with the internal separations

international operations   

  

we directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

  

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions and regulations ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competition 

  

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our global energy reportable segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product quality technical expertise chemical formulations effective global supply chain strong customer service and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership

environmental and regulatory considerations 

  

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean‑up fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area last year california passed the cleaning product right to know act of 2017 which will require ingredient transparency online and onlabel by 2020 and 2021 respectively new york is in the process of drafting similar regulations with an expected passage in 2018 the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe”“safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency “epa” epa’s capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the new tsca rules will mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines and are on track to meet the final registration deadlines and requirements in 2018 to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan and other countries are implementing similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we met the 2015 deadlines in the us and european union and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in other countries eg thailand potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position the same is true for emerging biocide regulations in asia 

  

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into 

 

the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 70 million in 2017 and 60 million in 2016 approximately 43 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2018 the decrease in 2018 from 2017 is due to the completion of several large safety projects at our manufacturing facilities 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and have made significant strides in recent years in 2014 we received a climate leadership award cosponsored by epa recognizing ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 125 percent 224 percent intensity reduction 

  

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2016 they include a 25 percent reduction in water withdrawals and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than one million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services we also introduced a customer impact goal for the first time by partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our solutions we aim to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean‑up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 35 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at seven sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 6 million in 2017 and 9 million in 2016 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2017 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 21 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 

  

under the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 which added section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 the company is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain executive orders disclosure is required even where the activities are conducted outside the us by nonus affiliates in compliance with applicable law and even if the activities are not covered or prohibited by us law after the easing of certain sanctions by the united states against iran in january 2016 and in compliance with the economic sanctions regulations administered by us treasury’s office of foreign assets control 

 

ofac and us export control laws a whollyowned nonus subsidiary of the company completed the following sales related to businesses in our energy operating segment pursuant to and in compliance with the terms and conditions of ofac’s general license h sales of products used for process and water treatment applications in i upstream oil and gas production and ii petrochemical plants totaling 59 million during the subsidiary’s fiscal year ended november 30 2017 and additional sales of such products totaling 04 million during december 2017 were made to a distributor in dubai and two distributors in iran the net profit before taxes associated with these sales is estimated to be 16 million and 01 million respectively our nonus subsidiary intends to continue doing business in iran under general license h in compliance with us economic sanctions and export control laws which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to the abovementioned statute

forwardlooking statements 

  

this form 10k including part i item 1 entitled “business” and the mda within part ii item 7 contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements include expectations concerning items such as 

  















































  

 

without limiting the foregoing words or phrases such as “will likely result” “are expected to” “will be” “will continue” “is anticipated” “we believe” “we expect” “estimate” “project” including the negative or variations thereof “intends” “could” or similar terminology generally identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may also represent challenging goals for us these statements which represent the company’s expectations or beliefs concerning various future events are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forwardlooking statements we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on such forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date made for a further discussion of these and other factors which could cause results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement see item 1a of this form 10k entitled “risk factors” except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

  

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the well completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices in 2015 and 2016 the global energy segment experienced decreased sales as a result of very challenging global energy market conditions in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe and emerging markets such as china and brazil has also negatively impacted many of our endmarkets weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such cycles these endusers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business   

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors   

  

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar additionally the june 2016 brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies and the possibility for referendum by other eu member states may lead to further market volatility other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk as a result of increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to deconsolidation across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 we devalued our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives including our enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrade our business could be adversely affected  

  

we continue to execute key business initiatives including investments to develop business systems and restructurings such as those discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we are implementing an erp system upgrade which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years this upgrade which includes supply chain and certain finance functions is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes the upgrade involves complex business process   design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

  

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and random attack the nalco and champion transactions as well as more recent acquisitions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data security breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent failures cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption and legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets and sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business there may be other related challenges and risks as we continue to implement our erp system upgrade 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

  

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue the integration of new businesses which may be led by personnel that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract or retain such officers or key employees 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

  

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2017 approximately 47 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including   

  































  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  

  

our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications and commercial digital applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive 

 

disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

  

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows changes to labor and employment laws and regulations as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies could adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability 

  

our results could be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

  

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows  in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors could affect our results 

  

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs 

  

our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” were named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

these cases were administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” 

  

nalco company the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims against nalco because claims remained pending against other defendants the court’s decision was not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the court’s decision we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these 

 

lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in december 2012 and january 2013 the mdl court issued final orders approving two settlements between bp and plaintiffs’ class counsel 1 a proposed medical benefits class action settlement and 2 a proposed economic and property damages class action settlement pursuant to the proposed settlements class members agree to release claims against bp and other released parties including nalco company and its related entities 

  

nalco was named in nine additional complaints in may 2016 and two additional complaints in april 2017 filed by individuals alleging among other things business and economic loss resulting from the deepwater horizon oil spill the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs these actions have been consolidated in the mdl certain of these complaints were dismissed on july 19 2017 

  

on february 22 2017 the federal court in the mdl ordered that plaintiffs who had previously filed a claim and who had “opted out” of and not released their claims under the medical benefits class action settlement either 1 complete a sworn statement indicating among other things that they opted out of the medical benefits class action settlement to be completed by plaintiffs who previously filed an individual complaint or 2 file an individual lawsuit attaching the sworn statement as an exhibit by a deadline date set by the court on july 18 2017 the court dismissed certain claims not complying with such order 

  

there currently remain nine cases pending against nalco we expect they will be dismissed pursuant to the court’s november 28 2012 order granting nalco’s motion for summary judgment 

  

nalco continues to sell the corexit oil dispersant product and could be exposed to future lawsuits from the use of such product we cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales however if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won these suits could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that could impact our results 

  

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected    

  

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

  

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” signed by the president of the united states on december 22 2017 which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act including but not limited to variability in our future tax rate we are also subject to changes in tax law outside the united states such as interpretation as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the european union state aid rules in addition we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

 

our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements 

  

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 73 billion in outstanding indebtedness with approximately 10 billion in the form of floating rate debt our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences including 

  



  



  



  



  

if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business 

  

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions 

  

we expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2017 we had goodwill of 72 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and champion transactions if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business  

  

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

  

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

 

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

our manufacturing philosophy is to manufacture products wherever an economic process or quality assurance advantage exists or where proprietary manufacturing techniques dictate inhouse production currently most products that we sell are manufactured at our facilities we position our manufacturing locations and warehouses in a manner to permit ready access to our customers 

  

our manufacturing facilities produce chemical products as well as medical devices and equipment for all of our operating segments although pest elimination purchases the majority of their products and equipment from outside suppliers our chemical production process consists of producing intermediates via basic reaction chemistry and subsequently blending and packaging those intermediates with other purchased raw materials into finished products in powder solid and liquid form our devices and equipment manufacturing operations consist of producing chemical product dispensers and injectors and other mechanical equipment medical devices dishwasher racks related sundries dish machine refurbishment and water monitoring and maintenance equipment system from purchased components and subassemblies 

  

the following table profiles our more significant physical properties with approximately 70000 square feet or more with ongoing production activities as well as certain other facilities important in terms of specialization and sources of supply in general manufacturing facilities located in the united states serve our us markets and facilities located outside of the united states serve our international markets however most of the united states facilities do manufacture products for export 

  

plant profiles 



 



  

generally our manufacturing facilities are adequate to meet our existing inhouse production needs we continue to invest in our plant sites to maintain viable operations and to add capacity as necessary to meet business imperatives

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

the following management discussion and analysis “mda” provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results cash flows and financial condition we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level we also provide quantitative information regarding special gains and charges discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance  

  

the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10k our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap this discussion contains various nongaap financial measures and also contains various forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “nongaap financial measures” at the end of this mda and “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” within items 1 and 1a of this form 10k 

  

comparability of results 

  

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

  

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established fixed currency amounts for 2015 also reflect all venezuelan bolivar operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations at the marginal currency system “simadi” rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only 

  

venezuela related activities 

  

effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries prior to deconsolidation due to the country’s highly inflationary economy the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiaries was the us dollar as a result currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 the venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 63 bolivares to 1 us dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar as noted above within our fixed currency sales and operating results to present our historical venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate we have reflected all venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 reporting year at a simadi conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar 

  

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

  

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and exclude the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods 

  

executive summary 

  

we achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2017 as we drove new product introductions new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a mixed market environment increased pricing was implemented to offset higher delivered product costs earnings per share leveraged the solid operating income growth benefiting from lower interest expense taxes and shares outstanding to deliver the solid eps growth 

  

sales 

  

reported sales increased 5 to 138 billion in 2017 from 132 billion in 2016 sales were positively impacted by volume pricing and acquisitions when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales increased 5 compared to the prior year see the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “net sales” table on page 32 and the “sales by reportable segment” table on page 38 for reconciliation information 

  

 

gross margin 

  

our reported gross margin was 465 of sales for 2017 compared to our 2016 reported gross margin of 475 excluding the impact of special gains and charges included in cost of sales from both 2017 and 2016 our adjusted gross margin was 468 in 2017 and 480 in 2016 see the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “cost of sales and gross profit margin” table on page 32 for reconciliation information

earnings attributable to ecolab per common share “eps”   

  

reported diluted eps increased 24 to 513 in 2017 compared to 414 in 2016 special gains and charges had an impact on both years special gains and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform restructuring charges other discrete taxes acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of equipment care special gains and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by energy related charges venezuelan related actions restructuring charges and other gains and charges adjusted diluted eps which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items increased to 469 in 2017 compared to 437 in 2016 see the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “diluted eps” table on page 37 for reconciliation information  

  

balance sheet 

  

we remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet supported by our current credit ratings of abaa1 by the major ratings agencies and to achieving “a” range ratings metrics we believe our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates 

  

net debt to ebitda 

  

our net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 24 and 23 for 2017 and 2016 respectively our net debt to adjusted ebitda defined as the sum of ebitda and special gains and charges impacting ebitda was 24 for 2017 and 22 for 2016 we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization se e the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “net debt to ebitda” table on page 43 for reconciliation information 

  

cash flow 

  

cash flow from operating activities was 21 billion in 2017 compared to 19 billion in 2016 we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in our business debt repayments pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments see the section entitled “cash flows” within this mda for further information 

  

dividends 

  

we increased our quarterly cash dividend 11 in december 2017 to an indicated annual rate of 164 per share the increase represents our 26th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 81st consecutive year we have paid cash dividends our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development strong cash flows solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead 

  

 

critical accounting estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes” 

  

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following  

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured we recognize revenue on services as they are performed while we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in note 17 

  

our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives at the time the sale is recorded we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts as discussed below depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive  

  

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards committee 606 asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized for additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard see note 2 

  

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates in addition our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits actual results could differ from these estimates 

  

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 72 million and 68 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 15 million and 14 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 01 in 2017 and 02 in 2016 and 2015 we believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required  

  

for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2 

  

 

accrued liabilities 

  

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 

  

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position 

  

for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 15  

  

actuarially determined liabilities 

  

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

  

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses 

  

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased to 527 million as of december 31 2017 from 533 million as of december 31 2016 both before tax primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses 

  

 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2017 on the december 31 2017 funded status and 2018 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans  

  



  

  



  

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information 

  

see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations  

  

self insurance 

  

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

  

restructuring 

  

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which typically is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet our restructuring liability balance was 42 million and 40 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

income taxes 

  

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously indefinitely reinvested and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the tax act adds many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the base erosion anti abuse tax beat and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income fdii some of these provisions such as the tax on gilti may not apply to the company with full effect until future years the company is assessing the impact of the provisions of the act that do not apply until later years 

  

the two material items that impact us for 2017 are the reduction in the us federal tax rate as it relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet and the onetime transition tax that is imposed on our unremitted foreign earnings we have recorded provisional amounts for the income tax effects that included the reporting period the tax act was enacted judgement was used when applying the provisions of the tax act including assumptions related to the impact of the lower corporate rate and other analyses including but not limited to estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates and our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income our provisional amounts are subject to further adjustments during the measurement period of up to one year following enactment of the tax act as provided by recent sec guidance 

  

effective income tax rate 

  

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances this expected annual rate is then applied to our yeartodate operating results in the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period 

  

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

  

temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements 

  

prior to the enactment of the tax act us deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings upon enactment of the tax act we recorded a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries which is payable over eight years we will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes

uncertain tax positions 

  

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns ecolab and nalco through 2014 our us federal income tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions 

  

 

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 62 million and 76 million as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

  

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

  

we periodically review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 70 billion and 64 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value   

  

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships 

  

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base our customer retention rate and history of maintaining longterm relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future additionally other less certain postacquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships if our customer retention rate or other postacquisition operational activities changed materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets 

  

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets 

  

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

  

we had total goodwill of 72 billion and 64 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments ten subsequent to the divestiture of the equipment care business 

  

for our 2017 impairment assessment we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow approach the twostep quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any our goodwill impairment assessment for 2017 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin we will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments in the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold the equipment care business which was one of our reporting units and operating segments and the goodwill associated with equipment care was disposed of upon sale no goodwill impairment was realized as a result of the sale and no other events occurred during the second half of 2017 indicating a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017 

  

as part of the nalco merger we added the “nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset the total value of which was 12 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing using a relief from royalty assessment method during the second quarter of 2017 based on this testing no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary additionally no events during the second half of 2017 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017 

  

 

results of operations 

  

net sales 

  



  

the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below 

  



  

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

  



  

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales 

  

our reported gross margin was 465 475 and 467 for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our 2017 2016 and 2015 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 440 million 660 million and 806 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the “special gains and charges” table on page 33 

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2017 adjusted gross margin was 468 compared against a 2016 adjusted gross margin of 480 the decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in global energy which on average has a lower gross margin which more than offset pricing and cost savings  

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 480 and 473 for 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in global energy which on average has a lower gross margin  

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

  



  

the decreased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2017 against 2016 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage and cost savings which more than offset investments in the business and the impact of acquisitions  

  

the increased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions investments in the business and the decline in global energy which on average has a lower sga ratio 

  

 

special gains and charges 

  

special gains and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items 



  

for segment reporting purposes special gains and charges are not allocated to reportable segments which is consistent with our internal management reporting 

  

restructuring activities 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3  

  

during the second quarter of 2017 we commenced restructuring and other costsaving actions in order to streamline our operations these actions include a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 570 positions as well as asset disposals and lease terminations as a result of these actions we have incurred restructuring charges of 455 million 327 million after tax or 011 per diluted share during 2017 actions were substantially completed in 2017 as of december 31 2017 the restructuring liability balance related to these activities was 232 million the majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will be funded from operating activities cash payments during 2017 related to actions initiated in 2017 were 178 million 

  

we recorded net restructuring gains related to legacy restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2015 of 10 million 004 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share during 2017 w e recorded net restructuring gains of 91 million 108 million after tax or 004 per diluted share in 2016 and net restructuring charges of 1003 million 772 million after tax or 025 per diluted share during 2015 the legacy restructuring plans liability balance was 183 million 396 million and 901 million as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the reduction in liability balance was driven primarily by severance and other cash payments the remaining accrual is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and continues to be funded from operating activities 

  

 

acquisition and integration related costs 

  

acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income in 2017 include 132 million 86 million after tax or 003 per diluted share related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of swisher plants accelerated rent expense and amounts related to recognition of fair value stepup in the anios inventory

fixed asset impairment and other charges 

  

during 2017 we recorded other charges of 262 million 197 million after tax or 007 per diluted share primarily relating to fixed asset impairments and a global energy vendor contract termination 

  

during 2015 we recorded fixed asset impairment charge of 247 million 154 million after tax or 005 per diluted share consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our us plants during 2016 we recorded an additional charge of 100 million 63 million after tax or 002 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment as well as related inventory charges subsequent to the charge the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets was less than 5 million inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products 

  

these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income 

  

inventory costs and reserve 

  

during 2015 we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing resulting in a net pretax charge of 61 million separately the actions resulted in a charge of 206 million 159 million after tax or 005 per diluted share related to inventory reserve calculations partially offset by a gain of 145 million 122 million after tax or 004 per diluted share related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory during 2016 we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory which resulted in a gain of 62 million 46 million after tax or 002 per diluted share 

  

energy related charges 

  

oil industry activity was depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels resulting from excess oil supply pressures which negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry particularly in north america as a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook we recorded total charges of 768 million 500 million after tax or 017 per diluted share comprised of inventory writedowns and related disposal costs fixed asset charges headcount reductions and other charges in 2016 no such charges were incurred in 2017 

  

the inventory writedowns and related disposal costs of 405 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specificuse and other products coupled with declines in replacement costs as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory the fixed asset charges of 204 million resulted from the writedown of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our north american operations within the global energy segment as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction the carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero the employee termination costs of 131 million include a reduction in our global energy segment’s global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term as of the end of 2017 the remaining severance liability was minimal 

  

the charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

  

 

venezuela related activities 

  

effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016 the conditions within venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016 and 2017 prior to deconsolidation we remeasured our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and the bolivar portion of our venezuelan operations within energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 63 bolivares to 1 us dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar as a result of the ownership structure of our food  beverage and institutional operations in venezuela we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income upon deconsolidation we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment the total charges during 2015 related to our actions in venezuela were 2893 million 2468 million after tax we reflected 111 million of the above charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income resulting in a net charge of 2357 million or 078 per diluted share 

  

we recorded gains due to us dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation of 115 million 72 million after tax or 002 per diluted share and 78 million 49 million after tax or 002 per diluted share in 2017 and 2016 respectively

other 

  

we recorded net gains of 14 million 07 million after tax or less than 001 per diluted share net charges of 332 million 211 million after tax or 007 per diluted share and net charges of 563 million 345 million after tax or 011 per diluted share in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively primarily related to litigation related charges and settlements in 2015 this also included the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our ecovation business offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the champion transaction these items have been included as a component of special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

  

interest expense net 

  

during 2017 in anticipation of us tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years  we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain longterm debt and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of 219 million 136 million after tax or 005 per diluted share this charge has been included as a component of interest expense net on the consolidated statement of income 

  

operating income and operating income margin 

  



  

our operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales 

  

 

our reported operating income increased 5 when comparing 2017 to 2016 and increased 23 when comparing 2016 to 2015 our reported operating income for 2017 2016 and 2015 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2017 adjusted operating income increased 2 when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income and 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 2 when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income 

  

as shown in the previous table foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2017 foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted fixed currency operating income growth for 2016 as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3 

  

interest expense net 



  

reported net interest expense totaled 2550 million 2646 million and 2436 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

the decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt the increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate 

  



  

our reported tax rate for 2017 2016 and 2015 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future the enactment of the tax act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate 

  

our 2017 reported tax rate includes 1609 million of net tax benefits associated with the tax act 62 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net tax benefits of 253 million associated with discrete tax items in connection with our analysis of the impact of the tax act we recorded a provisional net discrete tax benefit of 1609 million in the period ended december 31 2017 which includes a 3210 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the us enacted tax rate and a net expense for the onetime transition tax of 1601 million while we are able to make an estimate of the impact of the reduction in the us rate it may be affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences in addition federal and state tax authorities continue to issue technical guidance which may change the provisional amounts recorded in our financial statements 

  

special gains and charges represent the tax impact of special gains and charges as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of us tax reform of 78 million during 2017 we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of 397 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the adoption of accounting changes regarding the treatment of tax benefits on sharebased compensation the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises in addition we recorded net discrete expenses of 144 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 us federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters 

  

 

our 2016 reported tax rate includes 431 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of 39 million associated with discrete tax items our 2015 reported tax rate includes 1057 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of 633 million associated with discrete tax items the net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 us federal income tax return partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions 

  

net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of 206 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of 390 million for the tax basis in a whollyowned domestic subsidiary 

  

the change in our adjusted tax rate from 2015 to 2017 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to the tax act other changes in global tax rules further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

net sales 

  

fixed currency sales for global energy in 2017 had a strong growth in the well stimulation business while the production business showed a modest decline as growth in north america was offset by international markets sales in our downstream business rose moderately in 2016 fixed currency sales for global energy were negatively impacted by volume reductions and lower pricing continued difficult operating conditions negatively impacted our well stimulation and production businesses due to lower pricing and customer product usage sales in our downstream business were flat in 2016 market challenges in north america drove the reductions from a regional perspective in 2016 

  

operating income 

  

fixed currency operating income for global energy decreased during both 2017 and 2016 as compared to the prior year fixed currency operating income margins also decreased during both comparable periods acquisitions had a negative impact on fixed currency operating income in 2017 and minimal impact on the fixed currency operating income in 2016 acquisitions had a minimal impact on fixed currency operating income margins during both 2017 and 2016 

  

acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins for our global energy segment decreased 04 and 23 percentage points in 2017 and 2016 respectively higher delivered product costs and business investments negatively impacted 2017 by 17 percentage points partially offset by cost savings of 10 percentage points reductions in sales volume product mix changes and lower pricing contributed approximately 57 percentage points to the decline in 2016 which offset the benefit of lower delivered product costs synergies and other cost reduction actions

net sales 

  

fixed currency sales growth for other in both 2017 and 2016 was driven by volume increases and pricing gains at a regional level the 2017 sales increase was led by good growth in north america the 2016 sales increase was led by good growth in asia pacific latin america north america and mea 

  

at an operating segment level   pest elimination fixed currency sales increased 8 in 2017 increase of 7 acquisition adjusted sales to food beverage and hospitality and good growth in restaurants led the growth fixed currency sales increased 8 in 2016 impacted by continued gains in the foodservice market benefiting from customer penetration and new service offerings prior to the sale of equipment care  fixed currency sales increased 2 in 2017 fixed currency sales increased 7 in 2016 driven by continued increases in both service and parts sales benefiting from new customer additions

financial position cash flow and liquidity 

  

financial position 

  

total assets were 200 billion as of december 31 2017 compared to total assets of 183 billion as of december 31 2016 the increase in assets during 2017 was driven primarily by increased goodwill and intangibles as a result of the anios and other acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into us dollars as of year end 2017 

  

total liabilities were 123 billion as of december 31 2017 compared to total liabilities of 114 billion as of december 31 2016 total debt was 73 billion as of december 31 2017 and 67 billion as of december 31 2016 see further discussion of our debt activity within the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda 

  

our net debt to ebitda and net debt to adjusted ebidta are shown in the following table ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap measures which are discussed further in the “nongaap financial measures” section of this mda 

  



  

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  



  

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases 

  

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2015 to 2017 was impacted by f luctuations in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable “working capital” the combination of which increased 56 million 35 million and 119 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections timing of purchases and production and usage levels and volume of purchases and timing of payments 

  

the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions cash activity related to restructuring cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table   

  



  

 

investing activities 

  



  

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business 

  

total cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions in 2017 2016 and 2015 was 870 million 49 million and 265 million respectively our acquisitions and divestitures across 2017 2016 and 2015 are discussed further in note 4 we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our longterm growth 

  

we continue to make capital investments in the business including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities total capital expenditures including software were 869 million 757 million and 815 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

financing activities 

  



  

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt common stock repurchases proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs dividend payments and acquisitionrelated contingent considerations 

  

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders we repurchased a total of 600 million 740 million and 755 million of shares in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively these amounts include 300 million of shares repurchased each year from 2015 through 2017 through our asr programs see note 10 for further information regarding our asr programs cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity 

  

the impact on financing cash flows of commercial paper and notes payable repayments longterm debt borrowings and longterm debt repayments are shown in the following table   

  



  

in december 2017 we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 11 this represents the 26th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 81 consecutive years cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows  

  



  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2018 including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension contributions with cash from operating activities and as needed additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong 

  

as of december 31 2017 we had 211 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 151 million was held outside of the us 

  

as of december 31 2016 we had 327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 184 million was held outside of the us 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had 26 million of deferred tax liabilities for preacquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy nalco entities and legacy champion entities that we intended to repatriate these liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction the remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016 reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at december 31 2016 

  

as of december 31 2017 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in november 2022 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2017 or 2016 

  

the credit facility supports our 20 billion us commercial paper program and 20 billion european commercial paper program combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed 20 billion at yearend we had no amount outstanding under the european commercial paper program and no amount outstanding under the us commercial paper program 

  

additionally we have uncommitted credit lines of 660 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs most of these lines are used to support global cash pooling structures approximately 643 million of these credit lines were available for use as of yearend 2017 bank supported letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees total 198 million and represent commercial business transactions we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments  

  

as of december 31 2017 our shortterm borrowing program was rated a2 by standard  poor’s and p2 by moody’s 

as of december 31 2017 standard  poor’s and moody’s rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and baa1 stable outlook respectively a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities should this occur we could seek additional sources of funding including issuing additional term notes or bonds in addition we have the ability at our option to draw upon our 20 billion of committed credit facility 

  

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures 

  

a schedule of our various obligations as of december 31 2017 are summarized in the following table  

  



  

interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at yearend 2017 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a onetime transition tax related to enactment of the tax act the expense is primarily related to the onetime transition tax which is payable over eight years as discussed further in note 12 this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the enactment of the tax act as provided by recent sec guidance 

  

as of december 31 2017 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 68 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

 

we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2018 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 49 million in 2018 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases as discussed further in note 13 we do not participate in offbalance sheet financing arrangements through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships  

  

market risk 

  

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2017 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges 

  

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2017 we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of 950 million 

  

see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity 

  

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 322 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items  

  

global economic and political environment 

  

energy markets 

  

approximately 23 of our sales are generated from our global energy segment the results of which as noted further below are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets 

  

during 2017 oil industry activity gradually recovered from 2016’s lows with strong gains in north america drilling activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices rising from their lows in early 2016 

  

our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market as such we continue to remain confident in the longterm growth prospects of the segment 

  

global economies 

  

approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results 

  

brexit referendum 

  

on march 29 2017 the united kingdom “uk” government gave formal notice to the european union “eu” to begin the process of negotiating the uk’s exit “brexit” from the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and 

 

exemptions that apply to transactions between the uk and eu in the longer term any impact from brexit on our uk operations will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations we will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the uk and eu 

  

during 2017 net sales of our uk operations were approximately 2 of our consolidated net sales

this reportable segment consists of the institutional specialty and healthcare operating segments which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice hospitality lodging healthcare government education and retail industries the underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes distribution methods and economic characteristics descriptions of the three operating segments which comprise our global institutional reportable segment follow below 

  

institutional 

  

institutional sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” plus specialized cleaners for various applications throughout food service operations for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and healthcare customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as food safety products and equipment water filters dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries institutional also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality healthcare and commercial facilities institutional develops various chemical dispensing systems which are used by our customers to efficiently and safely dispense our cleaners and sanitizers in addition institutional markets a lease program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance through our ecosure food safety management business institutional also provides customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations 

  

institutional sells its products and programs primarily through its field sales and corporate account sales personnel corporate account sales personnel establish relationships and negotiate contracts with larger multiunit or “chain” customers we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice broadline and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers for accounts that prefer to purchase through these distributors many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers through our field sales personnel we generally provide the same customer support to enduse customers supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers 

  

we believe that we are one of the leading global supplier of warewashing and laundry products and programs to the food service hospitality and lodging markets 

  

specialty 

  

specialty supplies cleaning and sanitizing chemical products and related items primarily to regional national and international quick service restaurant “qsr” chains and food retailers ie supermarkets and grocery stores its products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and equipment which are primarily sold under the “kay” and “ecolab” brand names specialty’s cleaning and sanitation programs are customized to meet the needs of the market segments it serves and are designed to provide highly effective cleaning performance promote food safety reduce labor costs and enhance user and guest safety a number of dispensing options are available for products in the core product range specialty supports its product sales with training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers 

  

 

both specialty’s qsr business and its food retail business utilize a corporate account sales force which manages relationships with customers at the corporate headquarters and regional office levels and in the qsr market segment at the franchisee level and a field sales force which provides program support at the individual restaurant or store level qsr customers are primarily supplied through third party distributors while most food retail customers utilize their own distribution networks while specialty’s customer base has grown over the years specialty’s business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of major qsr chains and franchisees and large food retail customers 

  

we believe that specialty is one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global qsr market and a leading supplier of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global food retail market

additional information 

  

international operations   

  

we directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions the profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competition 

  

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring capabilities and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional reportable segment and other have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our global energy reportable segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product quality technical expertise chemical formulations effective global supply chain strong customer service and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership 

  

 

sales 

  

products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors and to a lesser extent sales agents are utilized in several markets as described in the segment descriptions found above 

  

number of employees 

  

we had 47565 employees as of december 31 2016 

  

customers and classes of products 

  

we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2016 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit 

we sold one class of products within the global institutional segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in two of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 11 and 10 of consolidated net sales in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement except for the items listed below we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark 

  



  



  

seasonality 

  

we experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments part ii item 8 note 18 entitled “quarterly financial data” of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference

part ii item 8 note 14 entitled “research and development expenditures” of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

  

joint ventures 

  

over time we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements to achieve quicker operational scale to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers during 2016 the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures in the aggregate was less than three percent the table below identifies our most significant consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture 

  



  

additionally we continue to be party to the ecolab sa joint venture in venezuela which historically operated businesses in our global industrial and global institutional segments this joint venture was included among the venezuelan subsidiaries that we deconsolidated for us gaap purposes effective at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 as further described within the mda and part ii item 8 note 3 of this form 10k 

  

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

 

environmental and regulatory considerations 

  

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean‑up fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states are considering further regulations in this area the california safer consumer products act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe””safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  the nation’s primary chemicals management law the toxic substances control act “tsca” was updated for the first time in 40 years with the passage of the frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act “lcsa” in 2016 the lcsa modernizes the original 1976 legislation aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce improve the us environmental protection agency “epa” epa’s capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances and prevent further state action or more other notification programs like reach see below for ecolab the new tsca rules will mainly impact testing and submission costs for new chemical substances in the united states in addition the epa likely will be more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018 to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan and other countries are planning similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we met the 2015 deadlines in the us and european union and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in other countries eg june 2017 is the final deadline for canada and australia potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

 

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition pest elimination applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

equipment ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements as well as being subject to ul nsf and other approval requirements we have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and thirdparty production of our equipment we are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

other environmental legislation  capital expenditures our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to 

 

directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 60 million in 2016 and 55 million in 2015 approximately 90 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2017 the increase in 2017 over 2016 is due to continued spending on process safety and compliance matters throughout the company including facilities acquired in connection with the champion transaction 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and have made significant strides in recent years in 2014 we received a climate leadership award cosponsored by epa recognizing ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 125 percent 224 percent intensity reduction 

  

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2016 they include a 25 percent reduction in water withdrawals and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than 10 million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services we also introduced a customer impact goal for the first time by partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our solutions we aim to conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean‑up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 24 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at six sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

as previously reported the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” issued a notice of enforcement and notice of violation related to ecolab’s facility in fresno tx on august 29 2014 alleging violations of the facility’s air permits and various state and federal air laws on june 24 2015 the tceq issued a draft consent decree to ecolab for certain violations with the tceq ultimately seeking an administrative penalty of approximately 850000 the company signed an agreed order with the tceq on may 2 2016 to pay this penalty which is subject to approval by the tceq and simultaneously paid the first installment of approximately 425000 the final installment will be paid upon approval of the agreed order by the tceq 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 90 million in 2016 and 65 million in 2015 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2016 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 22 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

economic downturns and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the well completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices in 2015 and 2016 the global energy segment experienced decreased sales as a result of very challenging global energy market conditions in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe and emerging markets such as china and brazil has also negatively impacted many of our endmarkets weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such cycles these endusers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business   

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors   

  

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar additionally the june 2016 brexit vote resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies and the possibility for referendum by other eu member states may lead to further market volatility other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk as a result of increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to deconsolidation across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 we devalued our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

  

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue the integration of new businesses which may be led by personnel that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract or retain such officers or key employees 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  

  

we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we continue to invest in our information technology systems to integrate and streamline our processes and to improve our competitiveness these initiatives involve complex business process 

 

design and a breakdown in certain of these processes could result in business disruption additionally we may undertake in the future business manufacturing initiatives similar to the substantially completed energy restructuring plan and combined restructuring plan discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

  

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack recent acquisitions including the nalco and champion transactions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption and legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets and sensitive information or could otherwise adversely affect our business 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

  

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2016 approximately 47 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including   

  































  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

  

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws 

 

and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we are a defendant in several wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the fair labor standards act “flsa” or a similar state law certain of which have either been certified for class treatment or are seeking such certification while one of the lawsuits has been tentatively settled there can be no assurance that pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs 

  

our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” were named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

all but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” the remaining case was franks v sea tow of south miss inc et al cause no a240210228 circuit court of harrison county mississippi the franks case was dismissed in may 2014 

  

nalco company the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims against nalco because claims remain pending against other defendants the court’s decision is not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the court’s decision we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in may 2016 nalco was named in nine additional complaints filed by individuals alleging among other things business and economic loss resulting from the deepwater horizon oil spill the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are generally seeking awards of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs these actions have been consolidated in the mdl and we expect they will be dismissed pursuant to the court’s november 28 2012 order granting nalco’s motion for summary judgment 

  

nalco continues to sell the corexit oil dispersant product and could be exposed to future lawsuits from the use of such product we cannot predict the potential for future litigation with respect to such sales however if one or more of such lawsuits are brought and won these suits could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  

  

our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

 

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

  

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows  in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results 

  

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare energy food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

we have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility 

  

as of december 31 2016 we had net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents of 64 billion our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects 

  











  

in addition as of december 31 2016 approximately 15 billion of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately 11 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results 

  

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected    

  

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial 

 

position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability 

  

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and our operations plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including potential reforms under the president trump administration and elsewhere such as interpretations as to the legality of tax advantages granted under the european union state aid rules we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits all of which will depend on their timing nature and scope increases in income tax rates changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business 

  

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions 

  

ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2016 we had goodwill of 64 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and champion transactions if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business  

  

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business 

  

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

comparability of results 

  

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

  

management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all venezuelan bolivar operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations at the marginal currency system “simadi” rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar public currency rate data provided within the “segment performance” section of this mda reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only 

  

venezuela related activities 

  

effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries prior to deconsolidation due to the country’s highly inflationary economy the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiaries was the us dollar as a result currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings across the second through fourth quarters of 2015 the venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 63 bolivares to 1 us dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar as noted above within our fixed currency sales and operating results to present our historical venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate we have reflected all venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 and 2014 reporting years at a simadi conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar 

  

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

  

acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and exclude the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods 

  

executive summary 

  

we continued to work aggressively through 2016s difficult environment where lackluster global economies significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued depressed energy market activity presented multiple headwinds to our growth we once again delivered superior results for customers at the lowest total operating cost to them while also working aggressively to deliver margin improvement we also continued to make significant investments in our customer field and infrastructure technology as well as in our talent management systems all key areas that will be critical to our longterm success 

  

in this environment our global institutional global industrial and other segments continued to show good fixed currency sales and earnings results however these were offset by a decline in the global energy segment coupled with significantly unfavorable currency translation due to the strong dollar appreciation relative to other currencies we worked aggressively to offset these headwinds while making progress in our work to strengthen our businesses and position them for better growth in 2017 

  

 

sales 

  

reported sales declined 3 to 132 billion in 2016 from 135 billion in 2015 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales were flat compared to the prior year see the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “net sales” table on page 30 and the “sales by reportable segment” table on page 36 for reconciliation information

earnings attributable to ecolab per common share “eps”   

  

reported diluted eps increased 25 to 414 in 2016 compared to 332 in 2015 special gains and charges had an impact on both years driven primarily by energy related charges in 2016 and venezuelan related actions restructuring charges and other gains and charges in both 2016 and 2015 also in 2015 special gains and charges included acquisition and integration related costs that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted diluted eps which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both 2016 and 2015 were flat at 437 in both 2016 and 2015 see the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the “diluted eps” table on page 35 for reconciliation information

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

  

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following  

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured we recognize revenue on services as they are performed while we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in note 17 

  

our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives at the time the sale is recorded we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts as discussed below depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive  

  

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates in addition our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits actual results could differ from these estimates 

  

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was 68 million and 75 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 14 million and 15 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 02 in 2016 2015 and 2014 we believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required  

  

for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2 

  

accrued liabilities 

  

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 

  

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position 

  

for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 15  

  

 

actuarially determined liabilities 

  

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

  

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses 

  

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table 

  



  



  



  



  

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans increased to 533 million as of december 31 2016 from 513 million as of december 31 2015 both before tax primarily due to current period net actuarial losses 

  

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2016 on the december 31 2016 funded status and 2017 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans  

  



  



  

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information 

  

 

see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations  

  

self insurance 

  

globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis 

  

restructuring 

  

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which typically is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet restructuring charges were substantially completed within our two active plans combined and energy during the fourth quarter of 2015 our restructuring liability balance was 40 million and 90 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

for additional information on our current restructuring activities see note 3  

  

income taxes 

  

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

effective income tax rate 

  

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances during interim periods this expected annual rate is then applied to our yeartodate operating results in the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period 

  

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

  

temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements 

  

during the first quarter of 2016 we earlyadopted the accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet using the prospective application method periods prior to the first quarter of 2016 have not been retrospectively adjusted for adoption of this guidance 

  

 

us deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings it is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns ecolab and nalco through 2012 the irs has completed examinations of our us federal income tax returns champion through 2011 and tax year 2012 is closed by statute of limitations our us federal income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions 

  

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 76 million and 75 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

for additional information on income taxes and adoption of new accounting guidance related to classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet see note 12 and note 2 respectively  

  

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

  

longlived and amortizable intangible assets 

  

we periodically review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was 64 billion and 65 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value   

  

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships 

  

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base our customer retention rate and history of maintaining longterm relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future additionally other less certain postacquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships if our customer retention rate or other postacquisition operational activities changed materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets 

  

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets 

  

goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 

  

we had total goodwill of 64 billion and 65 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our reporting units are aligned with our ten operating segments 

  

 

for our 2016 impairment assessment we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our ten reporting units through a quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow approach the twostep quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any our goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin we will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016 

  

as part of the nalco merger we added the “nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset the total value of which was 12 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing using a relief from royalty assessment method during the second quarter of 2016 based on this testing no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary additionally no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016 

  

  

results of operations 

  

net sales 

  



as shown in the table above foreign currency exchange negatively impacted sales growth during both 2016 and 2015 reporting years the percentage components of the yearoveryear sales change are shown below 

  

  



  

  

cost of sales “cos” and gross profit margin “gross margin” 

  



  

our cos values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales 

  

our reported gross margin was 475 467 and 462 for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our 2016 2015 and 2014 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of 660 million 806 million and 143 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the special gains and charges table on page 31 

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2016 adjusted gross margin was 480 compared against a 2015 adjusted gross margin of 473 the increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in global energy which on average has a lower gross margin  

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 473 and 463 for 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase was due primarily to delivered product cost savings and synergies 

  

 

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

  



  

the increased sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions investments in the business and the decline in global energy which on average has a lower sga ratio  

  

the consistent sga ratio comparing 2015 against 2014 resulted from the impact of net synergies and cost savings actions which were offset by investments in the business  

  

special gains and charges 

  

special gains and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items 



  

for segment reporting purposes special gains and charges are not allocated to reportable segments which is consistent with our internal management reporting 

  

restructuring activities 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3  

  

energy restructuring plan 

  

in april 2013 following the completion of the champion transaction we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other costsaving actions to realize our acquisitionrelated cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market the “energy restructuring plan” actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined business’s global workforce actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain including the reduction of plant distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization 

  

restructuring charges within the energy restructuring plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016 cumulative restructuring charges of 89 million 60 million after tax and net of the impact from noncontrolling interest are materially consistent with our initial expectation of 80 million 55 million after tax 

  

 

we recorded restructuring charges of 45 million 26 million after tax or 001 per diluted share 472 million 330 million after tax or 010 per diluted share and 95 million 64 million after tax or 002 per diluted share during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding energy restructuring charges we reflected 17 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income 

  

net cash payments under the energy restructuring plan were 144 million during 2016 and 425 million from 2013 through 2015 the majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters we anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities 

  

during 2016 the energy restructuring plan achieved approximately 25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015 cumulative cost savings from this plan along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition were approximately 150 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations 

  

combined restructuring plan 

  

in february 2011 we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our european business as well as undertake certain restructuring activities outside of europe historically referred to as the “2011 restructuring plan” additionally in january 2012 following the merger with nalco we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities including planned reductions of plant and distribution center locations historically referred to as the “merger restructuring plan” during the first quarter of 2013 we determined that the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned and consequently the previously separate restructuring plans were combined into one plan  

  

the combined restructuring plan the “combined plan” combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the merger restructuring plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities including reductions of the global workforce plant and distribution center locations 

  

restructuring charges within the combined plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016 cumulative restructuring charges of 391 million 297 million after tax are materially consistent with our initial expectation of 400 million 300 million after tax 

  

we recorded net gains of 136 million 134 million after tax or 005 per diluted share during 2016 primarily related to gains on the sale of certain facilities related to previous restructuring initiatives we recorded net charges of 530 million 442 million after tax or 015 per diluted share and 735 million 585 million after tax or 019 per diluted share during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

net cash payments under the combined plan were 149 million during 2016 and 3031 million from 2011 through 2015 the majority of cash payments under the combined plan are related to severance with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters we anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities 

  

during 2016 the combined plan achieved approximately 25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015 cumulative cost savings from this plan along with annual cost saving and synergies were approximately 420 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations 

  

nonrestructuring special gains and charges 

  

energy related charges 

  

oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry particularly in north america during the second and fourth quarters of 2016 as a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook we recorded total charges of 768 million 500 million after tax or 017 per diluted share comprised of inventory writedowns and related disposal costs fixed asset charges headcount reductions and other charges 

  

the inventory writedowns and related disposal costs of 405 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specificuse and other products coupled with declines in replacement costs as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory the fixed asset charges of 204 million resulted from the writedown of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our north american operations within the global energy segment as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction the carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero the employee termination costs of 131 million include a reduction in our global energy segment’s global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term as of the end of 2016 we had 74 million of corresponding severance remaining to be paid which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months and be funded from operating activities 

  

the charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

 

  

venezuela related activities 

  

effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016 we used the cost method of accounting for the investment in our venezuelan subsidiaries throughout 2016 as the conditions within venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016 prior to deconsolidation we remeasured our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water paper food  beverage institutional and the bolivar portion of our venezuelan operations within energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 63 bolivares to 1 us dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 us dollar as a result of the ownership structure of our food  beverage and institutional operations in venezuela we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income upon deconsolidation we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment the total charges during 2015 related to our actions in venezuela were 2893 million 2468 million after tax as a result of the ownership structure of our food  beverage and institutional operations in venezuela we reflected 111 million of the above charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income resulting in a net charge of 2357 million or 078 per diluted share 

  

during 2016 we recorded a gain of 78 million 49 million after tax or 002 per diluted share resulting from us dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation 

  

venezuela related charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income 

  

fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges 

  

during 2015 we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of 247 million 154 million after tax or 005 per diluted share consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our us plants the impaired facility is a specialized facility used for dry polymer production due to market contraction in the oil and the mining industries and the aggressive competitive pricing environment for dry polymers the facility has not reached production volumes to recover the value of the underlying fixed assets 

  

during 2016 we recorded an additional charge of 100 million 63 million after tax or 002 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment as well as related inventory charges subsequent to the charge the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets is less than 5 million inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products 

  

these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income 

  

inventory costs and inventory reserve 

  

during 2015 we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing resulting in a net pretax charge of approximately 6 million separately the actions resulted in a charge of 206 million 159 million after tax or 005 per diluted share related to inventory reserve calculations partially offset by a gain of 145 million 122 million after tax or 004 per diluted share related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory during 2016 we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory which resulted in a gain of 62 million 46 million after tax or 002 per diluted share 

  

these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income 

  

champion and nalco integration costs 

  

integration related special charges for the champion acquisition and nalco merger were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 and we did not incur any special charges related to such transactions during 2016 as a result of the champion acquisition and nalco merger we incurred charges of 187 million 120 million after tax or 005 per diluted share and 284 million 198 million after tax or 006 per diluted share during 2015 and 2014 respectively champion and nalco integration charges have been included as a component of special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

  

other special gains and charges 

  

during 2016 we recorded charges of 418 million 264 million after tax or 009 per diluted share primarily consisting of litigation related charges 

  

during 2015 we recorded a net charge of 563 million 345 million after tax or 011 per diluted share primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our ecovation business offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the champion transaction 

  

 

during 2014 we recorded a special gain of 284 million 233 million after tax or 008 per diluted share as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains the consolidation of the emirates national chemicals company llc “emochem” entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business 

  

the charges discussed above have been included as a component of special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

  

operating income and operating income margin 

  



  

our reported operating income increased 23 when comparing 2016 to 2015 and decreased 20 when comparing 2015 to 2014 our reported operating income for 2016 2015 and 2014 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2016 adjusted operating income decreased 2 when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income and 2015 adjusted operating income increased 1 when compared to 2014 adjusted operating income 

  

as shown in the previous table foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2016 and 2015 as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3 for 2016 and 8 for 2015 acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted our 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rates by approximately 1 percentage point in 2015 acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to fixed currency operating income growth 

  

as addressed further in the “segment performance” section of this mda comparisons across 2014 to 2016 were impacted by growth in global industrial global institutional and other offset by the continued challenges within global energy 

  

interest expense net 

  

reported net interest expense totaled 2646 million 2436 million and 2566 million during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in 2016 net interest expense compared to 2015 net interest expense was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt the decrease in 2015 net interest expense compared to 2014 net interest expense was driven primarily by lower weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt  

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate 

  



  

our reported tax rate for 2016 2015 and 2014 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall nongaap adjusted tax rate and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future 

  

our 2016 reported tax rate includes 431 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of 39 million associated with discrete tax items our 2015 reported tax rate includes 1057 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of 633 million associated with discrete tax items our 2014 reported tax rate includes 216 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of 132 million associated with discrete tax items the corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above 

 

  

during 2016 we recognized net expenses related to discrete tax items of 39 million the net expenses were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 us federal income tax return partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in nonus jurisdictions 

  

net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of 206 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of 390 million for the tax basis in a whollyowned domestic subsidiary 

  

net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2014 were driven primarily by an update to noncurrent tax liabilities for certain global tax audits an adjustment related to the recharacterization of intercompany payments between our us and foreign affiliates the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 us federal and state tax returns net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements 

  

the decrease in our adjusted tax rate from 2014 to 2016 was impacted by global tax planning projects as well as favorable geographic income mix future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to us domestic tax reform proposals further tax planning projects and geographic income mix

amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding 

  

net sales

financial position cash flow and liquidity 

  

financial position 

  

total assets were 183 billion as of december 31 2016 compared to total assets of 186 billion as of december 31 2015 the decrease in assets was driven primarily by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into us dollars as of year end 2016 and 2015 the impact of adopting the accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as discussed in note 2 and the impact of intangible asset amortization 

  

total liabilities were 114 billion as of december 31 2016 compared to total liabilities of 117 billion as of december 31 2015 total debt was 67 billion as of december 31 2016 and 65 billion as of december 31 2015 see further discussion of our debt activity within the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda 

  

our net debt to ebitda and net debt to adjusted ebidta are shown in the following table ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap measures which are discussed further in the “nongaap financial measures” section of this mda 

  



  

cash flows 

  

operating activities 



  

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in the business debt repayments and pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases 

  

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by f luctuations in accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable “working capital” the combination of which increased 35 million 119 million and 212 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the cash flow impact across the three years from accounts receivable was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections the cash flow impact across the three years from inventories was impacted by timing of purchases and production and usage levels and from accounts payable was impacted by volume of purchases and timing of payments 

  

the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions cash activity related to restructuring cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table   

  



 

  

investing activities 



  

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business 

  

total cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions in 2016 2015 and 2014 was 49 million 265 million and 72 million respectively our acquisitions and divestitures across 2016 2015 and 2014 are discussed further in note 4 we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our longterm growth 

  

we continue to make capital investments in the business including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities total capital expenditures including software were 757 million 815 million and 794 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

comparability of cash used for investing activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by other factors including the following 

  







  

  

financing activities 



  

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt common stock repurchases proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs dividend payments and acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

  

our 2016 debt financing activities included the issuance of €575 million 100 750 million 270  250 million 370 400 million 200 and 400 million 325 fixed rate senior notes the scheduled repayment of our 125 billion 300 and €175 million 4585 senior notes and repayment of the remaining 125 million of our term loan borrowings net issuances and repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of 606 million during 2016 

  

our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of 300 million 155 300 million 225 and €575 million 2625 fixed rate senior notes the scheduled repayment of our 250 million 4875 and 500 million 100 senior notes and repayment of 275 million of term loan borrowings net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of 312 million during 2015 

  

our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of 400 million of term loan borrowings and the scheduled repayment of our 500 million 2375 senior notes net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of 600 million during 2014 

  

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders 

  

in february 2015 we announced a 10 billion share repurchase program which was completed during the second quarter of 2016  we repurchased a total of 740 million and 755 million of shares in 2016 and 2015 respectively these amounts include 300 million of shares repurchased through the asr program in both 2016 and 2015 respectively s ee note 10 for further information regarding our asr programs during 2014 we repurchased 429 million of shares cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity 

  

in december 2016 we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 6 this represents the 25th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 80 consecutive years cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows  

  



  

 

financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisitionrelated contingent consideration payment of 86 million made to champion’s former shareholders  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2017 including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension contributions with cash from operating activities and as needed additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong 

  

as of december 31 2016 we had 327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which 184 million was held outside of the us 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had 26 million of deferred tax liabilities for preacquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy nalco entities and legacy champion entities that we intended to repatriate these liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction the remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016 reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at december 31 2016 

  

we consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds we continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations to the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by foreign tax credits both in the us and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions 

  

as of december 31 2016 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in december 2019 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2016 or 2015 

  

the credit facility supports our 20 billion us commercial paper program and 20 billion european commercial paper program we increased the european commercial paper program from 200 million during the third quarter of 2016 combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed 20 billion as of december 31 2016 we had no amount outstanding under either our us or european commercial paper programs 

  

additionally we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of 746 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs including with respect to bank supported letters of credit performance bonds and guarantees approximately 554 million of these credit lines were available for use as of yearend 2016 

  

as of december 31 2016 our shortterm borrowing program was rated a2 by standard  poor’s and p2 by moody’s 

as of december 31 2016 standard  poor’s and moody’s rated our longterm credit at a stable outlook and baa1 stable outlook respectively a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities should this occur we could seek additional sources of funding including issuing additional term notes or bonds in addition we have the ability at our option to draw upon our 20 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination 

  

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures 

  

a schedule of our obligations as of december 31 2016 under various notes payable longterm debt agreements operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table  

  



  

interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at yearend 2016 

  

as of december 31 2016 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was 76 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

 

we are not required to make any contributions to our us pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2017 based on plan asset values as of december 31 2016 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate 42 million in 2017 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles 

  

except for the approximately 192 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases as discussed further in note 13 we do not participate in offbalance sheet financing arrangements through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships  

  

market risk 

  

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk and ongoing monitoring and reporting and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2016 we had a total of €1150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges 

  

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2016 we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of 1450 million 

  

see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity 

  

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increasedecrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately 50 million the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items  

  

global economic and political environment 

  

energy markets 

  

during 2016 approximately 23 of our sales were generated from global energy the results of which as noted further below are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets 

  

oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry particularly in north america we also experienced additional pricing headwinds in 2016 when compared to 2015 as a result of these conditions we recorded charges related to inventory writedowns and related disposal costs fixed asset charges employee termination costs and other charges during the second and fourth quarters of 2016 as discussed further in note 3 

  

demand for oil and overall energy consumption has remained consistent 

  

our global footprint and broad business portfolio within global energy as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market as such we continue to remain confident in the longterm growth prospects of the segment 

  

as petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products lower oil prices provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs 

 

  

global economies 

  

approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results 

  

brexit referendum 

  

the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union “brexit” resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies 

  

brexit is nonbinding however if passed into law negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the european union the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union in the longer term any impact from brexit on our uk operations will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations 

  

during 2016 net sales of our uk operations were approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales 

  

global foreign currency markets 

  

the us dollar remained strong against most global currencies during 2016 when compared against both 2015 and 2014 levels impacting our comparative results as described in note 8 we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures and our investments in foreign operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 

  

subsequent events

additional information 

  

international operations   

  

we directly operate in approximately 90 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a join t venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

  

  

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic an d political conditions the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size  and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competitio n 

  

in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring services and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional and other segments have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our global energy segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product and service quality technical expertise chemical formulations and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership 

  

sales 

  

products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatme nt and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found above

we sold one class of products within the global institutional segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in two of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 10 of consolidated net sales in both 2015 and 2013 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

we own and license a number of patents trademarks an d other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by f iling for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents related to our trasar and 3d trasar technology which are material to our water and paper segments and trademarks related to ecolab nalco and 3d trasar the ecolab trademarks are material to the global industrial global institutional and other segments and the nalco trademarks are material to the water paper and energy businesses the 3d trasar trademarks predominantly relate to our water and paper segments us and foreign patents protect aspects of our key trasar and 3d trasar technology until at least 2024 the ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations 

  

our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks ar e inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean ‑up fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

 

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in recent years have been considered by sev eral other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states including california and new york are considering fur ther regulations in this area the california safer consumer products act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe””safer choice” program dfesafer choice has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfesafer choice label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our global institutional and global industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformula tion or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory were passed by both chambers of t he us congress and final enactment of legislation is likely to occur in the first half of 2016 the us environmental protection agency “epa” also is more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018 to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product line s and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements in addition korea taiwan and other countries are planning similar requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels an d safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels we met the 2015 deadlines in the us and european union and are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation in other countries potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pestic ides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires reg istration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different f rom those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to 

 

increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our pest elimination business applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration fda however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulatio ns for overthecounter antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda fda regulations associated with the food safety modernization act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device and drug manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing t esting and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medi cal devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

other environmental legislation capital expenditures  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances   the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances i nto the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201219eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmen tal sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 55 million in 2015 and 53 million in 2014 approximately  67 million has been budgeted globally for project s in 2016 the increase in 2016 over 2015 is due to continued spending on process safety matters throughout the company including facilities acquired in connection with the champion transaction 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of gre enhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg 

 

emissions while sustai ning economic growth  we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and have made significant strides in recent years in 2014 we received a climate leadership award cosponsored by epa recognizing ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 125 percent 224 percent intensity reduction 

  

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2014 they include a 25 percent reduction in effluent discharge and waste a 20 percent reduction in water use and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2017 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than 13 million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services these actions directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the demand for energy 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean ‑up activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 23 sites in the united s tates additionally we have similar liability at nine sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” issued a notice of enforcement “noe” and notice of violation “nov” related to ecolab’s facility in fresno tx on august 29 2014 alleging violations of the facility’s air permits and various state and federal air laws we have provided information to the tceq regarding the alleged violations and met with them to discuss our response to the nov and noe and the corrective actions already implemented on june 24 2015 the tceq issued a draft consent decree to ecolab for certain violations and the tceq is now seeking an administrative penalty of approximately 09 million we anticipate that this matter will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future  and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection w ith our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 65 million in 2015 and 50 million in 2014 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2015 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements tota led approximately 26 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

without limiting the foregoing words or phrases such as “will likely result” “are expected to” “will continue” “is anticipated” “we believe” “we expect” “estimate” “project” including the negative or variations thereof or similar terminology generally identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements may also repre sent challenging goals for us these statements which represent the company’s expectations or beliefs concerning various future events are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forwardlooking statements we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on such forwardlooking statements which s peak only as of the date made some of the factors which could cause results to differ from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement are set forth under item 1a of this form 10k entitled risk factors except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking stat ements made in this form 10k see the section entit led forwardlooking statements set forth above 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 

  

e conomic downturns and in particular downturns in the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers the well completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices in 2015 the global energy segment experienced a decrease in sales as a result of challenging global energy market conditions in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe and emerging markets such as china and brazil has negatively im pacted many of our endmarkets weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such cycles these endusers may reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business   

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors    

  

economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of th e euro versus the us dollar other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency ri sk for example as more fully described in the mda located in item 7 of part ii of this form 10k continued deteriorating economic conditions and currency exchange control regulations have resulted in a charge of 1234 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries this charge was preceded by charges of 1659 million 1548 million including the impact of 111 million within net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest through the first three quarters of 2015 related to venezuela bolivar’s devaluation similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business 

  

our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sale s management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue the integration of new businesses which may be led by personnel that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason we were unable to attract or retain such officers or key employees  

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  

  

in addition to the energy restructuring plan and combined restructuring plan discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” of this form 10k  we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our effi ciency and returns in particular we continue to invest in our erp systems to integrate and streamline our processes and t o improve our competitiveness these initiatives involve complex business process design and a breakdown in certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security 

  

we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown maliciou s intrusion and random attack recent acquisitions including the nalco and champion transactions have resulted in further decentralization of systems a nd additional complexity in our systems infrastructure likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthor ized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems that could cause reputational damage business disruption and legal and regulatory costs could result in thirdparty claims could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property trade secrets and sensitive information and could otherwise adversely affect our business 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability 

  

we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2015 approximately 48 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  





























  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us and international econo mic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compl iance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political condition s we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  

  

our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally includ ing employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for l iability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense o f compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we are a defendant in five wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the fair labor standards act “ flsa” or a similar state law while we have settled one wage hour case during the past year  namely cancilla v ecolab inc us district court – northern district of 

 

california case no cv 1203001 and obtained summary judgment in ecolab’s favor on flsa claims in another – namely charlot v ecolab inc us district court – eastern district of new york case no cv 1204543  there can be no assurance that other pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs 

  

our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetar y damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” were named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

all but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with ot her related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” the remaining case was franks v sea tow of south miss inc et al cause no a240210228 circuit court of harrison county mississippi the franks case was dismissed in may 2014 

  

nalco company  the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have   been named as third party defendants   by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no  2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims again st nalco because claims remain pending against other defendants the court’s decision is not a “final jud gment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment t o appeal the court’s decision we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the po tential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  

  

our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local compet itors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche a pplications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  

  

the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows  in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

we have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents of approximately 6 4 billion  our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position  including in the following respects 

  

 











  

in addition as of december 31 2015 approximately  22 billion of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approx imately 22 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected    

  

as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acq uire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results 

  

our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms aff ecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results 

  

customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent year s and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business 

  

our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as zika virus avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions 

  

ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and th is expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period durin g which the write down occurs as of december 31 2015 we had goodwill of 65 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from t h e   nal c o   a n d   ch ampi o n   tr an sa c t i o n s which r es u l t e d   i n   t h e ad d i t i o n   o f   4  5   b ill i o n   a n d   1  0   b ill i o n   o f goo dwil l    r es pe c t i v e l y if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

 

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business  

  

as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transporta tion storage or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  

  

the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the a ffected earnings periods 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

  

the following management discussion and analysis “mda” provides information that we believe is useful in understanding the operating results cash flows and financial condition of ecolab inc “ecolab” “the company” “we” or “our” we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate level and the quantitative impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the segment level we also provide quantitative information regarding special gains and charges discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance 

  

the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes included in this form 10k our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” this discussion contains various “nongaap financial measures” and also contains various “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “ nongaap financial measures ”   at the end of this mda and “ forwardlooking statements ” and “ risk factors ”   within items 1 and 1a of this form 10k  

  

comparability of results 

  

fixed currency foreign exchange rates 

  

we evaluate the sales and operating income performance of our nonus dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management with all periods presented using such rates fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established 

  

impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

  

2015 versus 2014 

  

to provide a more meaningful periodoverperiod comparison our 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition exclude the results of the divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and exclude our venezuelan results of operations from both 2015 and 2014 

  

2014 versus 2013 

  

on april 10 2013 we completed our acquisition of privately held champion technologies and its related company corsicana technologies collectively “champion” the champion business became part of our global energy reportable segment in the second quarter of 2013 the pro forma impact of the champion acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements therefore pro forma information is not presented 

  

specific to the champion transaction due to the rapid pace at which the business has been integrated within our global energy segment including all customer selling activity discrete financial data specific to the legacy champion business is no longer available for postacquisition periods as such to allow for a more meaningful 2014 versus 2013 comparison specific to the champion transaction champion’s results for the period prior to acquisition in 2013 have been included for purposes of providing acquisition adjusted growth rates all other acquisitions and divestitures continue to be handled consistent with the mechanics described in the 2015 versus 2014 discussion above the 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates do not exclude the venezuelan results of operations from either 2014 or 2013 

  

  

executive summary 

  

in 2015 we delivered midsingle digit adjusted earnings p er share growth in spite of decline s in the energy and emerging markets and significant currency headwinds including the devaluation of our venezuela n   bolivares fuertes “ bolivar ” businesses throughout 2015  our global institutional global industrial and other segments delivered strong results which more than offset weaker global energy results w e continued to drive positive adjusted fixed currency operating growth and margin trends through product cost savings synergies and appropriate pricing 

  

through our focused actions we once again delivered superior operating results for our shareholders in 2015 while continuing to build our future opportunities our performance underscored the strength and longterm potential of our business o ur people and our strategies 

  

 

sales 

  

reported sales declined 5  to  135 billion in 2015 from 143 billion in 2014 sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange fixed currency sales increased 1  compared to the prior year see the section entitled nongaap financial measures within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the net sales table on page 32 and the sales by reportable segment table on page 39 for reconciliation information 

  

gross margin 

  

our reported gross margin was 467  of sales for 2015 which compared to 2014 reported gross margin of 462 excluding the impact of special gains and charges included in cost of sales from both 2015 and 2014 our adjusted gross margin was 473  in 2015 and 463 in 2014 see the section entitled nongaap financial measures within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the cost of sales and gross margin table on page 33 for reconciliation information  

  

operating income 

  

reported operating income decreased 20  to  16 billion in 2015 compared to 20 billion in 2014 adjusted operating income excluding the impact of special gains and charges increased 1  in 2015 when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange a djusted fixed currency operating income increased 7  see the section entitled nongaap financial measures within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the operating income table on page 37 and operating income by reportable segment table on page 39 for reconciliation information  

  

earnings per share   

  

reported diluted earnings per share decreased 16  to  332 in 2015 compared to 393 in 2014 special gains and charges had an impact on both years driven primarily by venezuelan related actions in 2015 and restructuring charges acquisition and integration related costs and other gains and charges in both 2015 and 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share which exclude the impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both 2015 and 2014 increased 5  to  437 in 2015 compared to 418 in 2014 see the section entitled nongaap financial measures within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the diluted earnings attributable to ecolab per common share table on page 38 for reconciliation information  

  

balance sheet 

  

we remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet supported by our current credit rating s of bbbbaa1 by the major ratings agencies and to achieving “a” range ratings metrics we believe that our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates 

  

net debt to ebitda 

  

our net debt to   earnings before interest taxes  depreciation and amortization “ebitda” was 26 and 22 for 2015 and 2014 respectively our net debt to a djusted ebitda  defined as the sum of ebitda and special gains and charges impacting ebitda  w as 22 for both 2015 and 2014  we view these measures as an important indicator of our creditworthiness and demonstrates our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt se e the section entitled nongaap financial measures within this mda for further information on our nongaap measures and the net debt to ebitda table on page 42 for reconciliation information 

  

cash flow 

  

cash flow from operating activities was  20 billion in 2015 compared to 18 billion in 2014 we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments in our business debt repayments pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments see the section entitled cash flows within this mda for further information 

  

dividends 

  

we increase d our quarterly cash dividend 6  in december 2015 to an indicated annual rate of 140 per share the increase represents our 24 th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 79th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development strong cash flows solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead 

  

restructuring initiatives 

  

restructuring charges were substantially completed during 2015 under our two open restructuring plans the combined plan and the energy restructuring plan the plans were commenced in 2011 and 2013 respectively to reduce our global workforce leverage and simplify our supply chain reduce our distribution center locations and other facilities and strengthen our position in the global energy market see the section entitled restructuring charges within this mda for further information 

  

 

venezuela activities 

  

as a result of the increasing currency controls importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements  we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016 this action coupled with the devaluations of our venezuelan water and paper businesses during the second quarter of 2015 and our   venezuelan food  beverage and institutional and bolivar portion of our venezuelan energy businesses during the third quarter of 2015 resulted in a total charge of  2893 million  2468 million after tax  and 2357 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest during 2015  

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “notes” 

  

preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and 2 different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period have a material impact on the presentation of the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

  

besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures all estimates whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known even from estimates not deemed critical our critical accounting estimates include the following  

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured we recognize revenue on services as they are performed while we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in note 17  

  

our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives at the time the sale is recorded we also record estimated reserves for anticipated uncollectible accounts and for product returns and credits at the time of sale as discussed below depending on market conditions we may increase customer incentive offerings which could reduce gross profit margins at the time the incentive is offered  

  

valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical writeoff and collection trend rates in addition our estimates also include separately providing for customer balances based on specific circumstances and credit conditions and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 

  

our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  75 million and 77 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of 15 million as of both december 31 2015 and 2014  our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 02  in 2015  2014 and 2013 we believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payments or if unexpected events economic downturns or significant changes in future trends were to occur additional allowances may be required  

  

 

accrued liabilities 

  

our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use and handling of hazardous substances waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 

  

we record liabilities related to pending litigation environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is probable while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position 

  

for additional information on our commitments and contingencies see note 15  

  

actuarially determined liabilities 

  

pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans 

  

the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses 

  

the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate expected return on assets projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table 

  



  



  



  



  

the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions as well as changes in assumptions are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and therefore will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations the unrecognized net actuarial loss on our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased to  513 million as of december 31 2015 from 556 million as of december 31 2014 both before tax primarily due to amortization of prior year net actuarial losses  

  

 

the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31 2015 on the december 31 2015 funded status and 2016 expense is shown below assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant us plans  

  



  



  

our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans with the majority of the amounts held in the uk and eurozone countries we use assumptions similar to our us plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations however the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information 

  

see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies estimates funded status contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations  

  

self insurance 

  

globally we have high deductible insurance policies for property and casualty losses we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles we are selfinsured for health care claims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis a change in th ese actuarial assumptions would have an immaterial impact to   our reported results  

  

restructuring 

  

our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses these restructuring plans include costs associated with significant actions involving employeerelated severance charges contract termination costs and asset writedowns and disposals employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance benefits and outplacement services these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable which is when management approves the associated actions contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs asset writedowns and disposals include leasehold improvement writedowns other asset writedowns associated with combining operations and disposal of assets 

  

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset writedowns associated with combining operations restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet during 2015 we incurred approximately  100 million under our two active plans combined and energy restructuring charges were substantially completed within both plans during the fourth quarter of 2015 our restructuring liability balance was  90 million and 76 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

for additional information on our current restructuring activities see note 3  

  

income taxes 

  

judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate deferred tax assets and liabilities any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 

  

 

effective income tax rate 

  

our effective income tax rate is based on annual income statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances during interim periods this expected annual rate is then applied to our yeartodate operating results in the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period 

  

tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements as a result the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary differences such as depreciation expense 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances 

  

temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements 

  

us deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings it is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed 

  

uncertain tax positions 

  

a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns ecolab and nalco through 2012 to date the 2012 us income tax return of champion has not been audited our ecolab us federal including nalco and champion income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit in addition to the us federal examinations we have ongoing audit activity in several us state and foreign jurisdictions 

  

the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal state and international jurisdictions we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the morelikelythannot thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year taking into account new legislation regulations case law and audit results settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts cash payments or receipts andor adjustments to tax expense the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet within other noncurrent liabilities our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was  7 5 million and 79 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

for additional information on income taxes see note 12  

  

longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill 

  

longlived and intangible assets 

  

we periodically review our longlived and amortizable intangible assets the net value of which was  65 billion and 6 6 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded if any is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value   

  

during 2015 as part of the actions taken regarding our venezuelan businesses we wroteoff customer relationship intangible assets and other longlived assets see note 3 for additional information regarding venezuela   also during 2015 we impaired certain longlived assets related to a product line within one of our us plants see note 3 for additional information regarding this asset impairment 

 

we use the straightline method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets including our customer relationships we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships including projected sales data customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships 

  

globally we have a broad customer base our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships our historical retention rate coupled with our consistent track record of keeping longterm relationships with our customers supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base our customer retention rate and history of maintaining longterm relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future additionally other less certain postacquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships if our customer retention rate or other postacquisition operational activities changed materially we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets 

  

in addition we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived and amortizable intangible assets changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our longlived or amortizable intangible assets 

  

as part of the nalco merger we added the “nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset the total value of which was 12 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing using the qualitative assessment method during the second quarter of 2015 based on this testing no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary additionally n o events during the second half of 2015 indicated a need to update to our concl us ions reached during the second quarter of 2015  

  

goodwill 

  

we had total goodwill of  65 billion and 67 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we test our goodwill for impairment at the operating unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter our operating units are aligned with our ten operating segments 

  

for our 2015 impairment assessment in order to refresh the estimated fair value of all ten of our operating units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative test the twostep quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each operating unit to the operating unit’s carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a n   operating unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the operati ng unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of the operating unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any 

  

our goodwill impairment assessment for 2015 indicated the fair value of each of our   operating units exceeded their respective carrying amount by a significant margin if circumstances change significantly we would also test a n   operating unit’s goodwill for impairment during interim periods between our annual tests as a result of the venezuela deconsolidation we updated our goodwill impairment assessment for the global energy reportable segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 which indicated no impairment and a continued significant margin of fair value exceeding carrying value 

  

results of operations 

  

net sales 

  



  

reported net sales for 2015 decreased 5  negatively impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation f ixed currency sales increased 1  in 2015 

  

reported net sales for 2014 increased 8 with growth benefiting from the champion acquisition foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales growth in 2014 as fixed currency sales increased 9 acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5  in 2014 

  

 

the percentage change components of the yearoveryear sales increase are as follows  

  



  

note amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding 

  

cost of sales “cos” and gross margin 

  



  

our cos values and corresponding gross profit margin “gross margin” are shown in the previous table our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales 

  

our reported gross margin was 467  462 and 460 for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our 2015 2014 and 2013 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special gains and charges of  806 million 143 million and 432 million respectively special gains and charges items impacting cos are shown within the special gains and charges table on page 34  

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our 2015 adjusted gross margin was 473 compared against a 2014 adjusted gross margin of 463 the increase was due primarily to delivered product cost savings and synergies 

  

excluding the impact of special gains and charges our adjusted gross margin was 463 for both 2014 and 2013 the adjusted gross margin across 2014 and 2013 was impacted by the growth within global energy including the impact of the champion acquisition which generally has a lower gross margin compared to our other segments which offset pricing gains 

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” 

  



  

the consistent sga ratio sga expenses as a percentage of reported net sales comparing 2015 against 2014 resulted f rom the impact of net synergies and cost savings actions which were offset by investments in the business   

  

the reduction in sga ratio when comparing 2014 against 2013 resulted from increased sales leverage net synergies and cost savings actions  

  

 

special gains and charges 

  

special gains and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items 

  



  

for segment reporting purposes special gains and charges have been included in our corporate segment which is consistent with our internal management reporting  

  

restructuring charges 

  

energy restructuring plan 

  

in april 2013 following the completion of the acquisition of champion we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other costsaving actions to realize our acquisitionrelated cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market the “energy restructuring plan” actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined business’s current global workforce actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain including the reduction of plant distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization 

  

restructuring charges within the energy restructuring plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 certain immaterial actions may continue into 2016 ongoing cash payments will continue into 2016 cumulative restructuring charges of  82 million  59 million after tax are materially consistent with our expectation of 80 million 55 million after tax 

  

we recorded restructuring charges of  472 million  330 million after tax  313 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest or 01 0 per diluted sha re 95 million 64 million after tax or 002 per diluted share and 274 million 194 million after tax or 006 per diluted share during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding energy restructuring charges we reflected 17 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income 

  

net cash payments under the energy restructuring plan were  111 million during 2015 and 314 million from 2013 through 2014 the majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters we anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities 

  

during 2015 the energy restructuring plan achieved approximately  45 million of incremental savings as compared to 2014 cumulative cost savings from this plan along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition were 125 million in 2015 we anticipate annualized cumulative cost savings and synergies of 150 million by the end of 2016 

  

 

restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales  special gains and charges and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3 

  

combined restructuring plan 

  

in february 2011 we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our european business as well as to undertake certain restructuring activities outside of europe historically referred to as the “2011 restructuring plan” additionally in january 2012 and following the merger with nalco we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities including planned reduction of plant and distribution center locations historically referred to as the “merger restructuring plan” during the first quarter of 2013 we determined that because the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned the previously separate restructuring plans should be combined into one plan 

  

the combined restructuring plan the “combined plan” combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the merger restructuring plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities including reductions of the global workforce plant and distribution center locations 

  

restructuring charges within the combined plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 certain immaterial actions may continue into 2016 ongoing cash payments will continue into 2016 cumulative restructuring charges of  404 million  310 million after tax are materially consistent with our expectation of 400 million 300 million after tax

venezuela 

  

as of the end of 2015 the increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars through off icial currency exchange markets have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this has significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our venezuelan businesses including restrictions on the ability of our venezuelan businesses to settle us dollardenominated obligat ions the currency controls coupled with importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements have significantly influenced our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our businesses in venezuela t he inability of our venezuelan businesses to pay dividends which remain subject to venezuelan government approvals has continued to re strict   our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our venezue lan businesses we expect the conditions described above will continue for the foreseeable future further during the fourth quarter of 2015 given our high level of intercompany receivables we pursued cash basis transactions to limit additional investment 

  

as a result of these factors we concluded that effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not meet the us gaap accounting criteria for control over our venezuelan subsidiaries therefore we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016  this action resulted in a charge of  1234 million  809 million after tax or 0 27 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values resulting in a full impairment the fourth quarter 2015 charge included 85 million of intercompany receivables as well as net assets of our venezuelan businesses and accumulated foreign currency 

  

the decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan subsidiaries was preceded by the remeasurement of our venezuelan water and paper net assets   during the second quarter of 2015 at the marginal currency system “ simadi ” exchange rate and the remeasurement of our venezuelan food  beverage and institutional net assets and bolivar portion of our venezuelan energy net assets at the simadi exchange rate during the third quarter of 2015  the combination of these actions resulted in charges of 1 659 million 1 659 million after tax through the first three quarters of 2015 as a result o f the ownership structure of our food  beverage and institutional operations in venezuela we reflected 111 million of the above charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income  resulting in a net charge of 1548 million  

  

the total charges during 2015 related to our actions in venezuela were  2893 million  2468 million after tax 2357 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest or 0 78 per share 

  

on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency from 43 bolivares to 1 us dollar to 63 bolivars to 1 us dollar resulting in a charge during 2013 of 227 million 161 million after tax or 005 per diluted share due to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet 

  

other special gains and charges 

  

during 2015 we recorded a charge of 247 million 154 million after tax or 005 per diluted share related to a fixed asset impairment consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our us plants resulting from lower than anticipated production also during 2015 we improved estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing resulting in a net pretax charge of approximately 6 million separately the actions resulted in a charge of 206 million 159 million after tax or 005 per diluted share related to inventory reserve calculations partially offset by a gain of 145 million 122 million after tax or 004 per diluted share related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income 

  

also d uring 2015 we recognized a net charge of  563 million  345 million after tax or 011 per diluted share   primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our ecovation business offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the champion transaction the net charges have been included as a component of special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income 

  

during 2014 we recorded a special gain of 284 million 233 million after tax or 008 per diluted share as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains the consolidation of the emirates national chemicals company llc “emochem” entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business   the net charges have been included as a component of special gains and charges on the consolidated statement of income

operating income and operating income margin 

  



  

reported operating income decreased 20  when comparing 2015 to 2014 and increased 25 when comparing 2014 to 2013 our reported operating income for 2015 2014 and 2013 was impacted by special gains and charges excluding the impact of special gains and charges from all three years 2015 adjusted operating income increased 1  when compared to 2014 adjusted operating income and 2014 adjusted operating income increased 15 when compared to 2013 adjusted operating income as shown in the previous table foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2015 and 2014 as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 7  for 2015 and 17 for 2014 

  

the 2015 adjusted fixed currency operating income increase and the improving adjusted fixed currency operating margin trend was driven by delivered product cost savings and synergies which more than offset investment in the business and other costs   

  

the 2014 adjusted fixed currency operating income increase and the improving adjusted fixed currency operating margin trend was driven by sales volume increases pricing gains net cost savings and synergies the impact of acquisitions and divestitures added approximately 2 percentage points to our 2014 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rate  

  

interest expense net 

  



  

reported net interest expense totaled  2436 million 2566 million and 2623 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

special gains and charges reported within net interest expense in 2013 included the interest expense of our 500 million public debt issuance in december 2012   through the april 2013 close date of the champion acquisition as well as amortizable fees to secure term loans and shortterm debt all of which were initiated to fund the champion acquisition 

  

the decrease in 2015 net interest expense compared to 2014 net interest expense was driven primarily by lower interest rates paid on outstanding debt the decrease in 2014 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2013 adjusted net interest expense was due primarily to lower comparable outstanding debt offset partially by increased net expense related to our foreign currency hedging program and other interestrelated fees  

  

provision for income taxes 

  

the following table provides a summary of our tax rate 

  



  

our reported tax rate for 2015 2014 and 2013 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items depending on the nature of our special gains and charges and discrete tax items our reported tax rate may not be consistent on a period to period basis as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall nongaap adjusted tax rate 

 

our 2015 reported tax rate includes  1057 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of  633 million associated with discrete tax items our 2014 reported tax rate includes 216 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of 132 million associated with discrete tax items our 2013 reported tax rate includes 601 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of 417 million associated with discrete tax items the corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above 

  

net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of 206 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of 390 million for the tax basis in a whollyowned domestic subsidiary  

  

net expense related to discrete tax items in 2014 was driven primarily by an update to noncurrent tax liabilities for certain global tax audits an adjustment related to the recharacterization of intercompany payments between our us and foreign affiliates the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 us federal and state tax returns net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements 

  

net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2013 were driven primarily by the net release of valuation allowances related to the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets of 115 million the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities of 113 million and recognizing adjustments from filing our 2012 us federal and state tax returns of 110 million the remaining net discrete tax items relate primarily to recognizing settlements related to prior year income tax audits law changes within a foreign jurisdiction the retroactive extension during first quarter 2013 of the us rd credit for 2012 foreign audit adjustments and other adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

the decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate from 2013 to 2015 was impact ed   by global tax planning projects the decrease in our 2014 adjusted effective tax rate compared to 2013 was also impacted by favorable geographic income mix  

  

net income attributable to ecolab 

  



  

diluted earnings attributable to ecolab per common share eps 

  



  

note per share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding 

  

reported net income attributable to ecolab totaled  10021 million 12028 million and 9678 million during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively which resulted in reported diluted earnings per share of  332  393 and 316 for the corresponding periods 

  

amounts for 2015 2014 and 2013 include special gains and charges and discrete tax items excluding special gains and charges and the impact of discrete tax items from 2015 2014 and 2013 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3  and 5  respectively when comparing 2015 to 2014 and both increased 18 when comparing 2014 to 2013 

  

currency translation has had significant unfavorable impact on reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share comparability across 2013 to 2015 with headwinds of approximately  03 0 per share for 2015 compared to 2014 and approximately 007 per share for 2014 compared to 2013

global energy 

  



  

net sales

cash flows 

  

operating activities 



  

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations acquisitions investments i n the business debt repayments and pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases 

  

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2013 to 2015 was impacted by various factors including the following 

  



  



  



  

pension and postretirement plan contributions cash activity related to restructuring cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest are shown in the following table 

  



  

investing activities 



  

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business 

  

total cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions in 2015 2014 and 2013 was  265 million 72 million and 14 billion respectively the champion acquisition accounted for 13 billion of the net cash p aid for acquisitions in 2013 our acquisitions and divestitures across 2015 2014 and 2013 are discussed further in note 4   we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our longterm growth 

  

we continue to make capital investments in the business including process control and monitoring equipment equipment used by our customers to dispense our products and manufacturing facilities total capital expenditures including software were  815 million 794 million and 662 million in 201 5 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

investing related cash flows in 2015 were also impacted by settlement of a net investment hedge and receipt of champion related escrow funds  

  

financing activities 



  

 

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt common stock repurchases proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs dividend payments and acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

  

our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of 300 million 155 300 million 225 and €575 million 263 fixed rate senior notes the scheduled repayment of our 250 million 488 and 500 million 100 senior notes and repayment of 275 million of term loan borrowings net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of  312 million during 2015 

  

our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of 400 million of term loan borrowings over the course of 2014 and the scheduled repayment of our 500 million 238 senior notes net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of 600 million during 2014 

  

our 2013 debt financing activities included 900 million of term loan borrowings initiated in connection with the champion transaction the scheduled repayment of our €125 million series a notes 170 million in december 2013 the redemption of debt acquired through the champion transaction and repayment of 100 million of term loan borrowings net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash outflow of 278 million during 2013 

  

shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions and to efficiently return capital to shareholders 

  

in february 2015 we announced a 10 billion share repurchase program of which  382 million remains to be repurchased as of december 31 2015 we expect the program to be completed by mid2016 during 2015 we repurchased a total of  755 million of shares which includes 300 million of shares through the asr program discussed further in note 10 during 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 429 million and 308 million of shares respectively cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity 

  

in december 2015 we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 6 this represents the 24th consecutive year we have increased our dividend we have paid dividends on our common stock for 79 consecutive years cash dividends declared per share of common stock by quarter for each of the last three years were as follows  

  



  

comparability of dividends paid across 2013 to 2015 was impacted by the dividend rate increase noted in the above table as well as the payment timing of dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 

  

financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisitionrelated contingent consideration payment of 86 million made to champion’s former shareholders  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2016 including scheduled debt repayments new investments in the business share repurchases dividend payments possible business acquisitions and pension contributions with cash from operating activities cash reserves available in certain foreign jurisdictions and additional shortterm andor longterm borrowings we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had  928 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand of which  883 million was held outside of the us 

  

we have recorded deferred tax liabilities of  258 million and 374 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively for preacquisition foreign earnings associated with the nalco merger and champion acquisition that we intend to repatriate these liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction we consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds we continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations to the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by fore ign tax credits both in the u s and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had a 20 billion multiyear credit facility which expires in december 2019 the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31 2015 and 2014 

  

the credit facility supports our 20 billion us commercial paper program and 200 million european commercial paper program combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed 20 billion as of december 31 2015 we had  605 million in outstanding us commercial paper with an average annual interest rate of 07  and no amounts outstanding under our european commercial paper program as of december 31 2015 both programs were rated a2 by standard  poor’s and p2 by moody’s 

 

  

additionally we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of  766 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs including with respect to bank supported letters of credit performance bonds and guarantees approximately  570 million of these credit lines was unutilized and available for use as of yearend 2015 

  

our longterm debt issuance and repayment activity is discussed in the cash flow  financing activities section of this mda  

  

as of december 31 2015 our shortterm borrowing program was rated a2 by standard  poor’s and p2 by moody’s 

as of december 31 2015 standard  poor’s and moody’s rated our longterm credit at bbb positive outlook and baa1 stable outlook respectively a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs  or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing or negotiate new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities should this occur we could seek additional sources of funding including issuing additional term notes or bonds in addition we have the ability at our option to draw upon our 20 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination 

  

we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures 

  

a schedule of our obligations as of december 31 2015 under various notes payable longterm debt agreements operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table  

  



  

 interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at yearend 2015 

  

as of december 31 2015 our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was  85 million we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required therefore these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we are not required to make any contributions to our us pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2016 based on plan asset values as of december 31 2015 we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate  42 million in 2016 these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities distribution centers research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longerterm operating leases vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles 

  

except for the approximately  196 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements see note 13 for information on our operating leases through the normal course of business we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements achieve quicker operational scale expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships  

  

 

market risk 

  

we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control counterparty risk  and ongoing monitoring and reporting  and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than us dollars we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations as of december 31 2015 we had €175 million and €575 million senior notes and a €25 million forward contract designated as net investment hedges 

  

we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to help manage borrowing costs we may enter into interest rate swap agreements under these arrangements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2015 we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of  1675 million 

  

see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity 

  

based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10 adverse change in market rates of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items  

  

global economic and political environment 

  

oil markets and global energy investments 

  

during 2015 a pproximately 28  of our sales were generated from our global energy segment the results of which as noted further below are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets 

  

energy markets 

  

oil prices remained sharply lower in 2015 when compared to 2014 with continued supply pressures negatively impacting exploration and production investments particularly in nort h america additionally we experienced pricing headwinds in 2015 when compared to 2014 demand for oil and overall energy consumption has remained consistent 

  

lower oil prices slowed our 2015 global energy segment results our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market as such we continue to remain confident in the longterm growth prospects of the segment 

  

as petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products lower oil prices will continue to provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs 

  

energy investments 

  

we have a joint venture in kazakhstan which we acquired as part of the champion transaction that holds a contract to supply production chemicals for use in the kashagan oil project a caspian sea shallow water oil field the startup of production at the kashagan project has been significantly delayed and output was indefinitely halted after pipeline failures were discovered in october 2013 we anticipate that the pipelines will be repaired and production restarted however if this does not occur or does not occur in a timely manner we believe the impact of such events would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations our remaining inventory investment is 10 million which is a reduction of approximately 15 million from the third quarter of 2015  the reduction resulted from the sale of inventory during the fourth quarter of 2015  

  

global economies 

  

approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results 

  

global foreign currency markets 

  

during 2015 the us dollar continued to strengthen against most global currencies impacting our comparative results against 2014 we anticipate the trend to continue into 2016 as described in note 8 we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposure s and our investments in foreign operations 

  

 

russia and ukraine 

  

the ongoing political turmoil economic sanctions as well as the depressed oil markets have led to foreign currency pressure as well as higher localized interest rates within russia and ukraine we have experienced no significant impact from these trends and will continue to monitor the economic and political trends within the region net sales within russia and ukraine are approximately 1  of our consolidated net sales assets held in russia and ukraine at november 30 2015 represented less than 1  of our consolidated assets 

  

venezuela 

  

venezuela is a country experiencing a highly inflationary economy as defined under us gaap as a result the us dollar has been the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries any currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings 

  

the venezuelan government has maintained currency controls since 2003 and has directed a series of formal currency devaluations the last of which established the venezuelan currency at 63 bolivares to 1 us dollar during the last two years the venezuelan government has taken the following actions 

  









  

the exchange mechanisms discussed above have become increasingly illiquid and we believe that significant uncertainty continues to exist regarding the exchange mechanisms in venezuela 

  

as of the end of 2015 the increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars through off icial currency exchange markets have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this has significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our venezuelan businesses including restrictions on the ability of our venezuelan businesses to settle us dollardenominated obligat ions the currency controls coupled with importation restrictions workforce regulations pricing constraints and local capitalization requirements have significantly influenced our ability to make and execute operational decisions regarding our businesses in venezuela th e inability of our venezuelan businesses to pay dividends which remain subject to venezuelan government approvals has continued to restrict   our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our venezue lan businesses we expect the conditions described above will continue for the foreseeable future further during the fourth quarter of 2015 given our high level of intercompany receivables we pursued cash basis transactions to limit additional investment 

  

as a result of these factors we concluded that effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not meet the us gaap accounting criteria for control over our venezuelan subsidiaries therefore we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016  this action resulted in a charge of  1234 million  809 million after tax or 0 27 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values resulting in a full impairment the fourth quarter 2015 charge included 85 million of intercompany receivables as well as net assets of our venezuelan businesses and accumulated foreign currency 

  

beginning in 2016 we will exclude the operating results of our venezuelan subsidiaries from our consolidated financial statements and record revenue related to the sale of inventory to our venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent that cash is received for those sales any dividends received from our venezuelan subsidiaries will be recorded as income upon receipt of cash 

  

the decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan subsidiaries was preceded by the remeasurement of our venezuelan water and paper net assets   during the second quarter of 2015 at the simadi exchange rate and the remeasurement of our venezuelan food  beverage and institutional net assets and bolivar portion of our venezuelan energy net assets at the simadi exchange rate during the third quarter of 2015  the combination of these actions resulted in charges of 1 659 million 1 659 million after tax through the first three quarters of 2015 as a result of the ownership structure of our food  beverage and institutional operations in venezuela we reflected 111 million of the above charges as a component of net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income  resulting in a net charge of 1548 million  

  

the total charges during 2015 related to our actions in venezuela were  2782 million  2357 million after tax 2357 million net of the impact from noncontrolling interest or 078 per diluted share  

  

during 2015 venezuela n net sales represented approximately 2  of our consolidated net sales and venezuelan operating income represented approximately 4 of our consolidated operating income  

  

 

new accounting pronouncements 

  

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 

  

subsequent events 

  

during   january 2016 we issued 8 00 million of debt securities consisting of a three year 200  fixed rate noted for a par amount of  4 00 million and a seven year 3 25 fixed rate note for a par amount of  4 00 million the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper  repay the remaining term loan balance   of 125 million and for general corporate purposes 

  

also during january 2016 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted our  400 million 200  debt mentioned above from a fixed rate to a floating rate interest rate the interest rate swap was designated as a fair value hedge  

  

also during january 2016 we purchased certain assets of keedak limited an oilfield chemical distributor in nigeria preacquisition sales of the acquired business are approximately 15 million 

  

during february 2016 we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase 300 million of our common stock 

  

non gaap financial   measures 

  

this mda includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with us gaap these nongaap measures include 

  

   fixed currency sales 

   acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales 

   adjusted cost of sales 

   adjusted gross margin 

   fixed currency operating income 

   adjusted operating income 

   adjusted operating income margin 

   adjusted fixed currency operating income 

   adjusted fixed currency operating income margin 

   ebitda 

   adjusted ebitda 

   adjusted net interest expense 

   adjusted tax rate 

   adjusted net income 

   adjusted diluted earnings per share 

  

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results 

  

we include in special gains and charges items that are unusual in nature and significant in amount in order to better allow investors to compare underlying business performance periodtoperiod we provide adjusted cost of sales adjusted gross margin adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted fixed currency operating income adjusted fixed currency operating income margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net interest expense adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which exclude special gains and charges and discrete tax items the exclusion of special gains and charges and discrete tax items in such adjusted amounts help provide a better understanding of underlying business performance 

  

ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including noncontrolling interest provision for income taxes net interest expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as the sum of ebitda and special gains and charges impacting operating income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used as inputs to our net debt to ebitda and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratios which we view as important indicators of our creditworthiness 

  

the adjusted tax rate measure promotes periodtoperiod comparability of the underlying effective tax rate because it excludes the tax rate impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items which do not necessarily reflect costs associated with historical trends or expected future results 

  

 

we evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange fixed currency sales acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales fixed currency operating income and adjusted fixed currency operating income measures eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our sales acquisition adjusted sales operating income adjusted operating income and acquisition adjusted operating income respectively and promote a better understanding of our underlying sales and operating income trends fixed currency amounts are based on translation into us dollars at fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2015   fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established 

  

acquisition adjusted growth rates generally exclude the results of any acquired business from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture presentation of 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates continue to be handled in such a way in addition 2015 versus 2014 acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude our venezuelan results of operations from both 2015 and 2014 

  

for presentation of 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates due to the rapid pace at which the champion business has been integrated within our global energy segment including all customer selling activity discrete financial data specific to the legacy champion business is no longer available for postacquisition periods as such to allow for a more meaningful 2014 versus 2013 comparison specific to the champion transaction champion’s results for the period prior to acquisition in 2013 have been included for purposes of providing acquisition adjusted growth rates all other acquisitions and divestitures continue to be handled consistent with the mechanics described in the 2015 versus 2014 discussion above the 2014 versus 2013 acquisition adjusted growth rates do not exclude the venezuelan results of operations from either 2014 or 2013 

  

these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to us gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the us gaap measures included in this mda and we have provided reconciliations of reported us gaap amounts to the nongaap amounts

international operations  we directly operate in approximately 90 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

  

  

  

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competition  in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring services and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional and other segments have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our business in our global energy segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product and service quality technical expertise chemical formulations and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the four reportable segments above 

  

number of employees  we had approximately 47000 employees as of december 31 2014 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or 

  

  

distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2014 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit 

  

we sold one class of products within the global institutional segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in any of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 10 and 11 of consolidated net sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents related to our trasar and 3d trasar technology which are material to our water and paper segments and trademarks related to ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar the ecolab trademarks are material to the global industrial global institutional and other segments and the nalco trademarks are material to the water paper and energy businesses the 3d trasar trademarks predominantly relate to our water and paper segments us and foreign patents protect aspects of our key trasar and 3d trasar technology until at least 2024 the ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely 

  

seasonality  we experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 18 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 63 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising and customer equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 24 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and thirdparty logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 24 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids biocides phosphonates phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including acids alcohols amines fatty acids surfactants solvents monomers and polymers healthcare purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination business are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems we purchase more than 9000 raw materials with the largest single raw material representing less than 2 of raw material purchases our raw materials with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are generally purchased on an 

  

  

annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings 

  

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

  

note 14 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 54 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

joint ventures  over time certain of our business units have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements to achieve quicker operational scale to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers in particular our energy and water businesses are parties to numerous joint ventures though many of our other business units also conduct some business through joint ventures during 2014 the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures in the aggregate was less than two percent the table below identifies our most significant consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture 

  

   

   

   

  

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states including california and new york are considering further regulations in this area the california safer consumer products act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe” program dfe has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfe label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees our institutional cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are again being discussed in the us congress and also has garnered considerable 

  

  

discussion with the business and nongovernmental communities the us environmental protection agency “epa” also is more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018 to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 46 million in 2014 and 42 million in 2013 

  

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our pest elimination business applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter “otc” antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg adverse event reporting mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s current good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ee and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

  

other environmental legislation capital expenditures  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water the products we produce and distribute into europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste weee directive 201319eu and restrictive substances rohs directive 201165eu similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 53 million in 2014 and 15 million in 2013 with the increase in 2014 over 2013 due to annualization of capital spend related to acquisitions and focus on safety in worldwide companyowned plants and warehouses approximately 63 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2015 the increase in 2015 over 2014 is due to continued spending on process safety matters throughout the company including facilities acquired in connection with the champion transaction 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy we support a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint to help manage risks related to ghg emissions and identify costeffective reduction opportunities ecolab joined epa’s climate leaders program in 2005 though epa announced in 2010 that it was dissolving the program ecolab has continued with much of its work to reduce its carbon footprint in 2014 we received a climate leadership award cosponsored by epa recognizing ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 125 percent 224 percent intensity reduction 

  

our current global sustainability targets were established in 2014 they include a 25 percent reduction in effluent discharge and waste a 20 percent reduction in water use and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2017 in addition to our internal sustainability performance we partner with customers at more than 13 million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services these actions directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the demand for energy 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 25 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at nine sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated 

  

  

with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 50 million in 2014 and 42 million in 2013 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2014 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 25 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled forwardlooking statements located on page 1 of this form 10k 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  the oil and gas drilling completion and stimulation oil and gas production and refinery and petrochemical plant markets served by our global energy segment may be impacted by substantial fluctuations in oil and gas prices moreover economic downturns and in particular downturns in the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers in recent years the weaker global economic environment particularly in europe and emerging markets such as china and brazil has negatively impacted many of our endmarkets weaker economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such cycles these endusers may reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors  economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk for example we do business in venezuela which experienced a currency devaluation in 2010 and again in 2013 and as discussed at pages 28 and 29 of the management’s discussion  analysis section of the annual report incorporated by reference with respect to item 7 of part ii of this form 10k we may experience the recognition of a currency devaluation loss in future periods in the event we utilize current or future foreign exchange mechanisms established by the venezuelan government similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue the integration of new businesses which may 

  

  

be led by personnel that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  in addition to the energy restructuring plan and combined restructuring plan discussed under note 3 entitled “special gains and charges” located on pages 41 to 42 of the annual report and incorporated by reference with respect to item 8 of part ii of this form 10k we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we continue to invest in our erp systems to integrate and streamline our processes and to improve our competitiveness these initiatives involve complex business process design and a breakdown in certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack recent acquisitions including the nalco and champion transactions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in the system’s infrastructure likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2014 approximately 49 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  

·   exchange controls and currency restrictions 

  

·   currency fluctuations and devaluations 

  

·   tariffs and trade barriers 

  

·   export duties and quotas 

  

·   changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials energy and utilities 

  

·   changes in local economic conditions 

  

·   changes in laws and regulations including the imposition of economic sanctions affecting commercial transactions in countries such as the russian federation 

  

·   difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws 

  

·   difficulties in collecting receivables or realizing other assets including with respect to a joint venture investment in kazakhstan as discussed at page 28 of the management’s discussion  

  

  

analysis section of the annual report incorporated by reference with respect to item 7 of part ii of this form 10k 

  

·   requirements to include local ownership or management in our business 

  

·   economic and business objectives that differ from those of our joint venture partners 

  

·   exposure to possible expropriation nationalization or other government actions 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 

  

·   unsettled political conditions military action civil unrest acts of terrorism force majeure war or other armed conflict and 

  

·   countries whose governments have been hostile to usbased businesses 

  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

  

we are a defendant in six wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the fair labor standards act “flsa” or a similar state law while we have settled one other wage hour case during the past year — namely cooper v ecolab inc california state court  superior court  los angeles county case no bc486875 a case in which the plaintiffs sought certification of a purported class of terminated california employees of any business for alleged violation of statutory obligations regarding payment of accrued vacation upon termination — there can be no assurance that other pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” were named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

all but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” the remaining case was franks v sea tow of south miss inc et al cause no a240210228 circuit court of harrison county mississippi the franks case was dismissed in may 2014 

  

nalco company  the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims against nalco because claims remain pending against other defendants the court’s decision is not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the court’s decision we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won these suits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and 

  

  

local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

we have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility as of december 31 2014 we had net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents of approximately 64 billion our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects 

  

·   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities 

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service obligations and other general operating requirements 

  

·   placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 

  

·   limiting flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations and 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

  

in addition approximately 18 billion of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately 185 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2014 we had goodwill of 67 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and champion transactions which resulted in the addition of 45 billion and 10 billion of goodwill respectively if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely   we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax 

  

  

asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

other 

  

this reportable segment consists of the global pest elimination and equipment care operating units it provides pest elimination and kitchen repair and maintenance with its two operating units that are primarily feeforservice businesses in general these businesses provide service which can augment or extend our product offerings to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

  

  

and in particular by enhancing our food safety capabilities 

  

global pest elimination  global pest elimination provides services designed to detect eliminate and prevent pests such as rodents and insects in restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quick service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers the services of global pest elimination are sold and performed by companyemployed field sales and service personnel 

  

our global pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage in addition to the united states which constitutes the largest operation we operate this business in various countries in asia pacific western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france the united kingdom and brazil 

  

we believe global pest elimination is one of the leading suppliers of pest elimination programs to the commercial hospitality and institutional markets in the geographies we serve 

  

equipment care  our equipment care business provides equipment repair maintenance and preventive maintenance services for the commercial food service industry repair services are offered for inwarranty repair acting as the manufacturer’s authorized service agent as well as afterwarranty repair in addition equipment care operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and enduse customers at this time the equipment care business operates solely in the united states 

  

we believe that our equipment care business is a leading provider of equipment maintenance and repair programs to the commercial food service industry in the united states locations in which we compete 

  

additional information 

  

international operations  we directly operate in approximately 90 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in some cases through a joint venture with a local partner in certain countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues in general our businesses conducted outside the united states are similar to those conducted in the united states 

  

  

our business operations outside the united states are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our 

  

  

businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size and iv the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

competition  in general the markets in which the businesses in our global industrial segment compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services our businesses in these segments compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring services and dosing and metering equipment 

  

the businesses in our global institutional and other segments have two significant classes of competitors first we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation 

  

our business in our global energy segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas we compete in this business on the basis of our product and service quality technical expertise chemical formulations and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the four reportable segments above 

  

number of employees  we had approximately 45415 employees as of december 31 2013 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2013 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit 

  

we sold two classes of products within the global institutional segment which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in any of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 10 of 2013 consolidated net sales approximately 11 in 2012 and approximately 18 in 2011 in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses around the world we sell laundry products to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products were approximately 10 of consolidated net sales in 2011 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents 

  

  

related to our trasar and 3d trasar technology which are material to our global water and global paper segments and trademarks related to ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar the ecolab trademarks are material to the global industrial global institutional and other segments and the nalco trademarks are material to the global water global paper and global energy businesses the 3d trasar trademarks predominantly relate to our global water and global paper segments us and foreign patents protect aspects of our key trasar and 3d trasar technology until at least 2024 the ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely 

  

seasonality  we experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 18 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 65 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising and customer equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 26 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and thirdparty logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 26 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids biocides phosphonates phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including acids amines fatty acids surfactants solvents monomers and polymers global healthcare purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems we purchase more than 8000 raw materials with the largest single raw material representing less than 3 of raw material purchases our raw materials with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings 

  

  

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

  

note 14 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 56 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

joint ventures  over time certain of our business units have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements to more quickly achieve operational scale to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers in particular our global energy and global water businesses are parties to numerous joint ventures though many of our other business units also conduct some business through joint ventures during 2013 the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures in the aggregate was less than one percent the table below identifies our most significant consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture 

  

local ownership requirements  geographic expansion 

  

   

operational scale  geographic critical mass 

  

   

technology  expanded product offering  manufacturing capability 

  

   

we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including 

  

  

product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 for example label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine maryland massachusetts minnesota oregon and south carolina environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in 2012 were considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states including california and new york are considering further regulations in this area the california safer consumer products act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure the us government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives including its “design for the environment” “dfe” program dfe has three broad areas of work recognition of safer products on a dfe label development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals and we are involved in these to varying degrees ecolab’s institutional cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date ecolab generally has been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are again being discussed in the us congress and also has garnered considerable discussion with the business and nongovernmental communities the us environmental protection agency “epa” also is more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018 to help manage this program we have been simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces in process fluids and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 42 million in 2013 and 37 million in 2012 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage 

  

  

these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our global pest elimination business applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations for overthecounter “otc” antiseptic drug products which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ecc as amended by 200747ec and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

  

other environmental legislation capital expenditures  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 15 million in 2013 and 20 million in 2012 approximately 50 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2014 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab is committed to reducing its carbon footprint to help manage risks from ghg emissions and identify costeffective reduction opportunities ecolab joined epa’s climate leaders program in 2005 though epa announced in 2010 that it was dissolving the program ecolab has continued with much of its work to reduce its carbon footprint for example ecolab has developed a usbased ghg inventory of the six major greenhouse gases and reported progress against ecolab’s goal of reducing ghg emissions by 19 per dollar sales from 2006 to 2012 using the combined company’s 2012 metrics as an operational baseline ecolab set new goals in 2013 to further improve its environmental impact within the next five years among these new targets ecolab will work to achieve a five percent reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions a 10 percent reduction in water use and wastewater discharge and a 10 percent reduction in the disposal of solid waste per million dollars in sales we also leverage over one million customer locations globally to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services these actions directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the demand for energy we can indirectly reduce energy demand by recognizing the critical connection of water and energy especially in industrial processes reliant on water to transmit thermal energy our customers employ our technologies and expertise in an exponentially greater scale to improve their own overall energy use 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 42 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 42 million in 2013 and 24 million in 2012 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2013 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 22 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

disclosure of certain activities related to iran  we had no transactions in 2013 in iran or any other country subject to comprehensive us economic sanctions including the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 the “iran threat reduction act” or which would otherwise require disclosure under the iran threat reduction act

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  economic downturns and in particular downturns in the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers in recent years the weak global economic environment particularly in the united states and europe has negatively impacted many of our endmarkets weak economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such cycles these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar other regions of the world including emerging market areas also expose us to foreign currency risk for example we do business in venezuela which experienced a currency devaluation in 2010 and again in 2013 similar currency devaluations credit market disruptions or other economic turmoil in other countries could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the local currency versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations which are generated in the local currency and then translated to us dollars 

  

we may encounter difficulties completing the integration of the nalco and champion transactions and fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions   on december 1 2011 we completed the nalco merger and on april 10 2013 we completed the acquisition of champion following the acquisition of champion ecolab commenced a restructuring plan to integrate the nalco global energy business with champion to realize acquisitionrelated cost synergies as well as strengthen and streamline the company’s position in the fast growing global energy market additionally during 2013 ecolab combined a nalco merger restructuring plan commenced in january 2012 with a separate legacy ecolab restructuring plan commenced in february 2011 the combined plan focuses on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities including reductions of plant and distribution center locations potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration activities and restructuring plans which may preclude us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of the nalco and champion transactions including expected synergies include the following 

  

  

·   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses including the challenge of integrating complex information technology systems communications systems financial reporting systems supply chain and procurement arrangements and other assets of nalco and champion in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies 

  

·   the possibility that our businesses may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the impact of the integration on employees and customers 

  

·   potential unknown liabilities in the legacy nalco and champion businesses or arising out of integration of the businesses 

  

·   unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration of the various businesses 

  

·   the inability to successfully combine the businesses of the companies in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from these transactions 

  

·   problems that may arise in integrating the workforces of the companies including the possible loss of key employees 

  

·   potential problems in maintaining and integrating effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company and 

  

·   the disruption of or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions or could reduce the combined company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue to integrate nalco and champion which are led by industry veterans that we believe are critical to the success of the integration and the prospects of the business our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  in addition to the restructuring plans related to the nalco and champion transactions we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular we continue to invest in our erp systems to integrate and streamline our processes and to improve our competitiveness these initiatives involve complex business process design and a breakdown in certain of these processes could result in business disruption if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack recent acquisitions including the 

  

  

nalco and champion transactions have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in the system’s infrastructure likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2013 approximately 49 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  

·   exchange controls and currency restrictions 

  

·   currency fluctuations and devaluations 

  

·   tariffs and trade barriers 

  

·   export duties and quotas 

  

·   changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials energy and utilities 

  

·   changes in local economic conditions 

  

·   changes in laws and regulations 

  

·   difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws 

  

·   difficulties in collecting receivables or realizing other assets 

  

·   requirements to include local ownership or management in our business 

  

·   exposure to possible expropriation nationalization or other government actions 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 

  

·   unsettled political conditions military action civil unrest acts of terrorism force majeure war or other armed conflict and 

  

·   countries whose governments have been hostile to usbased businesses 

  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such 

  

  

policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we are a defendant in five wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the fair labor standards act “flsa” or a similar state law while we have settled two other wage hour cases during the past year including doug ladore v ecolab inc et al united states district court for the central district of california case no cv 119386 gaf fmox which was a putative wage hour class action brought on behalf of california pest elimination employees there can be no assurance that other pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” was named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

  

all but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” the remaining case is franks v sea tow of south miss inc et al cause no a240210228 circuit court of harrison county mississippi the “remaining case” 

  

nalco company  the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims against nalco because claims remain pending against other defendants the court’s decision is not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the court’s decision nalco will request that the remaining case be similarly dismissed for the reasons accepted in the mdl we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won or if the remaining state court case is not dismissed these suits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

we have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility as of december 31 2013 we had net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents of 66 billion our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects 

  

  

·   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities 

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service obligations and other general operating requirements 

  

·   placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 

  

·   limiting flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations and 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

  

in addition approximately 116 billion of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately 116 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions and other acquisitions ecolab expects to 

  

  

continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs as of december 31 2013 we had goodwill of 69 billion which is maintained in various reporting units including goodwill from the nalco and champion transactions which resulted in the addition of 45 billion and 10 billion of goodwill respectively if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco and champion transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely   we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

a chemical spill or release could adversely impact our business  as a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled released or discharged either in liquid or gaseous form during production transportation or use such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard accordingly such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

item 1a general development of business  

  

ecolab was incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1924 our fiscal year is the calendar year ending december 31 

  

in 2012 we took the following actions to continue to build our business 

  

·   throughout the year we made significant progress in integrating nalco holding company “nalco” which we acquired by means of a merger in december 2011 

  

·   in january 2012 we announced that we are undertaking a restructuring and other costsaving actions in connection with the integration of the nalco business which includes a reduction of our global workforce and the streamlining of our supply chain footprint we expect total charges relating to these actions to be approximately 180 million and this restructuring plan to be substantially completed by the end of 2013 

  

·   also in january we redeemed 17 billion of nalco outstanding senior notes

international cleaning sanitizing  other services segment 

  

our international cleaning sanitizing  other services segment directly operates in approximately 75 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of venezuela through a joint venture with a local partner in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international cleaning sanitizing  other services operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general our international cleaning sanitizing  other services businesses are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all of our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business healthcare and textile care are also meaningful businesses in our international operations particularly in europe kay has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quick service restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage we operate this business in various countries in asia pacific western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france the united kingdom and brazil 

  

our other cleaning and sanitizing businesses are conducted less extensively internationally however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are also operated in canada 

  

our international cleaning sanitizing  other services businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions ii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions and iii the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations

additional information 

  

competition  our businesses in our us cleaning  sanitizing us other services and international cleaning sanitizing  other services segments have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of these business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation we create value by providing stateoftheart cleaning sanitation water treatment and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on ways to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition to our consultative approach we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

  

our businesses in our global water global paper and global energy segments compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations customer support detection equipment monitoring services and dosing and metering equipment in general some of the markets in which these businesses compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions 

  

with respect to global water the market for water treatment chemicals is highly fragmented but is led by ecolab four other companies are present in at least two of the major geographic regions of the globe with one present in all regions these global or regional service providers tend to focus either on a limited geographic region or a smaller subset of products and services the remainder of the market is comprised of local competitors collectively local players have the largest share of the market but are individually much smaller and tend to focus on servicing local businesses typically requiring less sophisticated applications 

  

with respect to our global paper business the market for specialty and water treatment chemicals used in the pulp and paper industry is fragmented we are one of the leading suppliers with four other multinationals having significant presence the remainder of the market is comprised of smaller regional participants 

  

the largest participants in portions of the energy services sector are ecolab’s global energy business and three other multinationals the remainder of the market consists of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the six reportable segments above 

  

number of employees  we had approximately 40860 employees as of december 31 2012 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2012 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit 

  

we sold two classes of products within the u s cleaning  sanitizing and international cleaning sanitizing  other services segments which comprised 10 or more of consolidated net sales in any of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 11 of consolidated 2012 net sales and approximately 18 in 2011 and approximately 19 in 2010 in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses around the world we sell laundry products to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products were approximately 10 of consolidated net sales in 2011 and 2010 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents related to our trasar and 3d trasar technology which are material to our global water and global paper segments and trademarks related to ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar the ecolab trademarks are material to the us cleaning  sanitizing us other services and international cleaning sanitizing  other services segments and the nalco trademarks are material to the global water global paper and global energy 

  

  

segments the 3d trasar trademarks predominantly relate to our global water and global paper segments us and foreign patents protect aspects of our key trasar and 3d trasar technology until at least 2024 the ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely 

  

seasonality  we experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 61 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising and customer equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 27 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and thirdparty logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 27 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids biocides phosphonates phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including acids amines fatty acids surfactants solvents monomers and polymers our healthcare division purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems we purchase more than 8000 raw materials with the largest single raw material representing less than 3 of raw material purchases our raw materials with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings 

  

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

  

note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 50 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

  

joint ventures  over time certain of our businesses have entered into general partnerships or joint ventures for limited scope business opportunities in 2004 we entered into a joint venture with katayama chemical inc for the marketing and sale of our water treatment and process chemicals in japan in 2008 we formed a joint venture with stepan company operating under the tiorco brand to globally market customengineered chemical solutions for increased production of crude oil and gas from existing fields in 2010 we formed new joint ventures in south africa with a subsidiary of protea chemicals and in russia with a subsidiary of lukoil we also have longstanding partnerships in saudi arabia global water and global energy spain global water and venezuela international cleaning sanitizing  other services and we also maintain joint ventures in jurisdictions requiring local participation in our business we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts minnesota and oregon environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in 2012 were considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the us congress in each of the past few years but has not passed and several states including california and new york are considering further regulations in this area the california safer consumer products act regulations are expected to be enacted in 2013 and will focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure ecolab’s institutional cleaning products will be subject to the regulations and can incur additional stayinmarket expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are again being discussed in the us congress the us environmental protection agency epa also is more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we have met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 registration deadline and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2013 to help manage this new program we are simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and numerous countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 37 million in 2012 and 30 million in 2011 

  

  

in europe the biocidal product directive and the more recent biocidal products regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer distributor and marketer of medical devices we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling distribution and marketing of medical devices we also are required to register with the fda as a medical device manufacturer comply with postmarket reporting eg mdr and recall requirements and to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg medical device directive 9342ecc as amended by 200747ec and iso 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

  

other environmental legislation capital expenditures  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 20 million in 2012 and 10 million in 2011 approximately 18 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2013 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly apply to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab is committed to reducing its carbon footprint to help manage risks from ghg emissions and identify costeffective reduction opportunities ecolab joined epa’s climate leaders program in 2005 though epa announced in 2010 that it was dissolving the program ecolab has continued with much of its work to reduce its carbon footprint for example ecolab has developed a usbased ghg inventory of the six major greenhouse gases and reported progress against ecolab’s goal of reducing ghg emissions by 20 per dollar sales from 2006 to 2012 in 2013 ecolab plans to introduce new comprehensive environmental goals we also leverage over one million customers globally to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through highefficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation water paper and energy services these actions directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the demand for energy likewise we can indirectly reduce energy demand by recognizing the critical connection of water and energy especially in industrial processes reliant on water to transmit thermal energy we have made progress on our goals to reduce water consumption disposed waste and effluent water by 18 percent per metric ton of shipped product by 2015 our customers likewise employ our technologies and expertise in an exponentially greater scale to improve their own overall energy demand 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 33 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at four sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributed hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 24 million in 2012 and 1 million in 2011 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2012 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 10 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

disclosure of certain activities related to iran 

  

ecolab has had a longstanding policy and practice of prohibiting all activity in countries subject to comprehensive us economic sanctions including iran the “sanctioned countries” this policy was in place prior to passage of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 pursuant to which all entities owned or controlled by us companies are prohibited from engaging in activities in iran effective december 1 2011 ecolab acquired nalco which at the time of the acquisition had foreign subsidiaries that engaged in sales in iran shortly following the closing of the nalco acquisition ecolab instructed all nalco subsidiaries to cease all activities in the sanctioned countries by march 31 2012 consistent with ecolab’s directive and policy nalco’s sales in iran ceased and all incountry activity was terminated the limited activities in iran described below were made within the context of the process of winding down the business

 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled forwardlooking statements located on page 1 of this form 10k 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  economic downturns and in particular downturns in the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining and steel industries can adversely impact our endusers in recent years the weak global economic environment particularly in the united states and europe has negatively impacted many of our endmarkets the ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and fiscal policy in the united states may further weaken the us and global economy further decline in economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 and 2012 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar the current economic conditions in several european countries particularly italy spain portugal greece and ireland deteriorated during 2012 further weakening of the european economy may cause a drop in the value of the european currencies including the euro one potential extreme outcome of the european financial situation is the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or the dissolution of the euro entirely the potential dissolution of the euro or market perceptions concerning this and related issues could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and obligations further turmoil in the european union’s sovereign debt market or a similar financial crisis could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the euro versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our european operations which are generated in euros and other european currencies and then translated to us dollars 

  

other regions of the world also expose us to foreign currency risk for example we do business in venezuela which experienced a currency devaluation in 2010 and again in 2013 a similar currency devaluation in other countries could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

  

  

we may encounter difficulties completing the nalco integration and fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the merger   on december 1 2011 we completed the nalco merger the merger involves the combination of two companies that historically operated as independent public companies we have devoted and will need to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of nalco potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process which may preclude us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger including expected synergies include the following 

  

·   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses including the challenge of integrating complex information technology systems communications systems financial reporting systems supply chain and procurement arrangements and other assets of nalco in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies 

  

·   the possibility that our businesses may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the impact of the integration on employees and customers 

  

·   potential unknown liabilities in the legacy nalco business or arising out of the integration 

  

·   unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration 

  

·   the inability to successfully combine the businesses of ecolab and nalco in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from the merger 

  

·   problems that may arise in integrating the workforces of the two companies including the possible loss of key employees 

  

·   potential problems in maintaining and integrating effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company and 

  

·   the disruption of or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce the combined company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

  

the pending acquisition of champion may present certain risks to the business and operations of ecolab and to the combined company following the acquisition on october 11 2012 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” among ecolab ofc technologies corp a texas corporation and a whollyowned subsidiary of ecolab and permian mud service inc a texas corporation “permian” permian is the parent company of champion technologies inc and corsicana technologies inc together with permian “champion” pursuant to the merger agreement which has been approved by the boards of directors of each of ecolab and permian and the shareholders of permian we will acquire champion by way of a merger subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement at the closing of the acquisition the shares of common stock of permian issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time other than shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn will be converted into the right to receive merger consideration of approximately 216 billion subject to customary adjustments for cash debt and working capital and certain additional adjustments as set out in the merger agreement subject to certain adjustments the merger consideration will be paid 

  

  

approximately 75 in cash and 25 in shares of ecolab common stock additionally we will be required to pay to the permian stockholders an additional amount in cash up to 100 million in the aggregate equal to 50 of the incremental federal tax on the merger consideration as a result of increases in applicable capital gains and investment taxes after december 31 2012 

  

the consummation of the champion acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various closing conditions including among others the receipt of required regulatory approvals including approval of the transaction under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended “hsr act” 

  

the closing of the pending champion acquisition is subject to a number of risks including among other things risks that 

  

·   the regulatory approvals or clearances required for the acquisition including clearance under the hsr act may not be obtained or required regulatory approvals may delay the transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on the company or cause the company to abandon the transaction in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition 

  

·   the other conditions to the closing of the acquisition may not be satisfied resulting in the company abandoning the transaction in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition 

  

·   a material adverse change event or occurrence may affect the company or champion prior to the closing of the transaction and may delay the acquisition or cause the company to abandon the transaction in which case it will not realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition 

  

in addition if the acquisition is completed the anticipated success of the acquisition is subject to a number of risks including among other things risks that 

  

·   problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the company and champion particularly in light of the continuing integration efforts and challenges resulting from the nalco merger which may result in the combined business not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected 

  

·   the acquisition may involve unexpected costs unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays 

  

·   the credit ratings of the company may be different from what the company currently expects 

  

·   the businesses of the company or champion may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the acquisition and 

  

·   disruptions from the transaction could harm relationships with customers employees and suppliers 

  

other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on future results performance or achievements of the company and the combined business 

  

we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of champion including professional fees and other fees costs and expenses if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances we may be required to pay champion a termination fee of 100 million we also expect to incur significant integration and restructuring fees and costs following completion of the acquisition 

  

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities this is especially crucial as we continue to integrate nalco and potentially integrate champion as important resources are shifted to planning and executing key integration initiatives as well as cost and growth synergies during this stage in the integration experienced business and financial leaders and experts are critical to the success of these and other acquisitions our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  in addition to the nalco merger and the potential champion acquisition we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular in 2011 we announced various initiatives to capture financial and operational benefits in our european business in part by leveraging our erp system and to improve our competitiveness in the region those initiatives remain in progress and integration activities could impact our ability to timely execute these initiatives if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security we rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack recent acquisitions including the nalco merger have resulted in further decentralization of systems and additional complexity in the system’s infrastructure likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 170 countries and in 2012 approximately 50 of our net sales originated outside the united states there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  

·   exchange controls and currency restrictions 

  

·   currency fluctuations and devaluations 

  

·   tariffs and trade barriers 

  

·   export duties and quotas 

  

·   changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials energy and utilities 

  

·   changes in local economic conditions 

  

·   changes in laws and regulations 

  

·   difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws 

  

·   difficulties in collecting receivables or realizing other assets 

  

  

·   requirements to include local ownership or management in our business 

  

·   exposure to possible expropriation nationalization or other government actions 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 

  

·   unsettled political conditions military action civil unrest acts of terrorism force majeure war or other armed conflict and 

  

·   countries whose governments have been hostile to usbased businesses 

  

also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act as well as us economic sanctions regulations we have internal policies and procedures relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures violations of such laws and regulations could result in investigations of the company and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we are a defendant in seven wage hour lawsuits claiming violations of the fair labor standards act “flsa” or a similar state law one of the cases doug ladore v ecolab inc et al united states district court for the central district of california case no cv 119386 gaf fmox is a putative wage hour class action brought on behalf of california pest elimination employees the case has been certified for class treatment and on january 22 2013 the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was granted and the court found that the class of employees was entitled to overtime pay on february 22 2013 we reached a preliminary settlement with the plaintiffs which remains subject to court approval 

  

  

there can be no assurance that other pending or future wage hour lawsuits can be successfully defended or settled 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs our subsidiaries were named as defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government 

  

nalco company and certain affiliates collectively “nalco” was named as a defendant in a series of class action and individual plaintiff lawsuits arising from this event the plaintiffs in these matters claimed damages under products liability tort and other theories nalco was also named as a third party defendant in certain matters nalco was indemnified in these matters by another of the defendants 

  

all but one of these cases have been administratively transferred to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” the remaining case is franks v sea tow of south miss inc et al cause no a240210228 circuit court of harrison county mississippi the “remaining case” 

  

nalco company  the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

on november 28 2012 the federal court in the mdl entered an order dismissing all claims against nalco because claims remain pending against other defendants the court’s decision is not a “final judgment” for purposes of appeal plaintiffs will have 30 days after entry of final judgment to appeal the court’s decision nalco will request that the remaining case be similarly dismissed for the reasons accepted in the mdl we cannot predict whether there will be an appeal of the dismissal the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation however if an appeal by plaintiffs in these lawsuits is brought and won or if the remaining state court case is not dismissed these suits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated result of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

we have substantial indebtedness which will impact our financial flexibility as of december 31 2012 we had net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents of 54 billion our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects 

  

·   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities 

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service obligations and other general operating requirements 

  

·   placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 

  

·   limiting flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations and 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

  

in addition approximately 750 million of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately 75 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses 

  

  

deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the nalco merger and other acquisitions   the nalco merger is treated as an acquisition of nalco by ecolab for accounting purposes both ecolab and nalco have in the past expanded their operations through other acquisitions and joint ventures involving businesses owned by third parties ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions including the pending champion acquisition and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill as of december 31 2012 we had goodwill of 59 billion which is maintained in various reporting units if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco merger or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely   we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more 

  

  

likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the energy foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper mining steel and other industries cause a downturn in the business of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

in general our international businesses are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all of our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business healthcare and textile care are also meaningful businesses in our international operations particularly in europe kay has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quick service restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage we operate this business in various countries in asia pacific western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france and the united kingdom 

  

our other legacy ecolab businesses are conducted less extensively internationally however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are also operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws international business laws and regulations tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the smaller scale of international operations where many operating locations are smaller in size ii the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions and iii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions proportionately larger investments in sales technical support and administrative personnel are also necessary in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations

additional information 

  

competition  our legacy ecolab business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of these business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduse customer segments our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation we create value by providing stateoftheart cleaning sanitation water treatment and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on ways to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition to our consultative approach we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

legacy nalco’s water management and process improvement service business units compete on the basis of their demonstrated value technical expertise chemical formulations consulting services detection equipment monitoring services and dosing and metering equipment in general the markets in which the business units compete are led by a few large companies with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions the market for water treatment chemicals is highly fragmented but is led by nalco four other companies are present in at least two of the major geographic regions of the globe with one present in all regions these global or regional service providers tend to focus either on a limited geographic region or a smaller subset of products and services the remainder of the market is comprised of local competitors collectively local players have the largest share of the market but are individually much smaller and tend to focus on servicing local businesses typically requiring less sophisticated applications 

  

the market for specialty and water treatment chemicals used in the pulp and paper industry is fragmented we are one of the leading suppliers with four other multinationals having significant presence the remainder of the market is comprised of smaller regional participants 

  

the largest participants in the energy services sector are nalco and three other multinationals the remainder of the market consists of smaller regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation water treatment and process chemistry needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the six reportable segments above 

  

number of employees  we had approximately 40200 employees as of december 31 2011 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2011 consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which constituted 10 percent or more of consolidated sales in any of the last three years sales of warewashing products were approximately 18 of consolidated 2011 sales and approximately 19 in both 2010 and 2009 in addition through our 

  

  

institutional and textile care businesses around the world we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products were approximately 10 of consolidated net sales in 2011 and 2010 and 11 in 2009 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents related to our trasar and 3d trasar technology which are material to our water services and paper services segments and trademarks related to ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar the ecolab trademarks are material to the legacy ecolab segments and the nalco trademarks are material to the legacy nalco segments the 3d trasar trademarks predominantly relate to our water services and paper services segments us and foreign patents protect aspects of our key trasar and 3d trasar technology until at least 2024 the ecolab nalco company and 3d trasar trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely 

  

seasonality  we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 51 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising and customer equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 24 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and thirdparty logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 24 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids biocides phosphonates phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including acids amines fatty acids surfactants solvents monomers and polymers our healthcare division purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems we purchase more than 8000 raw materials with the largest single raw material representing less than 3 of raw material purchases our raw materials with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings 

  

  

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers

joint ventures  over time our nalco businesses have entered into general partnerships or joint ventures for limited scope business opportunities in 2004 nalco entered into a joint venture with katayama chemical inc or kci for the marketing and sale of our water treatment and process chemicals in japan kci is a leading participant in these markets in japan and the venture permits the combination of our broad product portfolio with kci’s strong market presence this joint venture does not include manufacturing research and administrative resources which are provided to the joint venture by the parents in 2008 we formed a joint venture with stepan company operating under the tiorco brand to globally market customengineered chemical solutions for increased production of crude oil and gas from existing fields the joint venture is equally owned and controlled by nalco and stepan the two partners will capture most of the value generation directly nalco has a joint venture with siemens water technologies inc treated water outsourcing to pursue process water treatment outsourcing projects and to supply standard water treatment equipment packages with our chemicals and service offerings additionally we maintain longstanding partnerships in saudi arabia and in spain in 2010 nalco formed new joint ventures in south africa with a subsidiary of protea chemicals and in russia with a subsidiary of lukoil we also maintain joint ventures in jurisdictions requiring local participation in our business we will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic technological and product reach 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations similarly the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations changes in such laws and regulations including among others air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production including those related to hydraulic fracturing could impact the sales of some of our products or services in addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products 

  

additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts minnesota and oregon environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in 2011 were considered by several other state legislatures cleaning 

  

  

product ingredient disclosure legislation was reintroduced in the us congress in 2011 but did not pass and several states including california and new york are considering further regulations in this area to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are being discussed in the us congress the us environmental protection agency epa is also more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern we anticipate that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe we have met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 registration deadline and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2013 and beyond to help manage this new program we are simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements the impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and a few countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation the impact of ghs will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain several hundred product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide 

  

  

registrations and for the california tax were approximately 3 million in 2011 and 2010 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive “bpd” established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the bpd and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear bpd phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and foods in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing manufacturing packaging labeling and marketing of medical devices we also are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg iso standard 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical devices and drug products no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal 

  

  

requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 10 million in 2011 and 6 million in 2010 approximately 16 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2012 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly applies to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab is committed to reducing its carbon footprint to help manage risks from ghg emissions and identify costeffective reduction opportunities ecolab joined us epa’s climate leaders program in 2005 though epa announced in 2010 that it was dissolving the program ecolab has continued with much of its work to reduce its carbon footprint for example ecolab has developed a ghg inventory of the six major greenhouse gases and reported progress against ecolab’s goal of reducing ghg emissions by 20 per dollar sales from 2006 to 2012 we are currently evaluating what impact the recent nalco merger will have on our ability to achieve this goal 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prp” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 27 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at five sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures in each of these chemical exposure cases our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf with or without reservation and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible however we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance 

  

we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances including multiparty lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services while we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse 

  

  

effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 1 million in both 2011 and 2010 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2011 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 5 million we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

we may be unable to integrate nalco successfully and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger   on december 1 2011 we completed the nalco merger the merger involves the combination of two companies that historically operated as independent public companies we will need to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of nalco potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process which may preclude us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger including expected synergies include the following 

  

·   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses including the challenge of integrating complex information technology systems communications systems financial reporting systems supply chain and procurement arrangements and other assets of nalco in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies 

  

  

·   the possibility that our businesses may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the impact of the integration on employees and customers 

  

·   potential unknown liabilities in the legacy nalco business or arising out of the integration 

  

·   unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration 

  

·   the inability to successfully combine the businesses of ecolab and nalco in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from the merger 

  

·   problems that may arise in integrating the workforces of the two companies including the possible loss of key employees 

  

·   potential problems in maintaining and integrating effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company 

  

·   the lack of depth of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities such as possible acquisition opportunities and 

  

·   the disruption of or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or could reduce the combined company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 

  

in addition with approximately 47 billion in sales in 2011 and approximately 13700 employees the merger of nalco’s business with ecolab has increased the size of our business significantly our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements and other benefits anticipated from the merger 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees this is even more crucial following the nalco merger as important resources are shifted to planning and executing key integration initiatives as well as cost and growth synergies during this stage in the integration experienced business and financial leaders and experts are critical to the success of the merger our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us 

  

our results can be adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  in addition to the nalco merger we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular in february 2011 we announced various initiatives to capture financial and operational benefits in our european business in part by leveraging our new erp system and 

  

  

to improve our competitiveness in the region those initiatives remain in progress and the nalco integration activities could impact our ability to timely execute these initiatives if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care food processing pulp and paper and energy industries can adversely impact our endusers in recent years the weak global economic environment particularly in the united states and europe have negatively impacted many of our endmarkets further decline in economic activity may continue to adversely affect these markets during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets in 2011 the european union’s sovereign debt crisis negatively impacted economic activity in that region as well as the strength of the euro versus the us dollar further turmoil in the european union’s sovereign debt market or a similar financial crisis could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity including in our key endmarkets and by further weakening the euro versus the us dollar resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our european operations which are generated in euros and other european currencies and then translated to us dollars 

  

our significant nonus operations expose us to global economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability we have significant operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances we conduct business in approximately 160 countries and in 2011 approximately 49 of our net sales originated outside the united states some of our business is conducted in politically unstable countries there are inherent risks in our international operations including 

  

·   exchange controls and currency restrictions 

  

·   currency fluctuations and devaluations 

  

·   tariffs and trade barriers 

  

·   export duties and quotas 

  

·   changes in local economic conditions 

  

·   changes in laws and regulations 

  

·   difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with foreign laws 

  

·   exposure to possible expropriation nationalization or other government actions 

  

·   restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 

  

·   unsettled political conditions military action civil unrest acts of terrorism force majeure war or other armed conflict and 

  

·   countries whose governments have been hostile to usbased businesses 

  

our international operations also expose us to different local political and business risks and challenges for example in certain countries we are faced with periodic political issues that could result in difficulties in collecting receivables or realizing other assets currency risks or the risk that we are required to include local 

  

  

ownership or management in our businesses also because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments we are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty which has impacted our business in some countries other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations including our obligations to design local solutions to manage credit risk to local customers and distributors 

  

further our operations outside the united states require us to comply with a number of united states and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act we have internal policies relating to such regulations however there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the reckless acts of employees or representatives and violations of such laws could result in investigations of the company and sanctions 

  

our overall success as a global business depends in part upon our ability to succeed in differing economic social legal and political conditions we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs our subsidiaries are defendants in pending lawsuits alleging negligence and injury resulting from the use of our corexit dispersant in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill which could expose us to monetary damages or settlement costs on april 22 2010 the deepwater drilling platform the deepwater horizon operated by a subsidiary of bp plc sank in the gulf of mexico after a catastrophic explosion and fire that began on april 20 2010 a massive oil spill resulted approximately one week following the incident subsidiaries of bp plc under the authorization of the responding federal agencies formally requested our indirect subsidiary nalco company to supply large quantities of corexit 9500 a nalco oil dispersant product listed on the us epa national contingency plan product schedule nalco company responded immediately by providing available corexit and increasing production to supply the product to bp’s subsidiaries for use as authorized and directed by agencies of the federal government prior to the incident nalco and its subsidiaries had not provided products or services or otherwise had any involvement with the deepwater horizon platform on july 15 2010 bp announced that it had capped the leaking well and the application of dispersants by the responding parties ceased shortly thereafter 

  

nalco company is a defendant in five putative class action lawsuits relating to the use of our corexit dispersant in the gulf of mexico in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill the actions as currently pleaded allege several causes of action including negligence and gross negligence the plaintiffs in these actions seek among other things compensatory and punitive damages medical monitoring and attorneys’ fees and costs in addition nalco company is a defendant in fifteen civil actions brought by individual 

  

  

plaintiffs that contains factual allegations substantially similar to the putative class action lawsuits against nalco company with the addition of claims of nuisance trespass battery and strict liability for the physical injuries and property damage allegedly sustained by the plaintiffs the plaintiffs in those actions seek among other things compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs 

  

all but two of these cases have been administratively transferred for pretrial purposes to a judge in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana with other related cases under in re oil spill by the oil rig “deepwater horizon” in the gulf of mexico on april 20 2010 case no 10md02179 ed la the “mdl” pursuant to orders issued in the mdl the claims have been consolidated in several master complaints including one naming nalco and others who responded to the gulf oil spill known as the “b3 bundle” at this time we do not know how many cases will be in the b3 bundle a tentative list of cases includes fifteen cases including some putative class actions in the b3 bundle six cases previously filed against nalco are not included in the b3 bundle the two cases that have not been consolidated in the mdl are pending in state court in mississippi and louisiana 

  

nalco company  the incident defendants and the other responder defendants have been named as third party defendants by transocean deepwater drilling inc and its affiliates the “transocean entities” in re the complaint and petition of triton asset leasing gmbh et al mdl no 2179 civil action 102771 in april and may 2011 the transocean entities cameron international corporation halliburton energy services inc mi llc weatherford us lp and weatherford international inc collectively the “cross claimants” filed cross claims in mdl 2179 against nalco company and other unaffiliated cross defendants the cross claimants generally allege among other things that if they are found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response they are entitled to indemnity or contribution from the cross defendants 

  

in april and june 2011 in support of its defense of the claims against it nalco company filed counterclaims against the cross claimants in its counterclaims nalco company generally alleges that if it is found liable for damages resulting from the deepwater horizon explosion oil spill andor spill response it is entitled to contribution or indemnity from the cross claimants 

  

we believe the claims against nalco are without merit and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously we also believe that we have rights to contribution andor indemnification including legal expenses from third parties however we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits the involvement we might have in these matters in the future or the potential for future litigation accordingly these lawsuits could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operation financial position and cash flows 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we have substantial indebtedness following the nalco merger which will impact our financial flexibility as of december 31 2011 we had net debt of 58 billion our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business consolidated results of operations and financial position including in the following respects 

  

  

·   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to debt service obligations thereby potentially reducing the availability of cash flows to pay cash dividends and to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general operating requirements and opportunities 

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions investments debt service obligations and other general operating requirements 

  

·   placing us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt 

  

·   limiting flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations and 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

  

in addition approximately 10 billion of our debt is floating rate debt a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt would increase future interest expense by approximately 10 million per year accordingly a significant spike in interest rates would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we incur additional indebtedness the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify 

  

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure the size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public while we have invested heavily in protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare food processing and pulp and paper industries as well as other industries we serve have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the 

  

  

foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we will incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the merger   the nalco merger is treated as an acquisition of nalco by ecolab for accounting purposes both ecolab and nalco have in the past expanded their operations through other acquisitions and joint ventures involving businesses owned by third parties ecolab expects to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future in connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill our merger with nalco resulted in goodwill of 44 billion which will ultimately be maintained in separate reporting units if it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in this case the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment this writedown of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a noncash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs if we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the nalco merger or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment impairment losses could be significant and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

  

future events may impact our deferred tax position including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely   we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on all available evidence this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in making this determination we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period future adjustments either increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets the realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position further should the company change its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates a deferred tax liability may need to be established 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not 

  

  

successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a downturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment 

  

the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of six business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to united states markets

we believe that we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and programs to institutions in the united states 

  

the institutional division sells its products and programs primarily through companyemployed field sales personnel we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice broadline and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers for accounts that prefer to purchase through these distributors many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers we generally provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers

gcs service  gcs service provides equipment repair and maintenance services for the commercial food service industry repair services are offered for inwarranty repair acting as the manufacturer’s authorized service agent as well as after warranty repair in addition gcs service operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and end users 

  

international segment 

  

we conduct business in approximately 72 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of venezuela through a joint venture with a local partner in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all of our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business healthcare and textile care are also significant businesses in our international operations particularly in europe kay has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quick service restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage we operate this business in various countries in asia pacific western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france and the united kingdom 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are also operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the smaller scale of international operations where many operating locations are smaller in size ii the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions and iii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions proportionately larger investments in sales technical support and administrative personnel are also necessary in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments 

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on ways to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition to our consultative approach we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above 

  

  

number of employees  we had approximately 26500 employees as of december 31 2010 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick service chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2010 2009 and 2008 approximated 19 percent of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses around the world we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2010 2009 and 2008 approximated 10 11 and 11 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark 

  

seasonality  we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 42 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 16 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and thirdparty logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 16 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels our healthcare division purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials 

  

  

used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 36 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts minnesota and oregon environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date and in 2010 were considered by several other state legislatures cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation was reintroduced in the us congress in 2010 but did not pass and several states including california and new york are considering further regulations in this area to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are being discussed in the us congress the us environmental protection agency epa is also more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern ecolab anticipates that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has enacted a new regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe ecolab has met the preregistration requirements of reach the 2010 registration deadline and is on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2013 and beyond to help manage 

  

  

this new program ecolab is simplifying its product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements the impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation and a few countries already have done so the primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation the impact of ghs will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 210 product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 3000000 in 2010 and 3100000 in 2009 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive “bpd” established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the bpd and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the multiyear bpd phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

fda medical device and drug product requirements  as a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing packaging labeling and marketing of medical devices and manufacturing procedures relating to these devices we also are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements eg iso standard 13485 we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical and other waste no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse 

  

  

effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 5700000 in 2010 and 3768000 in 2009 approximately 10800000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2011 

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly applies to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab has joined us epa’s climate leaders program and as part of that program we have pledged a us ghg emission reduction goal of 20 per dollar sales from 2006 to 2012 to achieve this target we have developed a ghg inventory of the six major greenhouse gases and report progress annually based on detailed us epa protocols and guidance 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 15 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at five sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately  1300000 in 2010 and 1725000 in 2009 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2010 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 2600000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled forwardlooking statements located on page 2 of this form 10k 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care and food processing industries can adversely impact our endusers who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities the decline in economic activity following the 2008 financial crisis has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect these markets during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy capital flows interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets while these disruptions generally subsided in 2010 allowing for a modest economic recovery there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the markets in which we operate as a result disruption in the global economy could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives our business could be adversely affected  we continue to make investments and execute business initiatives to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns in particular in february 2011 we announced various initiatives to capture financial and operational benefits in our european business in part by leveraging our new erp system and to improve our competitiveness in the region if the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no 

  

  

assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and in recent years we have experienced periods of increased raw material costs changes in oil or raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers or otherwise impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value innovation and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous global national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally including employment and labor laws compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  our multiyear contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare and food processing industries have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and consolidated results of operations 

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters e water shortages or f severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters water shortages or severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a downturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us

item 1b financial information about operating segments  

  

the financial information about reportable segments appearing under the heading “operating segments” in note 16 located on pages 52 and 53 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

  

item 1c narrative description of business  

  

general  ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the hospitality foodservice healthcare and industrial markets we provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs as well as pest elimination maintenance and repair services primarily to customers in the foodservice food and beverage processing hospitality healthcare government and education retail textile care commercial facilities management and vehicle wash sectors a strong commitment to customer support and sustainable solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of our business additional information on our business philosophy is found below under the heading “additional information — competition” of this item 1c 

  

the following description of our business is based upon our three reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements however we pursue a “circle the customer — circle the globe” strategy by providing products systems and services which serve our customer base and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers’ various operations around the world therefore one customer may utilize the products or services of all three of the segments and there is interdependence among the operating segments 

  

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment   the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of six business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to united states markets 

  

institutional  the institutional division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and healthcare customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as food safety products and equipment water filters dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries the institutional division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality health care and commercial facilities the institutional division develops and markets various chemical dispensing device systems which are made available to customers to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers in addition the institutional division markets a lease program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance 

  

we believe that we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and programs to institutions in the united states 

  

the institutional division sells its products and programs primarily through companyemployed field sales personnel we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice broadline and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers for accounts that prefer to purchase through these distributors many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers we generally provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers 

  

food  beverage  our food  beverage division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the beginning of the food chain to facilitate the processing of products for human consumption the division provides detergents cleaners sanitizers lubricants and animal health products as well as cleaning systems electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products primarily to dairy plants dairy farms breweries softdrink bottling plants and meat poultry and other food processors the food  beverage division is also a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct contact with meat poultry seafood and produce during processing in order to reduce microbial contamination the food  beverage division also designs engineers and installs cip “cleaninplace” process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base farm products are sold through dealers and independent thirdparty distributors while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel the food  beverage division also offers water care programs primarily to treat water used for heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes in addition through its ecovation business the food  beverage division offers customized 

  

  

wastewater treatment solutions that also can generate energy 

  

we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant dairy farm food meat and poultry and beveragebrewery processor industries in the united states 

  

kay  our kay division which consists of certain whollyowned subsidiaries of ecolab inc supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to national and regional quick service restaurant chains kay’s products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products and assorted cleaning tools products are sold under the “kay” brand or the customer’s private label in addition kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers kay’s customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels cleaning performance equipment life and safety levels 

  

kay employs a direct field sales force which establishes contracts or relationships with national and regional quick service restaurants and franchisees although the products are sold to distributors who then supply the chain’s or franchisee’s units 

  

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick service restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick service restaurant chains and franchisees 

  

in addition through kay’s food retail business the division supplies cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail ie grocery store industry food retail contracts with national and regional food retailers while products are sold primarily through distributors in fulfillment of those contracts products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products assorted cleaning tools and floor care products we provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by distributors as to direct customers 

  

healthcare  our healthcare division provides infection prevention and other healthcare related offerings to acute care hospitals surgery centers dental offices and veterinary clinics the healthcare division’s proprietary infection prevention products hand hygiene hard surface disinfectants instrument cleaners patient drapes fluid control products and equipment drapes are sold primarily under the “ecolab” and “microtek” brand names to various departments within the acute care environment infection control environmental services central sterile and operating room the healthcare division’s microtek medical business is a leader in niche branded specialty surgical drapes and fluid control products the healthcare division sells its products and programs primarily through companyemployed field sales personnel but also sells through healthcare distributors

united states other services segment   the “united states other services” segment is comprised of two business units pest elimination and gcs service in general these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend 

  

  

our product offering to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

  

pest elimination  our pest elimination division provides services designed to detect eliminate and prevent pests such as rodents and insects in restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quick service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers these services are sold and performed by companyemployed field sales and service personnel in addition through our ecosure food safety management business we provide customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations 

  

gcs service  gcs service provides equipment repair and maintenance services for the commercial food service industry repair services are offered for inwarranty repair acting as the manufacturer’s authorized service agent as well as after warranty repair in addition gcs service operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and end users 

  

international segment   we conduct business in approximately 72 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel and venezuela through joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all of our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business healthcare and textile care are also significant businesses in our international operations particularly in europe kay has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quick service restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage since 2001 we have entered markets in asia western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france and the united kingdom 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are also operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states due to i the smaller scale of international operations where many operating locations are smaller in size ii the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions and iii higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions proportionately larger investments in sales technical support and administrative personnel are also necessary in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments 

  

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on ways to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition to our consultative approach we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above 

  

number of employees  we had approximately 26000 employees as of december 31 2009 

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick service chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2009 2008 and 2007 approximated 19 19 and 20 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2009 2008 and 2007 approximated 11 11 and 10 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark 

  

seasonality  we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 54 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements 

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyoperated manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public logistics service providers we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors for transport additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids phosphorous materials silicates and salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels our healthcare division purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers 

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 48 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below 

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts minnesota and oregon environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in five states and in 2009 were considered in 17 additional states cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation was introduced in the us congress in 2009 to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date 

  

tsca  reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and an update of the chemicals on the tsca inventory the socalled “reset” of the tsca inventory are being discussed in the us congress the us environmental protection agency epa is 

  

  

also more aggressively using the existing tsca tools to manage chemicals of concern ecolab anticipates that compliance with new requirements under tsca could be similar to the costs associated with reach in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union is enacting the regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency “echa” in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe ecolab has met the preregistration requirements of reach and is on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2010 and beyond to help manage this new program ecolab is simplifying its product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements the impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets “sdss” most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation the primary cost of compliance will revolve around reclassifying products and revising sdss and product labels and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate the costs of ghs implementation the impact of ghs will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 270 product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 3100000 in 2009 and 3308000 in 2008 

  

in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec “bpd” established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the bpd and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the bpd phasein period will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda codifies “good manufacturing practices” for these products in order to ensure product quality safety and effectiveness the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

as a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we also are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state local and foreign governments in which we sell our products these regulations govern the development testing packaging labeling and marketing of medical devices and manufacturing procedures relating to these devices we also are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the united states and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing testing and control activities countries in the european union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “ce mark” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements we have ce mark approval to sell various medical device products in europe our other international noneuropean operations also are subject to government regulation and countryspecific rules and regulations regulators at the federal state and local level have imposed are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medical and other waste no prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products 

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 3768000 in 2009 and 8900000 in 2008 approximately 9000000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2010 

  

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly applies to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab has joined us epa’s climate leaders program and as part of that program we have pledged a us ghg emission reduction goal of 20 per dollar sales from 2006 to 2012 to achieve this target we have developed a ghg inventory of the six major greenhouse gases and report progress annually based on detailed us epa protocols and guidance 

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 15 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at seven sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 1725000 in 2009 and 614000 in 2008 our worldwide accruals at december 31 2009 for probable future remediation expenditures excluding potential insurance reimbursements totaled approximately 3878000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve  economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care and food processing industries can adversely impact our endusers who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities the recent decline in economic activity is adversely affecting these markets during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our business in the future in 2008 and 2009 the global economy experienced considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption was particularly acute in the global credit markets while these disruptions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the markets in which we operate as a result ongoing disruption in the global economy could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and have increased significantly in recent years changes in oil or raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition recent volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers or otherwise impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business 

  

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value product offerings and customer support  our competitive market is made up of numerous national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to timely introduce new technologies on a timely basis we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results  we enter into multiyear contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results  customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare and food processing industries have been consolidating in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and operating income 

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on business investments our business could be adversely affected  we are making investments to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns if the projects in which we are investing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with governmental regulations and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  our business is subject to numerous regulations relating to the environment including evolving climate change standards and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products compliance with these regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance changes to current laws including tax laws regulations and policies could impose new restrictions costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits in addition changes in accounting standards including the adoption effective january 1 2007 of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” could increase the volatility of our quarterly tax rate 

  

  

severe public health outbreaks may adversely impact our business  our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a public health epidemic the united states and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future public health outbreaks such as avian flu sars and h1n1 influenza a prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business  the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters or e severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters or severe weather conditions affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a downturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business  our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us

the following description of our business is based upon our three reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements however we pursue a “circle the customer — circle the globe” strategy by providing products systems and services which serve our customer base and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers’ various operations around the world therefore one customer may utilize the products or services of all three of the segments and there is interdependence among the operating segments 

  

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment   the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of six business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to united states markets 

  

institutional  the institutional division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and healthcare customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as food safety products and equipment dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry the institutional division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality health care and commercial facilities the institutional division manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems which are made available to customers to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers in addition the institutional division markets a lease program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance

  

we believe that we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and programs to institutions in the united states 

  

the institutional division sells its products and programs primarily through companyemployed field sales personnel however to a significant degree we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through distributors we provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers 

  

food  beverage  our food  beverage division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the beginning of the food chain to facilitate the processing of products for human consumption the division provides detergents cleaners sanitizers lubricants and animal health products as well as cleaning systems electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products primarily to dairy plants dairy farms breweries softdrink bottling plants and meat poultry and other food processors the food  beverage division is also a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct contact with meat poultry seafood and produce during processing in order to reduce microbial contamination the food  beverage division also designs engineers and installs cip “cleaninplace” process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base farm products are sold through dealers and independent thirdparty distributors while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel the food  beverage division also offers water care programs primarily to treat water used for heating and cooling systems and manufacturing processes in addition through its ecovation business the food  beverage division offers customized wastewater treatment solutions that also can generate energy

  

  

we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant dairy farm food meat and poultry and beveragebrewery processor industries in the united states 

  

kay  our kay division which consists of certain whollyowned subsidiaries of ecolab inc supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to national and regional quick service restaurant chains kay’s products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products and assorted cleaning tools products are sold under the “kay” brand or the customer’s private label in addition kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers kay’s customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels cleaning performance equipment life and safety levels

  

kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quick service restaurants and franchisees although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units 

  

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quick service restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quick service restaurant chains and franchisees 

  

in addition through kay’s food retail business the division supplies cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail ie grocery store industry food retail products are sold primarily through distributors and include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products assorted cleaning tools and floor care products we provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by distributors as to direct customers

united states other services segment   the “united states other services” segment is comprised of two business units pest elimination and gcs service in general these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

  

  

pest elimination  our pest elimination division provides services designed to detect eliminate and prevent pests in restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quick service restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers these services are sold and performed by companyemployed field sales and service personnel in addition through our ecosure food safety management business we provide customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations

international segment   we conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel and venezuela through joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business healthcare and textile care are also significant businesses in our international operations particularly in europe kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quick service restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage since 2001 we have entered markets in asia western europe latin america and south africa with the largest operations in france and the united kingdom 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are also operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing 

  

  

dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on ways to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition to our consultative approach we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above

  

number of employees  we had approximately 26500 employees as of december 31 2008

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quick service chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2008 2007 and 2006 approximated 21 22 and 21 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2008 2007 and 2006 approximated 11 10 and 10 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property including through a license agreement with henkel ag  co kgaa while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

  

seasonality  overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality however we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 51 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyowned manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties”

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids phosphates silicates and salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 44 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california “green” chemistry initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts and vermont in 2009 green chemistry and ingredient disclosure legislation may be introduced at the federal level to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

  

reauthorization of the toxic substances control act “tsca” and a reset of the tsca inventory are being discussed in the us congress ecolab anticipates that compliance with new requirements could be similar to the costs associated with the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals regulation recently adopted in the european union which is discussed below 

  

reach  the european union has developed a new regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” it established a new european chemicals agency in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe under reach all “new” and “existing” chemicals produced or imported into the european union in quantities above one ton per year must be 

  

  

registered in a central database ecolab has met the preregistration requirements of reach and is on track to meet the upcoming deadlines and requirements in 2009 and beyond to help manage this new program ecolab is simplifying its product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements for chemicals deemed to be of most concern industry must gain specific authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe ecolab has minimized use of these chemicals which are designated as “chemicals of high concern” the impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

ghs  in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized safety labeling and safety warnings individual countries and regional organizations either have begun to implement ghs or are considering what portions of it will be adopted and within what timeframe most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation the primary cost of compliance will revolve around authoring of material safety data sheets and product labeling and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate risks of ghs implementation potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

pesticide and biocide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 330 product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 3308000 in 2008 and 2800000 in 2007

  

in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec “bpd” established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the bpd and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs which will be incurred through the bpd phasein period ending in 2014 will be significant however these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with 

  

  

federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the united states are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water similar legal requirements apply to ecolab’s facilities globally we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 8900000 in 2008 and 8100000 in 2007 approximately 4200000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2009

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions none of these laws and regulations directly applies to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab has joined us epa’s climate leaders program and as part of that program we have pledged to develop a corporatewide us ghg emission inventory and work with epa to set a ghg reduction goal

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 17 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation pursuant to an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel ag  co kgaa henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties’ former joint venture in europe we have requested euro 261046 approximately 368000 at december 31 2008 from henkel for environmental costs during 2008

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which 

  

  

we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 614000 in 2008 and 1060000 in 2007 including the chemlawn matter described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2008 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 3751000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there is one such location and chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs for the one remaining site

 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled forwardlooking statements located on page 2 of this form 10k 

  

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements made in oral presentations including telephone conferences andor webcasts open to the public 

  

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care and food processing industries can adversely impact our endusers who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities the current decline in economic activity is adversely affecting these markets during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products which would likely in turn have an adverse impact on our business

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and are expected to have a material adverse impact on our business in the future the global economy is currently experiencing considerable disruption and volatility and the disruption has been particularly acute in the global credit markets while currently these disruptions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the markets in which we operate as a result ongoing disruption in the global economy could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate from time to time and have increased significantly in recent years changes in oil or raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition recent volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers or otherwise impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms which may adversely affect our business

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value product offerings and customer support our competitive market is made up of numerous national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to timely introduce new technologies we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results we enter into multiyear contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality travel healthcare and food processing industries have been consolidating in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and operating income

  

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on business investments our business could be adversely affected we are making investments to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns if the projects in which we are investing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with governmental regulations our business is subject to numerous regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products compliance with these regulations as well as changes in tax fiscal governmental and other regulatory policies expose us to potential financial liability and increase our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance in addition changes in accounting standards including the adoption effective january 1 2007 of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” could increase the volatility of our quarterly tax rate

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters or e severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a significant adverse impact on our business

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters or severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a downturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business our continued success will largely depend on 

  

  

our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment   

the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of seven business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to united states markets

kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quickservice restaurants and franchisees although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units 

  

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quickservice restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quickservice restaurant chains and franchisees kay continues to seek growth and diversification opportunities

the “united states other services” segment is comprised of two business units pest elimination and gcs service in general these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

  

pest elimination  our pest elimination division provides services for the detection elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quickservice restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers these services are sold and performed by companyemployed sales and service personnel in addition through our ecosure food safety management business we provide customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations

international segment   

we conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel and venezuela through joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america 

  

  

and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage since 2001 we have entered markets in asia western europe and latin america with the largest operations in france and the united kingdom 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customer protect its brand reputation value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above

  

number of employees  we have approximately 26050 employees

  

  

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quickservice chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2007 2006 and 2005 approximated 22 21 and 21 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2007 2006 and 2005 approximated 10 10 and 11 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property including through a license agreement with henkel kgaa while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

  

seasonality  overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality however we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 47 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyowned manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers including henkel kgaa other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 16 of this form 10k under the heading “properties”

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page16 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including alkalis acids phosphates silicates and salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers

  

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 41 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california “green” chemistry initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states including california maine massachusetts and vermont to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

  

pesticide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 350 product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 2800000 in 2007 and 3400000 in 2006 in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec “bpd” established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products we are working with suppliers and industry

  

  

groups to manage requirements associated with the bpd and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

europe  the european union is developing a new regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach the european parliament and council adopted the reach regulation in december 2006 which became effective in june 2007 it established a new european chemicals agency in helsinki finland which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe all “new” and “existing” chemicals produced or imported into the european union in quantities above one ton per year must be registered in a central database for chemicals deemed to be of most concern industry must gain specific authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe other uses would be prohibited to manage this new program we are simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements the eventual impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

in 2003 the united nations issued a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals “ghs” ghs is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide uniform system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized safety labeling and safety warnings individual countries and regional organizations either have begun to implement ghs or are considering what portions of it will be adopted and within what timeframe most countries in which we operate will adopt ghsrelated legislation the primary cost of compliance will revolve around labeling and we are working toward a phasedin approach to mitigate risks of ghs implementation potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 8100000 in 2007 and 6400000 in 2006 approximately 7800000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2008

  

climate change  various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international national regional and state levels particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions none of these laws and regulations directly applies to ecolab at the present time however as a matter of corporate policy ecolab supports a balanced approach to reducing ghg emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness ecolab has joined us epa’s climate leaders program and as part of that program we have pledged to develop a corporatewide us ghg emission inventory and work with epa to set a ghg reduction goal in 2008

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 19 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at nine sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp that actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation pursuant to an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel kgaa henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties’ former joint venture in europe we received euro 626763 approximately 917000 from henkel in 2007 for such environmental liabilities and we recently requested an additional euro 203890 approximately 300000 at december 31 2007 for new environmental costs

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 1060000 in 2007 and 950000 in 2006 including the chemlawn matters described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2007 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 3990000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there are five such locations and at each chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs

 item 1a risk factors  

  

the following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this form 10k see the section entitled forwardlooking statements located on page 2 of this form 10k 

  

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements made in oral presentations including telephone conference andor webcasts open to the public 

  

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

  

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care and food processing industries can adversely impact our endusers who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning hygiene and appearance products which would likely in turn have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cas h flows

  

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value product offerings and customer support   our competitive market is made up of numerous national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to timely introduce new technologies we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results   we enter into multiyear contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income 

  

consolidation of our customers and vendors can affect our results customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality and lodging industry have been consolidating in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and operating income 

  

  

our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials   the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate significantly from time to time and have increased in recent years changes in oil or raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect ou r consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

if we are unsuccessful in executing on business investments our business could be adversely affected   we are making investments to develop business systems and optimize our business structure as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns if the projects in which we are investing are not successfully executed our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected

  

our business depends on our ability to comply with governmental regulations   our business is subject to numerous regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products compliance with these regulations as well as changes in tax fiscal governmental and other regulatory policies expose us to potential financial liability and increase our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance in addition changes in accounting standards including the adoption effective january 1 2007 of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” could increase the volatility of our quarterly tax rate 

  

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors economic factors such as the worldwide economy interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows in the future 

  

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business   the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters or e severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a significant adverse impact on our business 

  

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement wage hour and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

  

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

  

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters or severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a d ownturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business   o ur continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us

item 1c narrative description of business  

general    ecolab develops and markets premium products and services for the hospitality foodservice healthcare and industrial markets we provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs as well as pest elimination maintenance and repair services primarily to hotels and restaurants healthcare and educational facilities quickservice fastfood and other convenience store units grocery stores commercial and institutional laundries light industry dairy plants and farms food and beverage processors and the vehicle wash industry a strong commitment to customer support is a distinguishing characteristic of our business additional information on our business philosophy is found below under the heading “additional information — competition” of this item 1c

the following description of our business is based upon our three reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements however we pursue a “circle the customer — circle the globe” strategy by providing products systems and services which serve our customer base and do so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers’ various operations around the world therefore one customer may utilize the products or services of all three of the segments and there is interdependence among the operating segments revenues of our international segment include sales outside the united states by our kay and pest elimination businesses 

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of seven business units which provide cleaning and sanitizing products and programs to united states markets 

institutional  our institutional division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and health care customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as food safety products and equipment dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry the institutional division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers the institutional division manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems which are made available to customers to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers in addition the institutional division markets a lease program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance

we believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products and programs to institutions in the united states 

the institutional division sells its products and programs primarily through companyemployed field sales and service personnel however to a significant degree we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors we provide the same customer support to accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers 

effective january 1 2007 we integrated our former professional products division into the institutional division to deliver a broad range of cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality health care and commercial facilities the institutional sales force along with a network of independent thirdparty distributors serving the commercial janitorial industry market professional products’ proprietary offerings detergents general purpose cleaners carpet care stone care furniture polishes disinfectants floor care products hand soaps and odor counteractants 

kay  our kay division which consists of certain whollyowned subsidiaries of ecolab inc supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to national and regional quickservice restaurant chains and to the food retail ie grocery store industry kay’s products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners degreasers sanitizers polishes hand care products and 

  

assorted cleaning tools products are sold under the “kay” brand or the customer’s private label in addition kay supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers kay’s customized cleaning and sanitation programs are designed to reduce labor costs and product usage while increasing sanitation levels cleaning performance equipment life and safety levels 

kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quickservice restaurant franchisee and food retail chain headquarters although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units 

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quickservice restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quickservice restaurant chains and franchisees kay continues to seek growth and diversification opportunities 

food  beverage  our food  beverage division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the beginning of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption the division provides detergents cleaners sanitizers lubricants and animal health products as well as cleaning systems electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products primarily to dairy plants dairy farms breweries softdrink bottling plants and meat poultry and other food processors the food  beverage division is also a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct contact with meat poultry seafood and produce during processing in order to reduce microbial contamination on those surfaces the division also designs engineers and installs cip “cleaninplace” process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base farm products are sold through dealers and independent thirdparty distributors while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel

we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant dairy farm food meat and poultry and beveragebrewery processor industries in the united states 

textile care  our textile care division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems as well as related programs to large industrial and commercial laundries typically these customers process a minimum of 1000000 pounds of linen each year and include freestanding laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries products and programs include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment which are marketed primarily through a companyemployed sales force and to a lesser extent through independent thirdparty distributors the division’s programs are designed to meet our customer’s need for exceptional cleaning while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customer’s overall operating cost

united states other services segment the “united states other services” segment is comprised of two business units pest elimination and gcs service in general these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

pest elimination  our pest elimination division provides services for the detection elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quickservice restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers these services are sold and performed by companyemployed sales and service personnel in addition through our ecosure food safety management business the division provides customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations

gcs service  gcs service provides commercial cooking and refrigeration equipment repair and maintenance services for restaurant and other foodservice operations repair services are offered for inwarranty repair acting as the manufacturer’s authorized service agent as well as after warranty repair in addition gcs service offers parts at a wholesale level to repair service companies and end users

international segment we conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel the united arab emirates and venezuela through joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states but are managed on a geographic basis the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

our pest elimination business continues to expand its geographic coverage since 2001 we have entered markets in brazil chile the united kingdom ireland france and south africa primarily through acquisitions 

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada 

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and 

  

political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

additional information 

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on customer support product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium customer support and differentiated products value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation programs to our customers and to provide that level of customer support to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer — circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

sales and service  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above

number of employees  we have approximately 23130 employees

customers and classes of products  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quickservice chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2006 2005 and 2004 approximated 21 21 and 22 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and provide customer support to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2006 2005 and 2004 approximated 10 11 and 10 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property including through a license agreement with henkel kgaa while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

  

seasonality  overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality however we do experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments note 17 entitled “quarterly financial data” located on page 47 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyowned manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers including henkel kgaa other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties”

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 15 of this form 10k under the heading “properties” 

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including phosphates silicates alkalis salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 40 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal and plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

pesticide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill or reduce microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on hard environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 400 product registrations with the us environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 3400000 in 2006 and 2900000 in 2005 in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec is establishing a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products the biocidal product directive requirements are transitioning into effect in september 2006 certain biocidal active substances not notified to the european chemicals bureau were required to be withdrawn from the market we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the biocidal products directive anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” however the us department of agriculture and epa also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food the fda also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 that may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such 

  

requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

europe  the european union is developing a new regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach the european parliament and council adopted the reach regulation in december 2006 and it will enter into force in june 2007 reach will establish a new european chemicals agency in helsinki finland the agency would be responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe all “new” and “existing” chemicals produced or imported into the european union in quantities above one ton per year must be registered in a central database for chemicals deemed to be of most concern industry must gain specific authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe other uses would be prohibited to manage this new program we are simplifying our product line and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements the eventual impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects worldwide were approximately 6410000 in 2006 and 4230000 in 2005 approximately 9370000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2007

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 22 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation pursuant to an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel kgaa henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties’ former joint venture in europe reimbursement from henkel has been requested for 647924 euro or approximately 855000 spent for such environmental liabilities prior to december 31 2006

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 950000 in 2006 and 1240000 in 2005 including the chemlawn matters described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2006 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 4900000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there are five such locations and at each chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs

we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements made in oral presentations including telephone conference andor webcasts open to the public 

except as may be required under applicable law we undertake no duty to update our forwardlooking statements 

our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve economic downturns and in particular downturns in the foodservice hospitality travel health care and food processing industries can adversely impact our endusers who are sensitive to changes in travel and dining activities during such downturns these endusers typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning hygiene and appearance products which would likely in turn have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows

our growth depends upon our ability to successfully compete with respect to value product offerings and customer support   our competitive market is made up of numerous national regional and local competitors our ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize innovative high valueadded products for niche applications there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this or that technological developments by our competitors will not place certain of our products at a competitive disadvantage in the future in addition certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets if we fail to timely introduce new technologies we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected

we enter into multiyear contracts with customers that can impact our results   we enter into multiyear contracts with some of our customers which include terms affecting our pricing flexibility there can be no assurance that these restraints will not have an adverse impact on our margins and operating income

consolidation of our customer and vendors can affect our results customers and vendors in the foodservice hospitality and lodging industry have been consolidating in recent years and that trend may continue this consolidation could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our margins and operating income

our results can be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials   the prices of raw materials used in our business can fluctuate significantly from time to time and have increased in recent years changes in oil or raw material prices unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

if we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be adversely affected  as part of our longterm strategy we seek to acquire complementary businesses there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses into existing businesses if the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected

our business depends on our ability to comply with governmental regulations   our business is subject to numerous regulations relating to the environment and to the manufacture storage distribution sale and use of our products compliance with these regulations as well as changes in tax fiscal governmental and other regulatory policies expose us to potential financial liability and increase our operating costs regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs the potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and cleanup costs the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations and the timing and expense of compliance in addition changes in accounting standards including the adoption effective january 1 2007 of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” could increase the volatility of our quarterly tax rate

our results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors   economic factors such as the worldwide economy interest rates and currency movements including in particular our exposure to foreign currency risk have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows in the future

extraordinary events may significantly impact our business   the occurrence of a litigation or claims b the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor c war including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets d natural or manmade disasters or e severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries may have a significant adverse impact on our business

defense of litigation particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust patent infringement and class action lawsuits can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful and if not successful could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

while we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 

war including acts of terrorism or hostilities natural or manmade disasters or severe weather conditions or public health epidemics affecting the foodservice hospitality and travel industries cause a downturn in the business of restaurants motels and hotels and other of our customers which in turn can have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

we depend on key personnel to lead our business   our continued success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain a high caliber of talent and on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees our operations could be adversely affected if for any reason such officers or key employees did not remain with us

we conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel and venezuela through majorityowned joint ventures 

  

  

with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states although we customize our products and services to meet unique local requirements the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

through acquisitions we expanded our pest elimination business to brazil in 2001 the united kingdom and the republic of ireland in 2002 to france and south africa in 2004 and to chile in early 2005 in addition we entered the healthcare market in the united kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in late 2002 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on service product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value premium service and differentiated products value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and helping them comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to our customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general”

seasonality  overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements the investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading “cash flows” located on page 28 of the annual report and incorporated into item 7 hereof

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyowned manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers including henkel kgaa other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading “properties”

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 15 hereof under the heading “properties” 

  

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including phosphates silicates alkalis salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal or plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows to date

  

pesticide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain 

  

  

approximately 400 product registrations with the united states environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or the results of our operations to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 2900000 in 2005 and 2700000 in 2004 in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec is establishing a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products the biocidal product directive requirements are transitioning into effect in september 2006 certain biocidal active substances not notified to the european chemicals bureau will be withdrawn from the market we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the biocidal products directive anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals processed foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows

  

europe  the european union is developing a new regulatory framework for the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach it is expected that a final decision on reach will be made by the european parliament and council in autumn 2006 the commission expects the reach regulation to enter into force in spring 2007 with an implementation schedule to follow accordingly operational requirements of reach are expected to apply from 2008 onwards

  

reach is expected to establish a new european chemicals agency in helsinki finland the agency would be responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in europe all “new” and “existing” chemicals produced or imported 

  

  

into the eu in quantities above 1 ton per year must be registered in a central database for chemicals deemed to be of most concern industry must gain specific authorization for particular uses which have been demonstrated to be safe other uses would be prohibited 

  

to manage this new program we expect to simplify our product line and we are working with chemical suppliers to begin evaluating potential implications the eventual impact of reach will also be felt by our competitors potential costs to us are not yet quantifiable 

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air land and water we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects were approximately 4230000 in 2005 and 1810000 in 2004 approximately 7000000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2006

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at 21 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation pursuant to an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel kgaa henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties’ former joint venture in europe reimbursement from henkel has been requested for 42785 euro or approximately 52000 spent for such environmental liabilities prior to december 31 2005

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 800000 in 2005 and 500000 in 2004 including the chemlawn matters described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2005 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 4300000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there are five such locations and at each chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs

the rights have certain antitakeover effects the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the registrant on terms not approved by the registrant’s board of directors the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors of the registrant since the board of directors may at its option at any time until 10 business days following the stock acquisition date redeem all but no less than all of the then outstanding rights at the applicable redemption price

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment 

  

the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of eight divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to united states markets 

  

institutional  our institutional division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and health care customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as food safety products and equipment dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry the institutional division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers the institutional division also manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems which are made available to customers to dispense our cleaners and sanitizers in addition the institutional division markets a program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance

  

we believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the united states 

  

the institutional division sells its products and services primarily through companyemployed field salesandservice personnel however to a significant degree we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors we provide the same service to accounts supplied by food distributors as to direct customers 

  

kay  our kay division which consists of certain whollyowned subsidiaries of ecolab inc supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to the quickservice restaurant industry this includes traditional fastfood restaurants but also other retail locations where “fast food” is prepared and served such as convenience stores airport and shopping center kiosks and other public venues typically serviced by national or regional restaurant chains kay also sells cleaning and sanitizing products to the food retail ie grocery store industry kay’s products include specialty

kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quickservice restaurant and food retail chains and franchisees although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units 

  

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quickservice restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quickservice restaurant chains and franchisees kay continues to seek growth and diversification opportunities for example in 2004 kay launched a cleaning program for theaters 

  

food  beverage  our food  beverage division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption the division provides detergents cleaners sanitizers lubricants and animal health products as well as cleaning systems electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products primarily to dairy plants dairy farms breweries softdrink bottling plants and meat poultry and other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants the food  beverage division also designs engineers and installs cip “cleaninplace” process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base farm products are sold through dealers and independent thirdparty distributors while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel

international segment 

  

we conduct business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of israel and venezuela through majorityowned joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states although we customize our products and services to meet unique local requirements the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our 

  

  

international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

through acquisitions we expanded our pest elimination business to brazil in 2001 the united kingdom and the republic of ireland in september 2002 to france and south africa in 2004 and to chile in early 2005 in addition we entered the healthcare market in the united kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in december 2002 

  

our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on service product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value and differentiated products value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to our customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales and service  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above

  

number of employees  we have approximately 21300 employees

  

customers and classes of service  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quickservice

  

  

chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2004 2003 and 2002 approximated 22 23 and 23 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2004 2003 and 2002 approximated 10 10 and 11 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property including through a license agreement with henkel kgaa while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous substances waste disposal or plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation  various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to date

  

pesticide legislation  various international federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 400 product registrations with the united states environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or the results of our operations to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were

  

  

approximately 2700000 in 2004 and 2400000 in 2003 in europe the biocidal product directive 988ec is establishing a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products the biocidal product directive requirements are transitioning into effect in september 2006 certain biocidal active substances not notified to the european chemicals bureau will be withdrawn from the market we are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage requirements associated with the biocidal products directive anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals processed foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity

  

other environmental legislation  our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air land and water we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects were approximately 1810000 in 2004 and 1800000 in 2003 approximately 5900000 has been budgeted globally for projects in 2005

  

environmental remediation and proceedings  along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at approximately 20 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning

  

  

up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation pursuant to an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel kgaa henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the parties’ former joint venture in europe reimbursement from henkel has been requested for 42785 euro or approximately 55000 spent for such environmental liabilities prior to december 31 2004 

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 500000 in 2004 and 500000 in 2003 including the chemlawn matters described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2004 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 4100000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there are five such locations and at each chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs

the following description of business is based upon our three reportable segments “segments” as reported in ecolab’s consolidated financial statements however the company pursues a “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy by providing products systems and services which serve our customer base and does so on a global basis to meet the needs of our customers’ various operations around the world therefore one customer may utilize the services of all three of the segments and there is a degree of interdependence among the operating segments  particularly between the international cleaning  sanitizing and the united states cleaning  sanitizing businesses 

  

united states cleaning  sanitizing segment   

the “united states cleaning  sanitizing” segment is comprised of seven divisions which provide cleaning and sanitizing services to united states markets 

  

institutional  our institutional division is our largest division and sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes glassware flatware foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment “warewashing” for onpremise laundries typically used by hotel and health care customers and for general housekeeping functions as well as dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice lodging educational and healthcare industries and water filters to the foodservice industry the institutional division also provides pool and spa treatment programs for commercial and hospitality customers and through its facilitec business provides rooftop grease filter products and kitchen exhaust cleaning services for restaurants and other foodservice operations the institutional division also manufactures and markets various chemical dispensing device systems which are made available to customers to dispense the company’s cleaners and sanitizers in addition the institutional division markets primarily to smaller and midsize customer units a program comprised of energyefficient dishwashing machines detergents rinse additives and sanitizers including full machine maintenance

  

we believe we are the leading supplier of chemical warewashing products to institutions in the united states 

  

the institutional division sells its products and services primarily through companyemployed field salesandservice personnel however to a significant degree we also utilize independent thirdparty foodservice distributors to market and sell our products to smaller accounts or accounts which purchase through food distributors we provide the same service to accounts served by food distributors as to direct customers 

  

kay  our kay division which consists of certain whollyowned subsidiaries of ecolab inc supplies chemical cleaning and sanitizing products primarily to the quickservice restaurant industry this includes traditional fastfood restaurants but also other retail locations where “fast food” is

kay employs a direct field sales force which primarily calls upon national and regional quickservice restaurant and food retail chains and franchisees although the sales are made to distributors who supply the chain or franchisee’s units 

  

we believe that our kay division is the leading supplier of chemical cleaning and sanitizing products to the traditional quickservice restaurant industry in the united states while kay’s customer base has been growing kay’s business is largely dependent upon a limited number of major quickservice restaurant chains and franchisees 

  

food  beverage  our food  beverage division addresses cleaning and sanitation at the start of the food chain to facilitate the production of products for human consumption the division provides detergents cleaners sanitizers lubricants and animal health products as well as cleaning systems electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products primarily to dairy plants dairy farms breweries softdrink bottling plants and meat poultry and other food processors as well as to pharmaceutical and cosmetic plants the division also markets food irradiation services through an alliance with ion beam applications iba the food  beverage division also designs engineers and installs cip “cleaninplace” process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base   farm products are sold through dealers and independent thirdparty distributors while plant products are sold primarily by our field sales personnel

  

we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant dairy farm food meat and poultry and beveragebrewery processor industries in the united states 

  

textile care  our textile care division provides chemical laundry products and proprietary dispensing systems as well as related services to large industrial and commercial laundries typically these customers process a minimum of 1000000 pounds of linen each year and include freestanding laundry plants used by institutions such as hotels restaurants and healthcare facilities as well as industrial and textile rental laundries the division also serves the shirt laundry market typically comprised of smaller laundry units products and services include laundry cleaning and specialty products and related dispensing equipment which are marketed primarily through a companyemployed sales force and to a lesser extent through independent thirdparty distributors the division’s programs are designed to meet our customer’s need for exceptional cleaning while extending the useful life of linen and reducing the customer’s overall operating cost

  

professional products   the professional products division provides a broad range of janitorial and infection preventionhealthcare offerings to the janitorial and medical markets in the united states effective january 2004 we reorganized our businesses serving janitorial and healthcare customers by splitting the professional products group into two divisions professional products and healthcare professional products’ proprietary janitorial products detergents general purpose cleaners carpet care furniture polishes disinfectants floor care products hand soaps and odor counteractants are sold primarily under the brand name “airkem” these products are sold

united states other services segment   

the “united states other services” segment is comprised of two business units pest elimination and gcs service in general these businesses provide service or equipment which can augment or extend our product offering to our business customers as a part of our “circle the customer” approach 

  

pest elimination  our pest elimination division provides services for the detection elimination and prevention of pests to restaurants food and beverage processors educational and healthcare facilities hotels quickservice restaurant and grocery operations and other institutional and commercial customers these services are sold and performed by companyemployed sales and service personnel in addition through our ecosure food safety management business the division provides customized onsite evaluations training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations

  

gcs service  gcs provides commercial kitchen parts and equipment repair services including parts distribution gcs offers these services to restaurant and other foodservice operations while providing warranty service for equipment manufacturers in addition gcs offers parts at a wholesale level to repair services companies and end users

  

international cleaning  sanitizing segment   

the company conducts business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of china israel and venezuela through majorityowned joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues our largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa and the middle east 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states although we customize our products and services to meet unique local requirements the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in our international operations they are conducted in virtually all our international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall 

  

 

business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of kay’s international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains 

  

we expanded our pest elimination business to the united kingdom and the republic of ireland in september 2002 and to france in january 2004 through acquisitions in addition we entered the hospital hygiene market in the united kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in december 2002 our other businesses are conducted less extensively in our international locations however in general most of the principal businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada and mexico 

  

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of our international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of the international operations as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information 

  

competition  our business units have two significant classes of competitors first each business unit competes with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale second all of our business units have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies product lines andor enduser segments

  

our objective is to achieve a significant presence in each of our business markets in general competition is based on service product performance and price we believe we compete principally by providing superior value and differentiated products value is provided by stateoftheart cleaning sanitation and maintenance products and systems coupled with high customer support standards and continuing dedication to customer satisfaction this is made possible in part by our significant ongoing investment in training and technology and by our standard practice of advising customers on means to lower operating costs and comply with safety environmental and sanitation regulations in addition we emphasize our ability to uniformly provide a variety of related premium cleaning and sanitation services to our customers and to provide that level of service to multiple locations of chain customer organizations worldwide this approach is succinctly stated in our “circle the customer  circle the globe” strategy which is discussed above in this item 1c under the heading “general” 

  

sales and service  products systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by companytrained sales and service personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation needs independent thirdparty distributors are utilized in several markets as described in the business unit descriptions found under the discussion of the three reportable segments above

  

customers and classes of service  we believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer although as described above in this item 1c under the description of the kay business kay is largely dependent upon a limited number of national and international quickservice chains and franchisees additionally although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes ten percent or more of our consolidated revenues we do have customers and independent thirdparty distributors for example aramark compass sodexho sysco and us foodservice the loss of which could have a material negative effect on results of operations

  

 

for the affected earnings periods however we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the company no material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit we sell two classes of products which each constitute 10 percent or more of our sales sales of warewashing products in 2003 2002 and 2001 approximated 23 23 and 26 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales in addition through our institutional and textile care businesses we sell laundry products and services to a broad range of laundry customers sales of laundry products and services in 2003 2002 and 2001 approximated 10 11 and 10 percent respectively of our consolidated net sales sales of our european operations are reflected in these percentages beginning in 2002 

  

patents and trademarks  we own and license a number of patents trademarks and other intellectual property including a license agreement with henkel kgaa while we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action when appropriate to prevent infringement we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark

  

seasonality  overall our business does not have a significant degree of seasonality

  

working capital  we have invested in the past and will continue to invest in the future in merchandising equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our cleaning and sanitizing products otherwise we have no unusual working capital requirements the investment in merchandising equipment is discussed under the heading “cash flows” located on page 28 of the annual report and incorporated into item 7 hereof

  

manufacturing and distribution  we manufacture most of our products and related equipment in companyowned manufacturing facilities some products are also produced for us by thirdparty contract manufacturers including henkel kgaa other products and equipment are purchased from thirdparty suppliers additional information on productequipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading “properties”

  

deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and public warehouses we use common carriers our own delivery vehicles and distributors additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located beginning at page 14 hereof under the heading “properties” 

  

raw materials  raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals including phosphates silicates alkalies salts and organic chemicals including surfactants and solvents these materials are generally purchased on an annual contract basis from a diverse group of chemical manufacturers when practical we use global sourcing for production as well as for purchasing raw materials so that our operations can be shifted among locations worldwide to control product costs at globally competitive levels pesticides used by our pest elimination division are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors we also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems most raw materials or substitutes for those materials used by us with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture are available from several suppliers

  

research and development  our research and development program consists principally of devising and testing new products processes techniques and equipment improving the efficiency of existing ones improving service program content and evaluating the environmental compatibility of products key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry microbiology process and packaging engineering and product dispensing technology substantially all of our principal

  

 

products have been developed by our research development and engineering personnel at times technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings note 13 entitled “research expenditures” located on page 44 of the annual report is incorporated herein by reference 

  

environmental and regulatory considerations  our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health while we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects some risks are inherent in our businesses among the risks are costs associated with managing hazardous substances waste disposal or plant site cleanup fines and penalties if we were found to be in violation of law as well as modifications disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls additionally although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below

  

ingredient legislation   various laws and regulations have been enacted by state local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous volatile organic compounds or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment under california proposition 65 label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by california to date we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications such legislation has not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity to date

  

pesticide legislation   various federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture andor use of pesticides we manufacture and sell certain disinfecting and sanitizing products which kill microorganisms bacteria viruses fungi on environmental surfaces and on certain food products such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” as amended by the food quality protection act of 1996 the principal federal statute governing the manufacture labeling handling and use of pesticides we maintain approximately 400 product registrations with the united states environmental protection agency “epa” registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay ongoing registration fees in addition each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee in general the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by fifra however california and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs and california imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state while the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or the results of our operations to date the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products have increased in recent years total fees paid to the epa and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations and for the california tax were approximately 2400000 in 2003 and 2500000 in 2002 congress is evaluating legislation that would increase these fees absent such a change anticipated registration costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity

  

 

in addition our pest elimination division applies restricteduse pesticides which it generally purchases from third parties that division must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations we have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements 

  

fda antimicrobial product requirements  various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal state local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals processed foods and medical devices in the united states these requirements generally are administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda has been expanding requirements applicable to such products including proposing regulations in a tentative final monograph for healthcare antiseptic drug products dated june 17 1994 that may impose additional requirements and associated costs when finalized by the fda to date such requirements have not had a material negative effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity

  

other environmental legislation   our manufacturing plants are subject to federal state local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation handling and disposal of such substances the primary federal statutes that apply to our activities are the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” we are also subject to the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of toxic substances into the air land and water we make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations to ensure employee safety and to carry out its announced environmental stewardship principles to date such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity our capital expenditures for environmental health and safety projects were approximately 1800000 for 2003 and 1600000 for 2002 approximately 3600000 has been budgeted globally for 2004

  

environmental remediation and proceedings    along with numerous other potentially responsible parties “prps” we are currently involved with waste disposal site cleanup activities imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or state equivalents at approximately 20 sites in the united states additionally we have similar liability at eight sites outside the united states in general under cercla we and each other prp which actually contributes hazardous substances to a superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site customarily the prps will work with the epa to agree and implement a plan for site remediation

  

based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other prps which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual in establishing accruals potential insurance 

  

 

reimbursements are not included the accrual is not discounted it is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes 

  

our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately 500000 in 2003 and 500000 in 2002 including the chemlawn matters described below our worldwide accruals at december 31 2003 for probable future remediation expenditures totaled approximately 3900000 we review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate while the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or liquidity in connection with the jv acquisition we entered into an environmental agreement dated december 7 2000 with henkel under which henkel agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the former jv as of december 31 2003 henkel’s earlier outstanding reimbursement obligation to us for such environmental liabilities of 108319 euro or approximately 116000 was paid in addition we have retained responsibility for certain sites where our former chemlawn business is a prp currently there are five such locations and at each chemlawn is a de minimis party anticipated costs currently accrued for these matters were included in our loss from our discontinued chemlawn operations in 1991 the accrual remaining reflects our best estimate of probable future costs 

  

number of employees  we currently have approximately 20800 employees

the company conducts business in approximately 70 countries outside of the united states through whollyowned subsidiaries or in the case of china israel and venezuela through majorityowned joint ventures with local partners in other countries selected products are sold by the company’s export operations to distributors agents or licensees although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of the company’s overall revenues the largest international operations are located in europe asia pacific latin america and canada with smaller operations in africa 

  

in general the businesses conducted internationally are similar to those conducted in the united states although the company customizes its products and services to meet unique local requirements the businesses which are similar to the united states’ institutional and food  beverage businesses are the largest businesses in international operations they are conducted in virtually all international locations and compared to the united states constitute a larger portion of the overall business kay also has sales in a number of international locations a significant portion of its international sales are to international units of united statesbased quickservice restaurant chains consequently a substantial portion of kay’s international sales are made either to domestic or internationallylocated thirdparty distributors who serve these chains the company expanded its pest elimination business to the united kingdom and the republic of ireland by acquiring a londonbased provider of commercial pest elimination services in september 2002 in addition the company entered the hospital hygiene market in the united kingdom by acquiring a supplier of hospital hygiene products in december 2002 the company’s other businesses are conducted less extensively in international locations however in general all of the businesses conducted in the united states are operated in canada 

  

 

international businesses are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws tax laws currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions abroad the profitability of international operations has historically been lower than the profitability of businesses in the united states this has been due to the smaller scale of international operations where several operating locations are smaller in size as well as the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions 

  

additional information
