 item 1a risk factors 

as a global energy company chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

business and operational risk factors 

impacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the covid19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on chevron’s financial and operating results the economic business and oil and gas industry impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have been and continue to be far reaching while the oil and gas industry witnessed a substantial recovery of commodity prices and demand for products during 2021 there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results and for what duration and magnitude depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve are difficult to predict and in many instances are beyond the companys control such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic including any further resurgences of the covid19 virus and its variants and the impact on our workforce and operations the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products the ability of our affiliates suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the actions of opec and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and correspondingly commodity prices the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides and chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products 

the company’s suppliers continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic and access to materials supplies and contract labor has been strained this strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put pressure on the company’s financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance incountry conditions including potential future waves of the covid19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity 

in light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in addition the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight 

in addition the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this form 10k which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and profitability including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control including without limitation due to the covid19 pandemic competing fuel prices geopolitical risks the pace of energy transition and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in new business lines such as the lower carbon businesses associated with our chevron new energies 

organization in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including risks from hurricanes severe storms floods heat waves other forms of severe weather wildfires ambient temperature increases sea level rise war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the covid19 pandemic some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actors whether internal or external to chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology it systems and data including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through without limitation malicious software data privacy breaches by employees insiders or others with authorized access cyber or phishingattacks ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems and other electronic security breaches although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty it systems including the cloud additionally authorized thirdparty it systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to chevrons it systems that can materially impact the company’s business regardless of the precise method or form cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance 

mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident series of events or unforeseen liability for which the company is selfinsured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

legal regulatory and esgrelated risk factors 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action for example liability or delays could result from an accidental unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note 16 litigation  

political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing political regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses to force contract renegotiations or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations trade currency exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries further chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the united states and other jurisdictions where we operate which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results in certain countries in addition litigation or changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose chevron to additional tax liabilities  changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company’s control chevron’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations furthermore chevron’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world there is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that chevron has reflected on the company’s tax returns in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition

legislation regulation and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change could continue to increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products resulting in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation regulation or other government actions relating to ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane and climate change international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce ghg emissions are in various stages of implementation the company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions such as the us renewable fuel standard program the european union emissions trading system and the california capandtrade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations further the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to meet their paris agreement goals globally multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as a carbon tax a capandtrade program or performance standards or to indirectly advance reduction of ghg emissions through restrictive permitting trade tariffs minimum renewable usage requirements increased ghg reporting and climaterelated disclosure requirements or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy fuel sources or lowercarbon technologies ghg emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products indirect regulation of ghg emissions could include among other things bans or restrictions on technologies or products that use the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these actions as well as customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products and actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations are beyond the company’s control  

similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment ghg emissions and climate changerelated legislation regulation or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector or render the extraction of the company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible in particular ghg emissionsrelated legislation regulations and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing ghg emissions may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources impact or limit our business plans and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues margins and reputation the ultimate effect of international agreements national regional and state legislation and regulation and government and private actions related to ghg emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the ghg emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissions and climate changerelated agreements legislation regulation and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes including the actual laws and regulations enacted the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes and market conditions 

increasing attention to environmental social and governance esg matters may impact our business  increasing attention to esg matters including those related to climate change and sustainability increasing societal investor and legislative pressure on companies to address esg matters and potential customer use of substitutes to chevron’s products may result in increased costs reduced demand for our products reduced profits increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets and damage to our reputation increasing attention to climate change for example may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation or threats thereof against the company for instance we have received investigative requests and demands from the us congress for information relating to climate change methane leak 

detection and repair and other topics and further requests andor demands are possible at this time chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any congressional or other investigations may have on the company 

in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters including climate change and climaterelated risks such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions also some stakeholders including but not limited to sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves unfavorable esg ratings and investment community divestment initiatives among other actions may lead to negative investor sentiment toward chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital additionally evolving expectations on various esg matters including biodiversity waste and water may increase costs require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment 

our aspirations targets and disclosures related to esg matters expose us to numerous risks including risks to our reputation and stock price in october 2021 chevron announced an aspiration to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050 the company also has set nearerterm ghg emissionrelated targets for zero routine flaring upstream carbon intensity portfolio carbon intensity and refining carbon intensity these aspirations targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational regulatory reputational financial legal and other risks any of which could have a material negative impact including on our reputation and stock price 

our ability to achieve any aspiration target or objective including with respect to climaterelated initiatives our new lower carbon strategy outlined in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pages 32 through 34 and any lower carbon new energy businesses is subject to numerous risks many of which are outside of our control examples of such risks include 1 the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low or noncarbonbased energy sources 2 the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities 3 the availability of costeffective verifiable carbon credits 4 the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards 5 evolving regulatory requirements affecting esg standards or disclosures 6 evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals 7 customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products and 8 actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations 

the standards for tracking and reporting on esg matters are relatively new have not been harmonized and continue to evolve our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period in addition our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying measuring and reporting esg metrics our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals 

achievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations and targets such as the foregoing and future internal climaterelated initiatives may increase costs require purchase of carbon credits or limit or impact the company’s business plans and financial results potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic endoflife of certain assets an impairment of the associated net book value among other material adverse impacts our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations and targets or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce or at all could have a negative impact on investor sentiment ratings outcomes for evaluating the company’s approach to esg matters stock price and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation among other material adverse impacts

business environment and outlook 

chevron corporation is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia bangladesh brazil canada china egypt equatorial guinea israel kazakhstan kurdistan region of iraq mexico nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of congo singapore south korea thailand the united kingdom the united states and venezuela 

the company’s objective is to deliver higher returns lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control in the company’s downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or writeoff of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses including employee reductions and capital and exploratory expenditures along with other measures intended to improve financial performance 

governments companies communities and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change recognizing that individuals and society benefit from access to affordable reliable and evercleaner energy international initiatives and national regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce ghg emissions are in various stages of adoption and implementation these policies some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the paris agreement can change the amount of energy consumed the rate of energydemand growth the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another implementation of these policies can be dependent on and can affect the pace of technological advancements the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities the availability of costeffective verifiable carbon credits the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards evolving regulatory requirements affecting esg standards or other disclosures and evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals beyond the legislative and regulatory landscape ever changing customer and consumer behavior can also influence energy demand by affecting preferences and use of the company’s products or competitors’ products now and in the future 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

chevron supports the paris agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the need for energy that supports society chevron integrates climate changerelated issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where it believes they are applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect estimates of longrange effects from climate changerelated policy actions such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon capture and storage is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions as discussed in more detail below the company has announced planned capital spend of 10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments 

although the future is uncertain many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply the company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ demand for energy at the same time chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon the company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy technology and customer preferences chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels hydrogen carbon capture and offsets to grow its lower carbon businesses chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified while leveraging the company’s capabilities assets and customer relationships the company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces among other factors 

in 2021 chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy 

2050 net zero upstream aspiration chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions on an equity basis by 2050 the company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on among other things partnerships with multiple stakeholders continuing progress on commercially viable technology government policy successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and naturebased projects availability of costeffective verifiable offsets in the global market and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities 

2028 upstream production ghg intensity targets these metrics include scope 1 direct emissions and scope 2 indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam the targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a 

• 40 percent reduction in oil production ghg intensity to 24 kilograms kg carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oilequivalent co 2 eboe 

• 26 percent reduction in gas production ghg intensity to 24 kg co 2 eboe 

• 53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg co 2 eboe and 

• 66 percent reduction in flaring ghg intensity to 3 kg co 2 eboe 

the company also targets no routine flaring by 2030 we have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the paris agreement entered into force and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the paris agreement stocktakes we believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its net zero aspiration 

2028 portfolio carbon intensity target the company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity pci metric which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of chevron’s entire business this metric encompasses the company’s upstream and downstream business and includes scope 1 direct emissions scope 2 indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam and certain scope 3 primarily emissions from use of sold products emissions the company’s pci target is 71 grams g carbon dioxide equivalent co e per megajoules mj by 2028 a greater than five percent reduction from 2016 

planned lowercarbon capital spend through 2028 the company increased its planned capital spend to approximately 10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy which includes approximately 2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and approximately 8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets we anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company

progresses toward its 2050 upstream production scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and further grows its lower carbon business lines 

refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 20 through 25 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to chevron’s business including the risks impacting chevron’s lower carbon strategy and its aspirations targets and plans 

response to market conditions and covid19 commodity prices and demand for most of our products have largely recovered from the impacts of covid19 in 2020 however some countries face a resurgence of the virus and its variants eg delta omicron that could impact demand for some of our products eg jet fuel workforce availability timing of project startups and materials movement and pose a risk to our business and future financial results 

chevron’s operations have continued with a combination of onsite and athome work while monitoring local vaccine and transmission rates in refining the company continued to take steps to maximize diesel and motor gasoline production given the decline in jet fuel demand 

in tco progress continued on fgpwpmp staffing is at targeted levels and at the end of december 2021 over 90 percent of the tco workforce onsite was fully vaccinated 

the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is mainly due to mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 17 taxes provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years 

refer to the “cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information” on page 2 and to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods 

the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning 

comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows 

upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by opec countries actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the covid19 pandemic and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses 

the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts the pace of energy transition and changes in tax environmental and other applicable laws and regulations 

the company is actively managing its schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals third party costs for capital exploration and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including but not limited to severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction global and local supply chain distribution issues the general level of inflation tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

prices for goods and services in various sectors have risen over the past year a key factor behind this trend is the accelerated demand for goods and transportation as companies restock materials and expand working inventories as a hedge against future disruptions shifts in the labor market continue to create issues for companies seeking to fill positions geographic mismatches between skills required and available labor reductions in the overall labor supply and perceptions of working conditions have resulted in tight labor markets 

as us and international drilling activity continues to accelerate continued upward market pressure is expected for oil and gas industry inputs such as rigs and well services the pace of economic growth and shifting spending patterns may lead to more crossindustry competition for resources which could impact the cost of certain nonoil and gas industry goods and services 

the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 71 per barrel for the fullyear 2021 compared to 42 in 2020 as of midfebruary 2022 the brent price was 100 per barrel the wti price averaged 68 per barrel for the fullyear 2021 compared to 39 in 2020 as of midfebruary 2022 the wti price was 95 per barrel the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark 

crude prices increased in 2021 driven by production curtailment by opec countries and steadily increasing demand for transportation fuels the company’s average realization for us crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was 56 per barrel up 84 percent from 2020 the company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was 65 per barrel up 79 percent from 2020 

prices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supplyanddemand and infrastructure conditions in local markets in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 385 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2021 compared with 198 per mcf during 2020 as of midfebruary 2022 the henry hub spot price was 393 per mcf 

outside the united states prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances the company’s longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with some sold in the asian spot lng market international natural gas realizations averaged 593 per mcf during 2021 compared with 459 per mcf during 2020 see page 42 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions 

the company’s worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2021 was a record 3099 million barrels per day about 27 percent of the company’s net oilequivalent production in 2021 occurred in opec member countries of angola equatorial guinea kazakhstan nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait and republic of congo 

the company estimates that its net oilequivalent production in 2022 will be flat to down 3 percent compared to 2021 assuming a brent crude oil price of 60 per barrel and excluding the impact of asset sales that may close in 2022 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction reservoir performance greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shutin production or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production the company has increased its investment emphasis on shortcycle projects 

in january 2022 chevron announced its intent to begin the process of exiting from its nonoperated interests in myanmar at december 31 2021 the carrying value of the company’s assets was approximately 200 million

downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives petrochemicals and renewable fuels industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events 

other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the company’s shipping operations which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax environmental and other applicable laws and regulations

financial ratios and metrics 

the following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time 

current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities which indicates the company’s ability to repay its shortterm liabilities with shortterm assets the current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a lastin firstout basis at yearend 2021 the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs based on average acquisition costs during the year by approximately 56 billion 



interest coverage ratio income before income tax expense plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests divided by beforetax interest costs this ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt the company’s interest coverage ratio in 2021 was higher than 2020 due to higher income

financial and derivative instrument market risk

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase sale and storage of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes the results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2021 

the company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies the company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent thirdparty quotes the change in fair value of chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2021 was not material to the company’s results of operations 

the company uses the monte carlo simulation method as its valueatrisk var model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value at the 95 percent confidence level with a oneday holding period from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued based on these inputs the var for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at december 31 2021 and 2020 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations 

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments the foreign currency derivative contracts if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income there were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2021

the company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of longlived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated these asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues the liability balance of approximately 128 billion for asset retirement obligations at yearend 2021 is related primarily to upstream properties 

for the company’s other ongoing operating assets such as refineries and chemicals facilities no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various international federal state and local environmental health and safety laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices in addition legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position 

accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards 

using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2021 at approximately 19 billion for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 03 billion of environmental capital expenditures and 16 billion of costs associated 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the decommissioning and restoration of sites 

for 2022 total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 05 billion these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

the discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the sec wherein 

1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 

2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material 

the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed “critical” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows 

oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development production and carbon costs 

the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevron’s consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following 

1 amortization  capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unitofproduction uop basis using proved developed reserves acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves during 2021 chevron’s uop depreciation depletion and amortization dda for oil and gas properties was 137 billion and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2021 were 69 billion barrels for consolidated companies if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties uop dda in 2021 would have increased by approximately 700 million 

2 impairment  oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review proved reserves and in some cases a portion of unproved resources are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments see impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates below 

refer to table v  “reserve quantity information” for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended december 31 2021 and to table vii  “changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves” for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2021 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 

impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 

determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices operating expenses carbon costs production profiles the pace of the energy transition and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 18 properties plant and equipment and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  

the company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets’ associated carrying values 

investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s ppe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets 

asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 25 asset retirement obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans note 23 employee benefit plans includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptions 

the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included in note 23 employee benefit plans under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control 

for 2021 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 65 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 30 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 19 percent for the primary us pension plan the actual return for 2021 was 112 percent for the 10 years ended december 31 2021 actual asset returns averaged 98 percent for this plan additionally with the exception of two years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 65 percent during each year 

total pension expense for 2021 was 12 billion an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately 81 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2021 by approximately 357 million 

the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2021 was a net liability of approximately 34 billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2021 the company used a discount rate of 28 percent to measure the obligations for the primary us pension plan as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 425 million and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately 12 billion to 800 million 

for the company’s opeb plans expense for 2021 was 85 million and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2021 was 25 billion for the primary us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 29 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 16 percent to measure expense in 2021 and a 28 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2021 discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2021 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2021 

differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page 88 in note 23 employee benefit plans for more information on the 51 billion of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2021 in addition information related to company contributions is included on page 91 in note 23 employee benefit plans under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as “operating expenses” or “selling general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 24 other contingencies and commitments under the heading income taxes  refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2021 

an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss for further information refer to “changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material

summary of significant accounting policies 

general the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method 

investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial performance and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values 

noncontrolling interests ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the consolidated balance sheet the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of equity included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest 

fair value measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market 

derivatives the majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the company’s commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet 

inventories crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market “materials supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

properties plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 21 accounting for suspended exploratory wells for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs 

longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “depreciation depletion and amortization” expense 

longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 9 fair value measurements relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 25 asset retirement obligations relating to aros 

depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties except mineral interests are expensed using the unitofproduction method generally by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unitofproduction method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed 

the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives in general the decliningbalance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states the straightline method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease rightofuse assets 

gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from sales as “other income” 

expenditures for maintenance including those for planned major maintenance projects repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized 

leases leases are classified as operating or finance leases both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated rightofuse assets the company has elected the shortterm lease exception and therefore only recognizes rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year the company has elected the practical expedient to not separate nonlease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant nonlease ie service components 

where leases are used in joint ventures the company recognizes 100 percent of the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease in most cases where the company is the operator of a joint venture lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share the lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract taking into account renewal and termination options that management is

reasonably certain to exercise the company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available 

goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at december 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized 

liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated for crude oil natural gas and mineralproducing properties a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations refer to note 25 asset retirement obligations for a discussion of the company’s aros 

for us federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies future amounts are not discounted recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured 

currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates for those operations all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income the cumulative translation effects for those few entities both consolidated and affiliated using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in “currency translation adjustment” on the consolidated statement of equity 

revenue recognition the company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery the company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost not a separate performance obligation and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized 

revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer the company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing marketbased prices and may include discounts and allowances until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome 

discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends when deliveries contain multiple products an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product the company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods 

stock options and other sharebased compensation the company issues stock options and other sharebased compensation to certain employees for equity awards such as stock options total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards such as stock appreciation rights total compensation cost is based on the settlement value the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement the company’s longterm incentive plan ltip awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights which have graded vesting provisions by which onethird of each award vests on each of the first second and third anniversaries of the date of grant in addition performance shares granted under the company’s ltip will vest at the end of the three year performance period for awards granted under the company’s ltip beginning in 2017 stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each january 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on january 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria the company amortizes these awards on a straightline basis

fair value measurements 

the tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

marketable securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets the fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at december 31 2021 

derivatives the company records most of its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale – on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the offsetting amount to the consolidated statement of income the company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that if applicable are reflected in the table below derivatives classified as level 1 include futures swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york mercantile exchange derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies the fair values of which are obtained from thirdparty broker quotes industry pricing services and exchanges the company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the level 2 instruments since this pricing information is generated from observable market data it has historically been very consistent the company does not materially adjust this information 

properties plant and equipment the company did not have any individually material impairments in 2021 the company reported impairments for certain upstream properties in 2020 primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook 

investments and advances in 2021 the company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 2020 the company fully impaired its investments in petropiar and petroboscan in venezuela the impact of these impairments is included in “income loss from equity affiliates” on the consolidated statement of income

litigation 

ecuador 

texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of an oil production consortium with ecuadorian stateowned petroecuador from 1967 until 1992 after termination of the consortium and a thirdparty environmental audit ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying texpet’s remediation obligations following texpet’s completion of a three year remediation program ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability in may 2003 plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued chevron in the superior court in lago agrio ecuador in february 2011 that court entered a judgment against chevron for approximately  9500 plus additional punitive damages an appellate panel affirmed and ecuador’s national court of justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages resulting in a judgment of approximately  9500  ecuador’s highest constitutional court rejected chevron’s final appeal in july 2018 

in february 2011 chevron sued the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the us district court for the southern district of new york sdny for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act and state law the sdny court ruled that the ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud bribery and corruption and prohibited the rico defendants from seeking to enforce the ecuadorian judgment in the united states or profiting from their illegal acts the court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed and the us supreme court denied certiorari in june 2017 rendering final the us judgment in favor of chevron the lago agrio plaintiffs sought to have the ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in canada brazil and argentina all of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in chevron’s favor chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim against ecuador in september 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty in august 2018 the tribunal issued an award holding that the ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that ecuador had settled and released and that it was procured through fraud bribery and corruption according to the tribunal the ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other states” the tribunal ordered ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the ecuadorian judgment and to compensate chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment the third and final phase of the arbitration to determine the amount of compensation ecuador owes to chevron is ongoing in september 2020 the district court of the hague denied ecuador’s request to set aside the tribunal’s award stating that it now is “common ground” between ecuador and chevron that the ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in december 2020 ecuador appealed the district court’s decision to the hague court of appeals in a

separate proceeding ecuador also admitted that the ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the office of the united states trade representative in july 2020 management continues to believe that the ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced 

climate change 

governmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the united states have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies including chevron entities purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in 21 separate lawsuits brought by 17 us cities and counties two us states the district of columbia and a trade group one of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits and one of the county lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff the lawsuits assert various causes of action including public nuisance private nuisance failure to warn design defect product defect trespass negligence impairment of public trust and violations of consumer protection statutes based upon the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products the unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability both compensatory and punitive injunctive and other forms of equitable relief including without limitation abatement and disgorgement of profits civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits that while we believe remote could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings 

louisiana 

seven coastal parishes and the state of louisiana have filed lawsuits in louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within louisiana’s coastal zone under louisiana’s state and local coastal resources management act slcrma chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases the lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations plaintiffs’ slcrma theories are unprecedented thus there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings

taxes 

 

the reconciliation between the us statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 



1 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions 

2 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in valuation allowances 2021   624  2020   0  2019   0  

the 2021 increase in income tax expense of  7842 is a result of the yearoveryear increase in total income before income tax expense which is primarily due to higher upstream realizations the absence of 2020 impairment and writeoffs and higher downstream margins the company’s effective tax rate changed from 254 percent in 2020 to 275 percent in 2021 the change in effective tax rate is mainly due to mix effects resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions 

the company records its deferred taxes on a taxjurisdiction basis the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following 

 

deferred tax liabilities decreased by  946 from yearend 2020 the decrease to investments and other was driven by a consolidated subsidiary restructuring partially offset with an increase to properties plant and equipment deferred tax assets decreased by  2780 from yearend 2020 this decrease was primarily related to decreases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations and employee benefits partially offset by the increase in foreign tax credits 

the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for us foreign tax credit carryforwards tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are in management’s assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2021 the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately  10750 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  993  primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date others expire at various times from 2022 through 2040 us foreign tax credit carryforwards of  11718 will expire between 2022 and 2032 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows 



income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for us state and foreign withholding tax purposes 

us state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately  49200 at december 31 2021 this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business it is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 

uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements interest and penalties are not included 



approximately 82 percent of the  5288 of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2021 would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition 

tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the company’s major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2021 for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states – 2013 nigeria – 2007 australia – 2009 kazakhstan – 2012 and saudi arabia – 2015 

the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits

on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “income tax expense” as of december 31 2021 accrual benefit of  76  for anticipated interest and penalty was included on the consolidated balance sheet compared with accrual benefit of  95  as of yearend 2020 income tax expense benefit associated with interest and penalties was  19   124  and  3  in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

shortterm debt 

 

redeemable longterm obligations consist primarily of taxexempt variablerate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date 

the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its shortterm debt at december 31 2021 the company had no interest rate swaps on shortterm debt 

at december 31 2021 the company had  10075 in 364 day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis the credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year this supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor or secured overnight financing rate sofr when libor has permanently or indefinitely ceased or is no longer representative or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2021 

the company classified  7759 and  9825 of shortterm debt as longterm at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year and the company has both the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis

accounting for suspended exploratory wells 

the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired and its costs net of any salvage value would be charged to expense 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended december 31 2021 



 2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the noble acquisition 2019 represents property sales 

the following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling 



 certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both 

of the  2044 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december 31 2021  1119 is related to nine projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future the  925 balance is related to six projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development 

the projects for the  925 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability a  486  four projects – undergoing frontend engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years  b  439  two projects – development alternatives under review while progress was being made on all 15 projects the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity scale and negotiations associated with the projects more than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years  

the  2044 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december 31 2021 represents 83 exploratory wells in 15 projects the tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis

employee benefit plans 

the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages in the united states all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding standard the company does not typically fund us nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives 

the company also sponsors other postretirement benefit opeb plans that provide medical and dental benefits as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees the plans are unfunded and the company and retirees share the costs for the company’s main us medical plan the increase to the premedicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company 

the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet

the funded status of the company’s pension and opeb plans for 2021 and 2020 follows 



amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and opeb plans at december 31 2021 and 2020 include 



for the year ended december 31 2021 the decrease in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial gains caused by higher discount rates used to value the obligations and large benefit payments paid to retirees in 2021 for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations 

amounts recognized on a beforetax basis in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and opeb plans were  4979 and  7278 at the end of 2021 and 2020 respectively these amounts consisted of 



the accumulated benefit obligations for all us and international pension plans were  11337 and  4976  respectively at december 31 2021 and  13608 and  5758  respectively at december 31 2020

the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2021 2020 and 2019 are shown in the table below 



assumptions the following weightedaverage assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended december 31 

 

expected return on plan assets the company’s estimated longterm rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the company’s estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies for 2021 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 650 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets 

the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on highquality bonds the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis were 28 percent 24 percent and 31 percent for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively for both the main us pension and opeb plans 

other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2021 for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 62 percent in 2022 and gradually decline to 45 percent for 2031 and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2020 the assumed health care costtrend rates started with 61 percent in 2021 and gradually declined to 45 percent for 2027 and beyond 

plan assets and investment strategy 

the fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



1 us equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of  0 at december 31 2021 and  4 at december 31 2020 

2 collective trustsmutual funds for us plans are entirely index funds for international plans they are mostly unit trust and index funds 

3 mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixedincome instruments in order to diversify and lower risk 

4 the yearend valuations of the us real estate assets are based on thirdparty appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio 

5 the “other” asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled level 1 dividends and interest and taxrelated receivables level 2 insurance contracts level 3 and investments in privateequity limited partnerships nav 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in level 3 plan assets are outlined below 



the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management 

the company’s us and uk pension plans comprise 94 percent of the total pension assets both the us and uk plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns to assess the plans’ investment performance longterm asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established 

for the primary us pension plan the company’s investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges equities 40 – 65 percent fixed income 20 – 40 percent real estate 0 – 15 percent alternative investments 0 – 5 percent and cash 0 – 25 percent for the uk pension plan the uk board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines equities 10 – 30 percent fixed income 55 – 85 percent real estate 5 – 15 percent and cash 0 – 5 percent the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and illiquidity constraints to mitigate concentration and other risks assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds 

the company does not prefund its opeb obligations 

cash contributions and benefit payments in 2021 the company contributed  1552 and  199 to its us and international pension plans respectively in 2022 the company expects contributions to be approximately  1100 to its us plans and  200 to its international pension plans actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns changes in pension obligations regulatory environments tax law changes and other economic factors additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations 

the company anticipates paying opeb benefits of approximately  150 in 2022  146 was paid in 2021 

the following benefit payments which include estimated future service are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years

guarantees the company has one guarantee to an equity affiliate totaling  215  this guarantee is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate over the approximate 6 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate there are numerous crossindemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee chevron has recorded no liability for this guarantee 

indemnifications in the acquisition of unocal the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997 the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of  200  which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the  200 obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 

although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and takeorpay agreements are 2022 –  1049  2023 –  1106  2024 –  1119  2025 –  1193  2026 –  1223  after 2026 –  7626  the aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are 2022 –  57  2023 –  257  2024 –  242  2025 –  252  2026 –  200  after 2026 –

environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws regulations private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties such contingencies may exist for various operating closed and divested sites including but not limited to us federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws refineries chemical plants marketing facilities crude oil fields and mining sites 

although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

chevron’s environmental reserve as of december 31 2021 was  960  included in this balance was  230 related to remediation activities at approximately 145 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the us federal superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties any future actions by regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity 

of the remaining yearend 2021 environmental reserves balance of  730   466 is related to the company’s us downstream operations  50 to its international downstream operations and  214 to its upstream operations liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates 

aros are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates

chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was  745 million as of december 31 2021 and  671 million as of december 31 2020 with a majority of the allowance relating to nontrade receivable balances 

the majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables with a balance of  164 billion as of december 31 2021 which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base as a result the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring prepayments letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis including probability of default and loss given default which takes into consideration current and forwardlooking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data this statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically shortterm in nature with most due in less than 90 days 

chevron’s nontrade receivable balance was  34 billion as of december 31 2021 which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review this management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts nontrade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk loans to equity affiliates and nonequity investees are also considered nontrade and associated allowances of  560 million are included within “investments and advances” on the consolidated balance sheet at both december 31 2021 and december 30 2020

on october 5 2020 the company acquired noble energy inc an independent oil and gas exploration and production company noble’s principal upstream operations are in the united states the eastern mediterranean and west africa noble’s operations also include an integrated midstream business in the united states the acquisition of noble provides the company with lowcost proved reserves attractive undeveloped resources and cashgenerating assets 

the aggregate purchase price of noble was  4109  with approximately 58 million shares of chevron common stock issued as consideration in the transaction representing approximately 3 percent of shares of chevron common stock outstanding immediately after the acquisition as part of the transaction the company recognized longterm debt and finance leases with a fair value of  9231  

the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under asc 805 which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods up to one year from the acquisition date as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together

reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resources classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by a number of organizations including the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate 

proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the manager of global reserves has more than 30 years of experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of the american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineers 

all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates 

the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve quantities are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the chevron corporation reserves manual  which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves 

during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board 

rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the chevron corporation reserves manual  

technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2021 additions to chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves 

noteworthy changes in proved undeveloped reserves are shown in the table below and discussed on the following page 



in 2021 revisions include an increase of 202 million boe in australia primarily from the approval of the jansz io compression project gorgon and jansz io make up the gorgon project in the united states there was a net increase of 192 million boe primarily from the midland and delaware basins where 105 million boe was attributed to improved commodity price environment and performance revisions and 91 million boe associated with the anchor project in the gulf of mexico due to improved commodity price in bangladesh there was an increase of 30 million boe primarily from

the approval of the bibiyana optimization project and entitlement effects these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 339 million boe in kazakhstan primarily at tco which includes entitlement effects changes in field operating assumptions reservoir model changes and changes to the fgpwpmp schedule 

in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 630 million boe in the united states were primarily due to the increase of activity and planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the midland and delaware basins 

the difference in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 149 million boe between the net quantities of proved reserves of 807 million boe as reflected on pages 105 to 107 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 658 million boe is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2021 

purchases of 36 million boe in 2021 are from the acquisition of various properties in the midland and delaware basins in the united states 

transfers to proved developed reserves in 2021 include 245 million boe in the united states primarily from the midland delaware and dj basin developments and 125 million boe in equatorial guinea canada and other international locations these transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities 

during 2021 investments totaling approximately 66 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 01 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves the united states accounted for about 28 billion related primarily to various development activities in the midland and delaware basins and the gulf of mexico in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 25 billion primarily related to development projects of tco in kazakhstan an additional 04 billion were spent on development activities in australia in africa about 04 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about 05 billion of expenditures 

reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution these factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels 

at yearend 2021 the company held approximately 16 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 400 million boe remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization in africa approximately 200 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria affiliates account for about 950 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million boe that have remained undeveloped for five years or more approximately 800 million boe are related to tco in kazakhstan and about 100 million boe are related to angola lng at tco and angola lng further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints 

annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2021 improvements in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve increases and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 35 percent 

proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2021 the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest

summary description of chevron 

chevron corporation  a delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to us and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for developing producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas processing liquefaction transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines transporting storage and marketing of natural gas and a gastoliquids plant downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products marketing of crude oil refined products and lubricants transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives 

a list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in exhibit 211 on page e1 

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of organization of petroleum exporting countries opec russia and the united states are the major factors in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies invest conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers in the upstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining and marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining manufacturing sale and marketing of fuels lubricants additives and petrochemicals

delivery commitments 

the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities as discussed below 

in the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver 1136 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023 the company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity 

production from the company’s proved developed us reserves and thirdparty purchases these commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms 

outside the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2800 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2021 through 2023 from operations in australia and israel the australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery the israel sales contracts contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation brentlinked or other over the life of the contract and have a contractual floor the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries 

development activities

the following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at december 31 2020 a “development well” is a well drilled within the known area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive 

  

  



  

exploration activities 

refer to table i on page 99 for detail on the company’s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2020 2019 and 2018 

the following table summarizes the company’s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years and the number of exploratory wells drilling at december 31 2020 “exploratory wells” are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unknown areas and include delineation and appraisal wells which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir 



review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas 

chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins chevron’s 2020 key upstream activities some of which are also discussed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page 37 are presented below the comments include references to “total production” and “net production” which are defined under “production” in exhibit 991 on page e7 

the discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant longleadtime projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment 

united states 

upstream activities in the united states are primarily located in texas new mexico california colorado and the gulf of mexico acreage for the united states can be found in the table on page 7 net daily oilequivalent production in the united states can be found in the table on page 6 

with the acquisition of noble in october 2020 chevron increased its position in the permian basin and acquired acreage in colorado and wyoming 

the company’s acreage in the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation the company is also applying data analytics and technology to drive improvements in identifying well targets in drilling and completions and in production performance in 2020 chevron’s net daily unconventional and conventional production in the permian basin averaged 294000 barrels of crude oil 980 million cubic feet of natural gas and 150000 barrels of ngls 

in 2020 chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in california construction was completed in april 2020 on a new 29megawatt solar farm to supply power to the lost hills field in october 2020 chevron announced participation in a carbon capture trial in california with startup expected in 2022

to complement the company’s capabilities chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives including the marine spill response corporation which operates in us territorial waters and oil spill response ltd which operates globally the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico in addition the company is a member of the subsea well response project which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world 

the company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its daytoday operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gasrelated laws and regulations to which it is subject refer to item 1a risk factors on pages 18 through 23 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to chevron’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the company’s control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

business operational and acquisitionrelated risk factors 

impacts of the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for chevron’s products and caused a precipitous drop in commodity prices that has had and may continue to have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on chevron’s financial and operating results 

as of the date of this annual report on form 10k the economic business and oil and gas industry impacts from the covid19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have continued to be far reaching crude oil prices the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations fell to historic lows even briefly going negative due to a combination of a severely reduced demand for crude oil gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel and other refined products resulting from governmentmandated travel restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity resulting from the covid19 pandemic as a result a market imbalance has existed and may continue to exist with oil supplies exceeding current and expected nearterm demand although opec members and other countries have agreed to cut global oil supply the commitments and actions to date have not matched the significant decrease in global demand which has resulted in increased inventory levels in refineries pipelines and storage facilities in prior periods and which may drive increased inventory levels in future periods 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs may be negatively affected as would its production volumes and proved reserves as a result the value of the company’s assets may also become impaired in future periods as we saw in 2020 

the company’s operations and workforce are being impacted by the covid19 pandemic causing certain operations to be curtailed to various degrees at 50 percentowned tengizchevroil in kazakhstan covid19 infections have led to the demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the fgpwpmp project although infection levels in kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020 allowing remobilization of the fgpwpmp construction workforce to commence a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020 slowing progress on the project the ultimate effects of covid19 on fgpwpmp construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time in particular we are currently unable to predict whether covid19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete fgpwpmp on schedule or within the current cost estimate for the project 

as a result of decreased demand for its products the company made cuts to its upstream capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2020 which are expected to negatively impact future production have led to and could lead to further negative revisions of reserves and could also lead to the further impairment of assets production curtailments such as those due to the reductions imposed by opec nations in kazakhstan nigeria and angola and other production curtailment actions taken by operators of assets for which the company has nonoperated interests or due to market conditions have exacerbated and may continue to further exacerbate these negative impacts in future periods within downstream the company reduced its capital spending program and is also deferring certain discretionary maintenance activities while maintaining expenditures for asset integrity and reliability the company has reduced the utilization rates of its refineries in response to reduced demand for its products particularly greatly reduced demand for jet fuel due to the covid19 impact on travel and the aviation industry 

the company’s suppliers are also being impacted by the covid19 pandemic and access to materials supplies and contract labor has been strained in certain cases the company has received notices invoking force majeure provisions in supplier contracts this strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put further pressure on the company’s financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance incountry conditions including potential future waves of the covid19 virus in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity 

in light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period in addition the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight 

there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results and for what duration and magnitude depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve are difficult to predict and in many instances are beyond the companys control such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic including any resurgences of the pandemic and the impact on our workforce and operations the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products the ability of our affiliates suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the actions of opec and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and correspondingly commodity prices the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides and chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic is evolving and the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this form 10k which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and profitability including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude 

oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control including without limitation due to the covid19 pandemic competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including risks from hurricanes severe storms floods heat waves other forms of severe weather wildfires ambient temperature increases sea level rise war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the covid19 pandemic any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actors whether internal or external to chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology it systems and data including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty it 

systems including the cloud additionally authorized thirdparty it systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to chevrons it systems that can materially impact the company’s business regardless of the precise method or form cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is selfinsured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the noble acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations 

the success of the noble acquisition which closed in october 2020 will depend in part on chevron’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition including the anticipated annual runrate operating and other cost synergies and accretion to return on capital employed free cash flow and earnings per share failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe operational challenges the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition may have an adverse impact on our financial results 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership noble midstream partners lp which may involve a potential legal liability 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of noble midstream a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of noble midstream may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to noble midstream including claims of conflict of interest any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal regulatory and esgrelated risk factors 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action for example liability or delays could result from an accidental unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 78 

political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses to force contract renegotiations or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations trade currency exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries further chevron is required to comply with us sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the companys operations in certain countries in addition litigation or changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

legislation regulation and other government actions related to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change could continue to increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products chevron may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic legislation regulation or other government actions relating to ghg emissions and climate change like any significant changes in the regulatory environment ghg and climate changerelated legislation and regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the international energy agency’s iea world energy outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond if new legislation regulation or other government action contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition 

international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their paris agreement goals in some jurisdictions the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the us renewable fuel standard program the european union emissions trading system and the california capandtrade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as for example via a carbon tax eg singapore and canada or via a capandtrade program eg mexico and china many governments are providing tax advantages and other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy sources or lowercarbon technologies the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws regulations and other actions making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate 

ghg emissionsrelated legislation regulations and government actions and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products indirect regulation of ghg emissions could include bans or restrictions on technologies that use the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products and substitute products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such legislation and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

consideration of climate changerelated issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climate changerelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements national regional and state legislation and regulation and government actions related to ghg emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the ghg emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissions and climate changerelated agreements legislation regulation and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes 

increasing attention to environmental social and governance esg matters may impact our business increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes to chevron’s products may result in increased costs reduced demand for our products reduced profits increased investigations and litigation and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets increasing attention to climate change for example may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against the company 

in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions also some stakeholders including but not limited to sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds have been promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves unfavorable esg ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor sentiment toward chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital

key financial results 



refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page 37 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended december 31 2020 

business environment and outlook 

chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia bangladesh brazil canada china egypt equatorial guinea indonesia israel kazakhstan kurdistan region of iraq myanmar mexico nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of congo singapore south korea thailand the united kingdom the united states and venezuela 

the company’s objective is to deliver higher returns lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control in the company’s downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or writeoff of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses including employee reductions and capital and exploratory expenditures along with other measures intended to improve financial performance similarly impairments or writeoffs have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of managerial decisions not to progress certain projects in the company’s portfolio 

with ongoing global interest in addressing the risks of climate change support for policies and advancements in lower carbon technologies is expected in seeking to help advance a lower carbon future chevron is focused on lowering its carbon intensity cost efficiently increasing renewables and offsets in support of its business and investing in lowcarbon technologies to enable commercial solutions 

response to market conditions and covid19 during most of 2020 travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity designed to limit the spread of the covid19 virus were implemented in many locations around the world these constraints reduced demand for our products and commodity prices fell negatively impacting the company’s 2020 financial and operating results while demand and commodity prices have shown signs of recovery demand is not back to prepandemic levels and financial results will likely continue to be challenged in future quarters due to the rapidly

changing environment there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability around the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our future results which could be material 

chevron entered this crisis well positioned with a strong balance sheet flexible capital program and low cash flow breakeven price to protect its longterm health and value the company took swift action adjusting the items it can control the company lowered its capital expenditures 35 percent and lowered its operating expense excluding nonrecurring severance costs by 14 billion compared to 2019 the company completed an enterprisewide transformation that is expected to capture additional cost efficiencies additionally the company suspended its stock repurchase program in march 2020 taken together these actions are consistent with our financial priorities to protect the dividend to prioritize capital spend that drives longterm value and to maintain a strong balance sheet the company expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity and access to both commercial paper and debt capital markets due to its strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings additionally the company has access to nearly 10 billion in committed credit facilities 

the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years 

refer to the “cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information” on page 2 and to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods the company’s asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 targeted beforetax proceeds of 510 billion for the three year period ending december 31 2020 assets sales proceeds totaled 77 billion in the middle of the guidance range 

the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning 

comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows 

upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the covid19 pandemic and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations 

the company is actively managing its schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals third party costs for capital exploration and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including but not limited to the general level of inflation tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends 

the spot markets and some of the current cost indexes for many materials and services have stabilized crude oil and natural gas prices and demand have rebounded from lows of the early pandemic though demand still has not returned to prepandemic levels drilling activity in the us has risen slowly but steadily through the end of the year the timing and 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

trajectory of any increase in the cost of materials and services going forward will depend on the extent of the oil and gas industry recovery correlated with these initial signs of industry recovery and cost stabilization was a noticeable improvement in the risk of default for key suppliers to date there have been no material impacts to operations due to supplier defaults chevron is actively monitoring and engaging key suppliers to mitigate any potential business impacts 

capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction or other factors 

the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 42 per barrel for the fullyear 2020 compared to 64 in 2019 as of midfebruary 2021 the brent price was 64 per barrel the wti price averaged 39 per barrel for the fullyear 2020 compared to 57 in 2019 as of midfebruary 2021 the wti price was 60 per barrel the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark 

crude prices sharply declined at the end of the first and into the second quarter 2020 due to surplus supply as demand decreased following governmentimposed travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity in the second half of 2020 the supplydemand balance slowly improved primarily due to production cuts and demand growth allowing prices to somewhat recover the company’s average realization for us crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was 31 per barrel down 37 percent from 2019 the company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was 36 per barrel down 38 percent from 2019 

prices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supplyanddemand and infrastructure conditions in local markets in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 198 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2020 compared with 253 per mcf during 2019 as of midfebruary 2021 the henry hub spot price increased to 600 per mcf amid freezing temperatures across much of the united states 

outside the united states prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances the company’s longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market international natural gas realizations averaged 459 per mcf during 2020 compared with 583 per mcf during 2019 see page 41 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions 

the company’s worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2020 averaged 3083 million barrels per day about 14 percent of the company’s net oilequivalent production in 2020 occurred in the opecmember countries of angola equatorial guinea nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait republic of congo and venezuela 

the company estimates that net oilequivalent production in 2021 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2020 assuming a brent crude oil price of 50 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2021 asset sales this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction reservoir performance greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds storage constraints or economic 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

conditions that could lead to shutin production or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production the company has increased its investment emphasis on shortcycle projects but these too are under pressure in the current market environment 

in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production was shutin beginning in may 2015 in december 2019 the governments of saudi arabia and kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding to allow production to restart in the partitioned zone in midfebruary 2020 prestartup activities commenced and production resumed in july 2020 the financial effects from the loss of production in 2019 and first half 2020 were not significant during the fourth quarter 2020 oil equivalent production in the partitioned zone averaged 40 thousand barrels per day 

chevron has interests in venezuelan crude oil assets including those operated by petropiar petroboscan and petroindependiente while the operating environment in venezuela has been deteriorating for some time petropiar petroboscan and petroindependiente have conducted activities consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the united states government during the second quarter 2020 the company completed its evaluation of the carrying value of its venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluded that given the current operating environment and overall outlook which created significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the company’s investment an other than temporary loss of value had occurred which resulted in a full impairment of its investment in the country totaling 26 billion and change in accounting treatment from equity method to nonequity method of accounting as a result the company also removed approximately 160 million barrels of proved reserves and stopped reporting production in the country effective july 2020 the company remains committed to its people assets and operations in venezuela 

net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 111 billion barrels of oilequivalent at yearend 2020 a decrease of 3 percent from yearend 2019 the reserve replacement ratio in 2020 was 74 percent the 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 99 percent and 106 percent respectively refer to table v beginning on page 103 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area at the beginning of 2018 and each yearend from 2018 through 2020 and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the threeyear period ending december 31 2020 

response to market conditions and covid19 upstream travel restrictions and other constraints on global economic activity in 2020 in response to covid19 caused a significant decrease in demand for oil and gas this led to lower price realizations across all commodities while critical asset integrity and reliability activities progressed throughout the year

locations with high covid19 infection rates deferred nonessential work and demobilized nonessential personnel to reduce the covid19 exposure risk to our workforce 

despite the challenges posed by the pandemic progress continues on the fgpwpmp project at tengiz in the second quarter the project construction workforce was demobilized to 20 percent of planned levels which slowed the overall construction pace in the third quarter the rate of infections in kazakhstan slowed allowing remobilization of the fgpwpmp construction workforce to begin in the fourth quarter staffing levels at fgpwpmp returned to 95 percent of desired fourth quarter remobilization levels however a worldwide resurgence of infections prevented the remaining 5 percent of the workforce from returning to work and slowed progress on the project extended rotations covid testing and isolation protocols are in place to minimize the spread of the virus given the uncertain timeline for remobilizing all personnel and safely sustaining activity levels it is too early to provide meaningful information regarding impacts on project cost and schedule 

facility maintenance turnarounds are being adjusted and in certain cases deferred into 2021 in some cases turnarounds have been extended in duration andor reduced in scope in response to the pandemic as a result of the reduction in capital expenditures new production is expected to be lower in the near term as drilling and completion activities are scaled back most notably in the permian basin gulf of mexico and argentina exploration activities and projects not yet in execution phase have been deferred which may impact production in future years 

production levels were curtailed in 2020 largely because of reductions imposed by opec nations in kazakhstan nigeria and angola in the fourth quarter opec curtailments eased slightly relative to the third quarter production has also been curtailed due to market conditions most notably in thailand additionally operators of assets where the company has nonoperated interests also curtailed production production curtailments of approximately 106 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day were recorded in 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 we expect curtailments to be approximately 40 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day predominately related to opec restrictions 

decreased capital expenditures lower activity levels delays in future development timing and lower commodity prices have resulted in reductions to chevron’s proved reserve quantities for 2020 for more information on reserves refer to table v beginning on page 103 

as some countries face a resurgence of the virus regulatory and incountry conditions could impact logistics and material movement and pose a risk to business continuity we are taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure to and spread of the covid19 virus through screening testing and when appropriate quarantining workforce and visitors upon arrival to our operated facilities 

refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 37 and 38 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business 

downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events 

other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the company’s shipping operations which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations 

the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states and asia chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas 

response to market conditions and covid19 downstream beginning in march 2020 and continuing into the first quarter 2021 demand for refined products primarily jet fuel and motor gasoline has been below prior year levels as a result of travel restrictions and other constraints on economic activity implemented in many countries to combat the spread of the covid19 virus product prices also fell sharply and although economic activity has somewhat rebounded from lows experienced in april refining margins continued to be at or near historic lows due to lower demand and pressure from 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

a global oil product surplus chevron continued to take steps to maximize diesel production given the decline in jet fuel and motor gasoline demand to fuel transportation that keeps global supply chains moving the company is actively monitoring supply and demand dynamics as every region is experiencing different recovery trends the company is adjusting the schedule for planned maintenance activity across its refining network and idling certain processing units to adjust for lower demand reduce costs manage inventories and most importantly protect the safety of employees and contractors 

as of midfebruary 2021 chevron’s refining crude utilization was approximately 80 to 85 percent and sales were down yearoveryear approximately 50 percent for jet fuel approximately 5 percent for motor gasoline while diesel sales were relatively flat it is unclear how long these conditions will persist but the company will continue to take actions necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of people the environment and its operations as conditions evolve refer to the “results of operations” section on page 38 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations

us upstream 



us upstream reported a loss of 161 billion in 2020 compared with a loss of 509 billion in 2019 the smaller loss was largely due to the absence of fourth quarter 2019 impairment charges of 817 billion primarily associated with appalachia shale and big foot partially offset by lower crude oil realizations of 336 billion and second quarter 2020 impairments and writeoffs of 120 billion 

the company’s average realization for us crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was 3053 per barrel compared with 4854 in 2019 the average natural gas realization was 098 per thousand cubic feet in 2020 compared with 109 in 2019 

net oilequivalent production in 2020 averaged 106 million barrels per day up 14 percent from 2019 production increases from shale and tight properties in the permian basin and 58000 barrels per day of production from the noble acquisition were partially offset by normal field declines 

the net liquids component of oilequivalent production for 2020 averaged 790000 barrels per day up 9 percent from 2019 net natural gas production averaged 161 billion cubic feet per day in 2020 up 31 percent from 2019 

international upstream 



international upstream reported a loss of 825 million in 2020 compared with earnings of 767 billion in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of 46 billion and 12 billion respectively 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

higher charges of 14 billion for impairments and writeoffs charges of 36 billion in 2020 compared to 22 billion in 2019 and lower crude oil sales volumes of 11 billion lower gains on asset sales of 730 million also contributed to the decrease and were largely offset by lower operating expenses of 710 million foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of 38 million between periods 

the company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2020 was 3607 per barrel compared with 5814 in 2019 the average natural gas realization was 459 per thousand cubic feet in 2020 compared with 583 in 2019 

international net oilequivalent production was 203 million barrels per day in 2020 down 5 percent from 2019 the decrease was due to production curtailments associated with opec restrictions and market conditions and asset sale related decreases of 94000 barrels per day partially offset by higher production entitlement effects and volumes associated with the noble acquisition 

the net liquids component of international oilequivalent production was 108 million barrels per day in 2020 down 6 percent from 2019 international net natural gas production of 568 billion cubic feet per day in 2020 decreased 4 percent from 2019 

us downstream 



us downstream reported a loss of 571 million in 2020 compared with earnings of 156 billion in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of 108 billion and lower sales volumes of 100 billion lower equity earnings from the 50 percentowned cpchem of 220 million also contributed to the decrease these were partially offset by lower operating expenses of 220 million 

total refined product sales of 100 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 20 percent from 2019 mainly due to lower jet fuel gasoline and diesel demand associated with the covid19 pandemic 

international downstream 



international downstream earned 618 million in 2020 compared with 922 million in 2019 the decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of 160 million primarily resulting from unfavorable inventory effects unfavorable tax items of 110 million also contributed to the decrease partially offsetting the decrease in earnings were lower operating expenses of 130 million foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of 169 million between periods 

total refined product sales of 122 million barrels per day in 2020 were down 8 percent from 2019 mainly due to lower jet fuel demand associated with the covid19 pandemic

sales and other operating revenues decreased in 2020 mainly due to lower refined product crude oil and natural gas prices and lower refined product volumes 



income from equity affiliates decreased in 2020 mainly due to the full impairment of petropiar and petroboscan in venezuela and lower upstreamrelated earnings from tengizchevroil in kazakhstan 

refer to note 13  beginning on page 77 for a discussion of chevron’s investments in affiliated companies 



other income decreased in 2020 mainly due to the absence of the receipt of the 2019 anadarko merger termination fee lower gains on asset sales and unfavorable swings in foreign currency effects 



crude oil and product purchases decreased 296 billion in 2020 primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices and lower refined product and crude oil volumes 



operating selling general and administrative expenses decreased 10 billion in 2020 the decrease is primarily due to lower services and fees expenses for nonoperated upstream properties materials and supplies expense and lower transportation expense partially offset by higher severance costs 



exploration expenses in 2020 increased primarily due to higher charges for well writeoffs 



depreciation depletion and amortization expenses decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower impairments 



taxes other than on income increased in 2020 primarily due to higher regulatory expenses and property taxes partially offset by lower taxes on production payroll tax and sales and use tax 



interest and debt expenses decreased in 2020 mainly due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher debt balances 



other components of net periodic benefit costs increased in 2020 primarily due to higher pension settlement costs 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 



the decrease in income tax expense in 2020 of 458 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of 1299 billion the decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of lower crude oil prices partially offset by lower impairments and project write off charges 

us income before tax decreased from a loss of 548 billion in 2019 to a loss of 570 billion in 2020 this decrease in earnings before tax was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil prices in the us and the absence of the anadarko merger fee partially offset by lower impairment charges and higher production the us tax benefit increased from 117 billion in 2019 to 158 billion in 2020 primarily due to the increase in beforetax loss 

international income before tax decreased from 1102 billion in 2019 to a loss of 175 billion in 2020 this decrease was primarily driven by the effect of lower crude oil and natural gas prices lower production higher impairments and other charges the lower beforetax income primarily drove the 417 billion decrease in international income tax expense from a charge of 386 billion in 2019 to a benefit of 308 million in 2020

total reported expenditures for 2020 were 135 billion including 40 billion for the company’s share of equityaffiliate expenditures which did not require cash outlays by the company the acquisition of noble is not included in the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures for more information on the noble acquisition see page 96 in note 29  in 2019 expenditures were 210 billion including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of 61 billion 

of the 135 billion of expenditures in 2020 81 percent or 109 billion related to upstream activities approximately 85 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2019 international upstream accounted for 53 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2020 and 54 percent in 2019 

the company estimates that 2021 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be 14 billion including 42 billion of spending by affiliates this is in line with 2020 expenditures and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments highlighted by the fgpwpmp project at the tengiz field in kazakhstan and the company’s permian basin position in the upstream business approximately 65 billion is allocated to currently producing assets including about 20 billion for permian unconventional development approximately 35 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway of which about 75 percent is associated with fgpwpmp at the tengiz field in kazakhstan additionally 15 billion is allocated to exploration early stage development projects and midstream activities the company monitors crude oil market conditions and is able to adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate 

worldwide downstream spending in 2021 is estimated to be 21 billion with 12 billion estimated for projects in the united states 

investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2021 are budgeted at 04 billion 

noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of 10 billion at december 31 2020 and 10 billion at december 31 2019 distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled 24 million and 18 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively included within noncontrolling interests for 2020 is 120 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with noble midstream 

pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 87 in note 21  employee benefit plans under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments”

financial ratios and metrics 

the following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time 

current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities which indicates the company’s ability to repay its shortterm liabilities with shortterm assets the current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a lastin firstout basis at yearend 2020 the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs based on average acquisition costs during the year by approximately 27 billion 



interest coverage ratio income before income tax expense plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests divided by beforetax interest costs this ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt the company’s interest coverage ratio in 2020 was lower than 2019 due to lower income 



free cash flow the cash provided by operating activities less cash capital expenditures which represents the cash available to creditors and investors after investing in the business 



debt ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity which indicates the company’s leverage the company’s debt ratio was 252 percent at yearend 2020 compared with 158 percent at yearend 2019 



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

net debt ratio total debt less cash and cash equivalents time deposits and marketable securities as a percentage of total debt less cash and cash equivalents time deposits and marketable securities plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity which indicates the company’s leverage net of its cash balances 



capital employed the sum of chevron corporation stockholders’ equity total debt and noncontrolling interests which represents the net investment in the business 



return on average capital employed roce net income attributable to chevron adjusted for aftertax interest expense and noncontrolling interest divided by average capital employed average capital employed is computed by averaging the sum of capital employed at the beginning and end of the year roce is a ratio intended to measure annual earnings as a percentage of historical investments in the business 



return on stockholders ’ equity rose net income attributable to chevron divided by average chevron corporation stockholders’ equity average stockholder’s equity is computed by averaging the sum of stockholder’s equity at the beginning and end of the year rose is a ratio intended to measure earnings as a percentage of shareholder investments

the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations 



1 excludes contributions for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and aro information on employee benefit plans is contained in note 21 beginning on page 87 information on aros is contained in note 23 beginning on page 94 

2 does not include amounts related to the company’s income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions the company is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods in which such liabilities may become payable the company does not expect settlement of such liabilities to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period

financial and derivative instrument market risk 

the market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report including those set forth under the heading “risk factors” in part i item 1a 

derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase sale and storage of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes the results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2020 

the company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies the company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent thirdparty quotes the change in fair value of chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2020 was not material to the company’s results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company uses the monte carlo simulation method as its valueatrisk var model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value at the 95 percent confidence level with a oneday holding period from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued based on these inputs the var for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at december 31 2020 and 2019 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations 

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments the foreign currency derivative contracts if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income there were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2020 

interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income at yearend 2020 the company had no interest rate swaps 

transactions with related parties 

chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties principally its equity affiliates these arrangements include longterm supply or offtake agreements and longterm purchase agreements refer to “other information” on page 77 in note 13  investments and advances for further discussion management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party

environmental the following table displays the annual changes to the company’s beforetax environmental remediation reserves including those for us federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws 



the company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of longlived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated these asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues the liability balance of approximately 136 billion for asset retirement obligations at yearend 2020 related primarily to upstream properties 

for the company’s other ongoing operating assets such as refineries and chemicals facilities no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation 

refer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on chevron and on the company’s 2020 environmental expenditures refer to note 22 on page 93 for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and yearend reserves refer also to note 23 on page 94 for additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various international federal state and local environmental health and safety laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices in addition legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national state and local levels refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 23 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position 

accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards 

using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2020 at approximately 20 billion for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 05 billion of environmental capital expenditures and 15 billion of costs associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the decommissioning and restoration of sites 

for 2021 total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 05 billion these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

the discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

1 the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and 

2 the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material 

the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed “critical” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows 

oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development and production costs 

the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevron’s consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following 

1 amortization  capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unitofproduction uop basis using proved developed reserves acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves during 2020 chevron’s uop depreciation depletion and amortization dda for oil and gas properties was 130 billion and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2020 were 64 billion barrels for consolidated companies if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties uop dda in 2020 would have increased by approximately 700 million 

2 impairment  oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review proved reserves and in some cases a portion of unproved resources are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments see impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates below 

refer to table v “reserve quantity information” beginning on page 103 for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended december 31 2020 and to table vii “changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves” on page 111 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2020 

this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1  beginning on page 64 which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 

impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 

determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 16 on page 82 and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1  “summary of significant accounting policies” beginning on page 64 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets’ associated carrying values 

investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable 

in 2020 the company recorded impairments and writeoffs for certain oil and gas properties primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook in addition the company fully impaired its investments in petropiar and petroboscan after completing an evaluation of the carrying value of its venezuelan investments in line with its accounting policies and concluding that given the current operating environment and overall outlook which create significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the company’s investment an other than temporary loss of value had occurred 

in 2019 the company recorded impairments and writeoffs for certain oil and gas properties following the review and approval of its business plan and capital expenditure program as a result of the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and a downward revision in its longerterm commodity price outlook the company reduced funding to various natural gasrelated upstream opportunities including appalachia shale kitimat lng and other international projects in addition the revised longterm oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of big foot 

a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s ppe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets 

asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2020 is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 23 on page 94 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans note 21  beginning on page 87 includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptions 

the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 89 in note 21 under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for 2020 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 65 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 33 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 26 percent for the primary us pension plan the actual return for 2020 was 94 percent for the 10 years ended december 31 2020 actual asset returns averaged 79 percent for this plan additionally with the exception of three years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 65 percent during each year 

total pension expense for 2020 was 15 billion an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2020 by approximately 88 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2020 by approximately 269 million 

the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2020 was a net liability of approximately 62 billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2020 the company used a discount rate of 24 percent to measure the obligations for the primary us pension plan as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 61 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 475 million and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately 32 billion to 28 billion 

for the company’s opeb plans expense for 2020 was 57 million and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2020 was 27 billion for the primary us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 34 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 27 percent to measure expense in 2020 and a 24 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2020 discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2020 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2020 

differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page 88 in note 21 for more information on the 74 billion of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2020 in addition information related to company contributions is included on page 91 in note 21 under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

business combinations – purchaseprice allocation accounting for business combinations requires the allocation of the company’s purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their respective fair values the company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations determining the fair values of assets acquired generally involves assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of future revenues and expenditures as well as discount rates for additional discussion of purchase price allocations refer to n ote 29 beginning on page 96  

contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as “operating expenses” or “selling general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 22 beginning on page 92 refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2020 

an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss for further information refer to “changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material

summary of significant accounting policies 

general the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method 

investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial performance and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values 

noncontrolling interests ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the consolidated balance sheet the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of equity included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest 

fair value measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market 

derivatives the majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the company’s commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet 

inventories crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market “materials supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value

properties plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 19  beginning on page 85 for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs 

longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “depreciation depletion and amortization” expense 

longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 7  beginning on page 71 relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 23  on page 94 relating to aros 

depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties except mineral interests are expensed using the unitofproduction method generally by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unitofproduction method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed 

the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives in general the decliningbalance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states the straightline method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease rightofuse assets 

gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from sales as “other income” 

expenditures for maintenance including those for planned major maintenance projects repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized 

leases leases are classified as operating or finance leases both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated rightofuse assets the company has elected the shortterm lease exception and therefore only recognizes rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year the company has elected the practical expedient to not separate nonlease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant nonlease ie service components 

where leases are used in joint ventures the company recognizes 100 percent of the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease in most cases where the company is the operator of a joint venture lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share the lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract taking into account renewal and termination options that management is

goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at december 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized 

liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated for crude oil natural gas and mineralproducing properties a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations refer to note 23  on page 94 for a discussion of the company’s aros 

for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies future amounts are not discounted recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured 

currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates for those operations all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income the cumulative translation effects for those few entities both consolidated and affiliated using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in “currency translation adjustment” on the consolidated statement of equity 

revenue recognition the company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery the company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost not a separate performance obligation and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized 

revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer the company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing marketbased prices and may include discounts and allowances until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome 

discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends when deliveries contain multiple products an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product the company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods 

stock options and other sharebased compensation the company issues stock options and other sharebased compensation to certain employees for equity awards such as stock options total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards such as stock appreciation rights total compensation cost is based on the settlement value the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement the company’s longterm incentive plan ltip awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights which have graded vesting provisions by which onethird of each award vests on each of the first second and third anniversaries of the date of grant in addition performance shares granted under the company’s ltip will vest at the end of the three year performance period for awards granted under the company’s ltip beginning in 2017 stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each january 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on january 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria the company amortizes these awards on a straightline basis

ecuador 

texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of an oil production consortium with ecuadorian stateowned petroecuador from 1967 until 1992 after termination of the consortium and a thirdparty environmental audit ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying texpet’s remediation obligations following texpet’s completion of a three year remediation program ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability in may 2003 plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued chevron in the superior court in lago agrio ecuador in february 2011 that court entered a judgment against chevron for approximately  9500 plus additional punitive damages an appellate panel affirmed and ecuador’s national court of justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages resulting in a judgment of approximately  9500  ecuador’s highest constitutional court rejected chevron’s final appeal in july 2018 

in february 2011 chevron sued the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the us district court for the southern district of new york sdny for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act and state law the sdny court ruled that the ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud bribery and corruption and prohibited the rico defendants from seeking to enforce the ecuadorian judgment in the united states or profiting from their illegal acts the court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed and the us supreme court denied certiorari in june 2017 rendering final the us judgment in favor of chevron the lago agrio plaintiffs sought to

have the ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in canada brazil and argentina all of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in chevron’s favor chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim against ecuador in september 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty in august 2018 the tribunal issued an award holding that the ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that ecuador had settled and released and that it was procured through fraud bribery and corruption according to the tribunal the ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other states” the tribunal ordered ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the ecuadorian judgment and to compensate chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment the third and final phase of the arbitration to determine the amount of compensation ecuador owes to chevron is ongoing in september 2020 the district court of the hague denied ecuador’s request to set aside the tribunal’s award stating that it now is “common ground” between ecuador and chevron that the ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in december 2020 ecuador appealed the district court’s decision to the hague court of appeals in a separate proceeding ecuador also admitted that the ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the office of the united states trade representative in july 2020 

management’s assessment the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain chevron continues to believe that the ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and that it does not provide any basis upon which an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or range of loss can be made

taxes 

 

the reconciliation between the us statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table 



 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 

the 2020 decrease in income tax expense of  4583 is a result of the yearoveryear decrease in total income before income tax expense which is primarily due to lower crude oil prices in 2020 partially offset by lower impairment and write off

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

charges the company’s effective tax rate changed from 49 percent in 2019 to 25 percent in 2020 the change in effective tax rate is a consequence of mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions 

the company records its deferred taxes on a taxjurisdiction basis the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following 

 

deferred tax liabilities decreased by  403 from yearend 2019 the decrease to properties plant and equipment temporary differences was partially offset with an increase to investments and other the properties plant and equipment decrease was primarily due to upstream impairments deferred tax assets increased by  3621 from yearend 2019 this increase was primarily related to increases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations miscellaneous items related to foreign exchange and foreign tax credits acquired with the purchase of noble 

the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for us foreign tax credit carryforwards tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are in management’s assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2020 the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately  19763 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  1056  primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date others expire at various times from 2021 through 2034 us foreign tax credit carryforwards of  10585 will expire between 2021 and 2030 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows 



income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for us state and foreign withholding tax purposes 

us state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately  52100 at december 31 2020 this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business it is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested

uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements interest and penalties are not included 



approximately 83 percent of the  5018 of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition 

tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the company’s major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2020 for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states – 2013 nigeria – 2007 australia – 2009 and kazakhstan – 2012 

the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 

on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “income tax expense” as of december 31 2020 accrual benefit of  95  for anticipated interest and penalty were included on the consolidated balance sheet compared with accrual charges of  30 as of yearend 2019 income tax expense benefit associated with interest and penalties was  124   3  and  8 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

shortterm debt 

 

redeemable longterm obligations consist primarily of taxexempt variablerate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date 

the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its shortterm debt at december 31 2020 the company had no interest rate swaps on shortterm debt 

at december 31 2020 the company had  9825 in 364 day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis the credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year this supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2020 

the company classified  9825 and  9750 of shortterm debt as longterm at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year and the company has both the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis

accounting for suspended exploratory wells 

the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired and its costs net of any salvage value would be charged to expense 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended december 31 2020 



 2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the noble acquisition 2019 represents property sales 

the following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling the aging of the former noble wells is based on the date the drilling was completed rather than chevron’s october 2020 acquisition of noble 



 certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both 

of the  2486 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december 31 2020  1197 is related to 7 projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future the  1289 balance is related to 10 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development 

the projects for the  1289 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability a  826  seven projects – undergoing frontend engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years  b  463  three projects – development alternatives under review while progress was being made on all 17 projects the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity scale and negotiations associated with the projects more than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years

awards under the chevron longterm incentive plan ltip may take the form of but are not limited to stock options restricted stock restricted stock units stock appreciation rights performance shares and nonstock grants from april 2004 through may 2023 no more than 260 million shares may be issued under the ltip for awards issued on or after may 29 2013 no more than 50 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient for the major types of awards issued before january 1 2017 the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights for awards issued after january 1 2017 contractual terms vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units five years for standard restricted stock units and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights forfeitures for performance shares restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990 

noble sharebased plans noble plans on the closing of the acquisition of noble in october 2020 outstanding stock options granted under various noble plans were exchanged for fully vested chevron options at a conversion rate of 01191 chevron shares for each noble share these awards retained the same provision as the original noble plans awards issued may be exercised for up to 5 years after termination of employment depending upon the termination type or the original expiration date whichever is earlier other awards issued under the noble plans included restricted stock phantom stock units and performance shares that retained the same provisions as the original noble plans upon termination of employment due to changeincontrol all unvested awards issued under the noble plans including stock options restricted stock phantom stock units and performance shares become vested on the termination date 

fair value and assumptions the fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2020 2019 and 2018 were measured on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions

employee benefit plans 

the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages in the united states all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding standard the company does not typically fund us nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives 

the company also sponsors other postretirement benefit opeb plans that provide medical and dental benefits as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees the plans are unfunded and the company and retirees share the costs for the company’s main us medical plan the increase to the premedicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company 

the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet

the funded status of the company’s pension and opeb plans for 2020 and 2019 follows 



amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and opeb plans at december 31 2020 and 2019 include 



for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations 

amounts recognized on a beforetax basis in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and opeb plans were  7278 and  6357 at the end of 2020 and 2019 respectively these amounts consisted of 



the accumulated benefit obligations for all us and international pension plans were  13608 and  5758  respectively at december 31 2020 and  12781 and  5203  respectively at december 31 2019

the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2020 2019 and 2018 are shown in the table below 



assumptions the following weightedaverage assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended december 31 

 

expected return on plan assets the company’s estimated longterm rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the company’s estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies 

for 2020 the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 650 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 65 percent of the company’s pension plan assets in both 2019 and 2018 the company used a longterm rate of return of 675 percent for these plans 

the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on highquality bonds the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2020 were 24 for the main us pension plan and 24 for the main us opeb plan the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2019 were 31 and 31 percent respectively while in 2018 they were 42 and 43 percent for these plans respectively 

other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2020 for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 61 percent in 2021 and gradually decline to 45 percent for 2027 and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2019 the assumed health care costtrend rates started with 68 percent in 2020 and gradually declined to 45 percent for 2025 and beyond 

plan assets and investment strategy 

the fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



1 us equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of  4 at december 31 2020 and  6 at december 31 2019 

2 collective trustsmutual funds for us plans are entirely index funds for international plans they are mostly unit trust and index funds 

3 mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixedincome instruments in order to diversify and lower risk 

4 the yearend valuations of the us real estate assets are based on thirdparty appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio 

5 the “other” asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled level 1 dividends and interest and taxrelated receivables level 2 insurance contracts level 3 and investments in privateequity limited partnerships nav

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in level 3 plan assets are outlined below 



the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management 

the company’s us and uk pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets both the us and uk plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns to assess the plans’ investment performance longterm asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established 

for the primary us pension plan the company’s investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges equities 40 – 65 percent fixed income 20 – 40 percent real estate 0 – 15 percent alternative investments 0 – 5 percent and cash 0 – 25 percent for the uk pension plan the uk board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines equities 10 – 30 percent fixed income 55 – 85 percent real estate 5 – 15 percent and cash 0 – 5 percent the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and illiquidity constraints to mitigate concentration and other risks assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds 

the company does not prefund its opeb obligations 

cash contributions and benefit payments in 2020 the company contributed  950 and  263 to its us and international pension plans respectively in 2021 the company expects contributions to be approximately  1050 to its us plans and  200 to its international pension plans actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns changes in pension obligations regulatory environments tax law changes and other economic factors additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations 

the company anticipates paying opeb benefits of approximately  153 in 2021  155 was paid in 2020 

the following benefit payments which include estimated future service are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years

benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans at yearend 2020 the trust contained 142 million shares of chevron treasury stock the trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earningspershare purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations 

prior to its acquisition by chevron unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans at december 31 2020 and 2019 trust assets of  36 and  35  respectively were invested primarily in interestearning accounts

guarantees the company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling  391  of this amount  137 is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate over the approximate 1 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate the remaining amount of  254 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate over the approximate 7 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate there are numerous crossindemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee 

indemnifications in the acquisition of unocal the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997 the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of  200  which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the  200 obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 

although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2021 –  1000  2022 –  1200  2023 –  1300  2024 –  1300  2025 –  1400  2026 and after –  8400  a portion of these commitments may

environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws regulations private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances including mtbe by the company or other parties such contingencies may exist for various operating closed and divested sites including but not limited to federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws refineries chemical plants marketing facilities crude oil fields and mining sites 

although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

chevron’s environmental reserve as of december 31 2020 was  1139  included in this balance was  247 related to remediation activities at approximately 145 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties any future actions by regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity 

of the remaining yearend 2020 environmental reserves balance of  892   611 is related to the company’s us downstream operations  47 to its international downstream operations  233 to upstream operations and  1 to other businesses liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both 

the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local regulations no single remediation site at yearend 2020 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity

other contingencies governmental and other entities in california and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies including chevron purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties the unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that while we believe remote could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings 

seven coastal parishes and the state of louisiana have filed 43 separate lawsuits in louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within louisiana’s coastal zone under louisiana’s state and local coastal resources management act slcrma chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases the lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations plaintiffs’ slcrma theories are unprecedented thus there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates

financial instruments  credit losses 

chevron adopted accounting standards update asu 201613  financial instruments  credit losses and its related amendments at the effective date of january 1 2020 the standard replaces the “incurred loss model” and requires an estimate of expected credit losses measured over the contractual life of a financial instrument that considers forecast of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions the cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening retained earnings at january 1 2020 was a reduction of  25  representing a decrease to the net accounts and notes receivable balances shown on the company’s consolidated balance sheet on page 61 chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was  671 as of december 31 2020 and  849 as of december 31 2019 with a majority of the allowance relating to nontrade receivable balances a reduction in the allowance for nontrade receivables of  550 was recorded in the second quarter as an agreement was reached with a government joint venture partner that resulted in the writeoff of the associated receivable balances additionally new allowances of  265 were recorded in the second and third quarters associated with other than trade receivables 

the majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables with a balance of  95 billion as of december 31 2020 which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base as a result the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring prepayments letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis including probability of default and loss given default which takes into consideration current and forwardlooking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data this statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically shortterm in nature with most due in less than 90 days the company continues to monitor credit risk in response to the covid19 pandemic and the significant reduction in crude prices resulting from decreased demand associated with governmentmandated travel restrictions 

chevrons nontrade receivable balance was  33 billion as of december 31 2020 which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review this management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts nontrade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk 

equity affiliate loans are also considered nontrade and during the second quarter 2020 review a  560 allowance was recognized within “investments and advances” on the consolidated balance sheet

summary of net oil and gas reserves 



reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by a number of organizations including the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate 

proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available 

proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

manager of global reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of the american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineers 

all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates 

the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the chevron corporation reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves 

during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board 

rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the chevron corporation reserves manual  

the acquisition of noble was completed on october 5 2020 given the timing of the acquisition chevron has continued to rely on legacy noble reserves staff and processes for reviewing reserves with input and guidance from the chevron reserves advisory committee the processes include internal reviews and an external audit accordingly chevron continued to retain netherland sewell  associates inc nsai a thirdparty petroleum consulting firm that completed an audit of the legacy noble acquisition proved reserves at december 31 2020 representing approximately 15 of chevron’s total reserves based upon their evaluation nsai issued an unqualified audit opinion and this report is attached as exhibit 993 to this annual report on form 10k 

technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2020 additions to chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves 

noteworthy changes in proved undeveloped reserves are shown in the table below and discussed on the following page 



supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

in 2020 revisions include a reduction of 392 million boe in the united states primarily from the midland and delaware basins where 300 million boe was attributed to demotions due to capital reductions commodity price effects and performance revisions and 75 million boe from the gulf of mexico primarily from commodity price effects at anchor in australia there was a net reduction of 269 million boe primarily from demotion of compression volumes related to capital and approval delays at jansz io partially offset by positive revisions at gorgon gorgon and jansz io make up the gorgon project a reduction of 85 million boe was recorded in canada primarily from commodity price effects at kaybob duvernay in nigeria there was a reduction of 67 million boe primarily from gas volume changes based on reduced demand and development plan changes at meren in venezuela there was a demotion of 48 million boe due to impairment and accounting methodology change these negative revisions were partially offset by an increase of 143 million boe in kazakhstan primarily from entitlement effects at tco and karachaganak 

in 2020 extensions and discoveries of 108 million boe in the united states were primarily due to portfolio optimizations where future drilling in various fields is being targeted toward liquidsrich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies in the midland and delaware basins 

the differences in 2020 extensions and discoveries of 124 million boe between the net quantities of proved reserves of 247 million boe as reflected on pages 106 to 109 and net quantities of proved undeveloped of 123 million boe are primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as puds in the prior year but rather were recognized directly as proved developed 

purchases of 329 million boe in 2020 include 326 million boe from the noble acquisition primarily in israel and the dj basin in the united states 

sales of 95 million boe in 2020 include 77 million boe from the sale of the company’s interest in azerbaijan 

transfers to proved developed reserves in 2020 include 178 million boe in the united states primarily from the midland and delaware basin developments and 84 million boe in canada kazakhstan and other international locations these transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities 

during 2020 investments totaling approximately 63 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 01 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 34 billion primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan the united states accounted for about 21 billion related primarily to various development activities in the midland and delaware basins and the gulf of mexico in africa about 03 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about 05 billion of expenditures 

reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels 

at yearend 2020 the company held approximately 16 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 400 million boe remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization in africa approximately 200 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria affiliates account for about 13 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million boe that have remained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints 

annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2020 decreases in commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve decreases and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves

sections over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 38 percent 

proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2020 the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest 

at december 31 2020 proved reserves for the company were 111 billion boe the company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2018 2019 and 2020 are shown in the table on page 107 the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 108 and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 109 

noteworthy changes in crude oil condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2018 through 2020 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page 

revisions in 2018 improved field performance at various gulf of mexico fields and in the midland and delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 121 million barrel increase in the united states improved field performance at various fields including agbami in nigeria and mohobilondo in the republic of congo were responsible for the 61 million barrel increase in africa reserves in other americas increased by 59 million barrels primarily due to improved field performance at the hebron field in canada in asia improved performance across numerous assets resulted in the 37 million barrel increase 

in 2019 portfolio optimizations where future drilling in various fields in the midland and delaware basins is being targeted away from reservoirs with higher gastooil ratios and lower execution efficiencies and planned divestments in the appalachian basin were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrel decrease in the united states operational issues with the petropiar upgrader in venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil and condensate reserves of 105 million barrels reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 75 million barrels increase in the tco affiliate in kazakhstan improved field performance at various fields including mohobilondo in the republic of congo mafumeria in angola and sonam in nigeria were responsible for the 42 million barrel increase in africa 

in 2020 capital reductions and commodity price effects in the midland and delaware basins and anchor in the gulf of mexico were primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the united states reserves in venezuela affiliates decreased by 149 million barrels primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change entitlement effects and performance revisions in the tco affiliate were primarily responsible for the 180 million barrels increase entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 77 million barrels synthetic oil at the athabasca oil sands in canada and 74 million barrels at multiple locations in asia 

extensions and discoveries in 2018 extensions and discoveries in the midland and delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 359 million barrel increase in the united states extensions and discoveries in the duvernay shale in canada and loma campana in argentina were primarily responsible for the 31 million barrel increase in other americas 

in 2019 portfolio optimizations where future drilling in various fields in the midland and delaware basins is being targeted towards liquidsrich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies and extensions and discoveries in the deepwater fields in the gulf of mexico were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrel increase in the united states extensions and discoveries in loma campana in argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrel increase in other americas 

in 2020 extensions and discoveries in the midland and delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million barrels increase in the united states

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec russia and the united states are the major factors in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies invest conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers in the upstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining and marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining manufacturing sale and marketing of fuels lubricants additives and petrochemicals

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the company’s control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the coronavirus any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actors whether internal or external to chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology it systems and data including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty it systems including the cloud additionally authorized thirdparty it systems can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to chevrons it systems during the normal course of business the company has limited control and visibility over such thirdparty it systems cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action the company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action for example liability or delays could result from an accidental unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 72  

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is selfinsured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses to force contract renegotiations or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed 

restrictions on the company’s operations trade currency exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries further chevron is required to comply with us sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the companys operations in certain countries for example with respect to our operations in venezuela as discussed in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements “other contingencies and commitments  other contingencies” future events could result in the environment in venezuela becoming more challenged which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results in addition litigation or changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions has increased and could continue to increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions like any significant changes in the regulatory environment ghg regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the iea’s world energy outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition 

international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their paris agreement goals in some jurisdictions the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the us renewable fuel standard program the european union emissions trading system and the california capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as for example via a carbon tax eg singapore and canada or via a capandtrade program eg california mexico and china the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate 

ghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products and substitute products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or 

existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the ghg emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes

key financial results 



refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page 32 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended december 31 2019  

business environment and outlook 

chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia azerbaijan bangladesh brazil canada china colombia indonesia kazakhstan myanmar mexico nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of congo singapore south korea thailand the united kingdom the united states and venezuela 

earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control in the company’s downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products it is the company’s objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or writeoff of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures along with other measures intended to improve financial performance similarly impairments or writeoffs may occur as a result of managerial decisions not to progress certain projects in the companys portfolio 

the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 15 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years 

refer to the “cautionary statements relevant to forwardlooking information” on page 2 and to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods the company’s

asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting beforetax proceeds of 510 billion proceeds related to asset sales were 20 billion in 2018 and 28 billion in 2019 

the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning 

comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows 

upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations 

the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs and support operational goals price levels for capital exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including but not limited to the general level of inflation tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services and commoditized prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers the spot markets for many services and materials fell as overall industry drilling activity in north america declined in 2019 particularly onshore however as industry activity contracts financial pressure on suppliers has increased which may limit further deescalation andor lead to consolidation across the supplier community impacting costs the international and offshore rig markets are also showing some signs of weaknesses as activity has pulled back however pricing for some products and services remains resilient as many suppliers have reset expectations of higher industry spend and instead are looking to higher pricing and margins on a more limited scope of work chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms so there may be a delay in when the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends 

capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction or other factors 

the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the brent price averaged 64 per barrel for the fullyear 2019  compared to 71 in 2018  brent prices increased through the first half of 2019 due to opec production cuts and us sanctions on iran and venezuela prices then started to decline due to heightened concerns about a slowing macro economy and weakening oil demand growth amid trade tensions between the 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

us and china opec announced additional production cuts in december 2019 leading to a price increase with brent prices at 67 at the end of the year as of midfebruary 2020  the brent price was 57 per barrel having declined more than 10 percent since december 2019 primarily due to concerns about demand erosion following the coronavirus outbreak 

the wti price averaged 57 per barrel for the fullyear 2019  compared to 65 in 2018  wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2019 differentials to brent have ranged between 4 to 10 in 2019 primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraints which have restricted flows of inland crude to export outlets on the gulf coast variability in other factors impacting supply and demand of each benchmark crude also affect price differential as of midfebruary 2020  the wti price was 52 per barrel 

chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain fields in angola and china see page 37 for the company’s average us and international crude oil sales prices 

in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supplyanddemand and infrastructure conditions in local markets in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 253 per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2019  compared with 312 during 2018  as of midfebruary 2020  the henry hub spot price was 184 per mcf increased production in the permian basin has resulted in insufficient gas pipeline and fractionation capacity in the nearterm and oversupply conditions leading to depressed natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in west texas a sizable portion of chevron’s us natural gas production comes from the permian basin resulting in natural gas realizations that are significantly lower than the henry hub price 

outside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many locations in some locations chevron has invested in longterm projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets the company’s longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices international natural gas realizations averaged 583 per mcf during 2019  compared with 629 per mcf during 2018  see page 37 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions 

the company’s worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2019 averaged 3058 million barrels per day about 15 percent of the company’s net oilequivalent production in 2019 occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria republic of congo and venezuela opec quotas had no material effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2019 or 2018  

the company estimates that net oilequivalent production in 2020 will grow up to 3 percent compared to 2019  assuming a brent crude oil price of 60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2020 asset sales this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec tariffs and trade sanctions price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction reservoir performance greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production the company has increased its investment emphasis on shortcycle projects 

in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production was shutin beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits net oilequivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81000 barrels per day during 2015 net oilequivalent production averaged 28000 barrels per day in december 2019 the governments of saudi arabia and kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding to resolve the dispute and allow production to restart in the partitioned zone in midfebruary 2020 prestartup activities commenced the financial effects from the loss of production in 2019 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2020 

chevron has interests in venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates while the operating environment in venezuela has been deteriorating for some time the equity affiliates have continued to operate consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to general licenses issued by the united states government it remains uncertain when the environment in venezuela will stabilize but the company remains committed to its personnel and operations in

net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 114 billion barrels of oilequivalent at yearend 2019  a decrease of 5 percent from yearend 2018  the reserve replacement ratio in 2019 was 44 percent the 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 106 percent and 101 percent respectively refer to table v beginning on page 96 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area at the beginning of 2017 and each yearend from 2017 through 2019  and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the threeyear period ending december 31 2019  

refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 32 through 34 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business 

downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events 

other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the company’s shipping operations which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations 

the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states and asia chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas

us upstream 



us upstream recorded a loss of 509 billion in 2019  compared with earnings of 328 billion in 2018  the decrease in earnings was largely due to 817 billion in 2019 impairment charges primarily associated with appalachia shale and big foot partially offset by the absence of 2018 writeoffs and impairments of 660 million largely due to the tigris project in the gulf of mexico also contributing to the decrease was lower crude oil and natural gas prices of 17 2 billio n higher operating expenses of 260 million and the absence of several 2018 asset sale gains totaling 220 million partially offset by higher crud e oil and natura l gas production of 133 billion

us downstream 



us downstream earned 156 billion in 2019  compared with 210 billion in 2018  the decrease was primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of 300 million lower equity earnings from the 50 percentowned cpchem of 140 million and higher depreciation expense of 100 million following first production at the new hydrogen plant at the richmond refinery 

total refined product sales of 125 million barrels per day in 2019 were up 3 percent from 2018

the decrease in income tax expense in 2019 of 302 billion is due to the decrease in total income before tax for the company of  1504 billion  the decrease in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of the upstream impairment and project writeoff charges along with lower commodity prices partially offset by higher gains on asset sales 

us income before tax decreased from a profit of 473 billion in 2018 to a loss of 548 billion in 2019 this decrease in earnings before tax was primarily driven by the effect of upstream impairments and lower crude oil and natural gas prices

partially offset by the anadarko merger termination fee and higher production the us tax decreased from a tax charge of 724 million in 2018 to a tax benefit of 117 billion in 2019 primarily due to the beforetax loss 

international income before tax decreased from 1584 billion in 2018 to 1102 billion in 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by the effects of upstream project writeoff and impairment charges and lower crude oil and natural gas prices partially offset by gains on asset sales the lower beforetax income primarily drove the 113 billion decrease in international income tax expense from 499 billion in 2018 to 386 billion in 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of cash 

the strength of the company’s balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows 

cash cash equivalents marketable securities and time deposits total balances were 57 billion and 103 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was 273 billion  compared to 306 billion in 2018  primarily due to lower crude oil prices cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately 14 billion in 2019 and 10 billion in 2018  cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of 28 billion in 2019 and 20 billion in 2018  

restricted cash of 12 billion and 11 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively was held in cash and shortterm marketable securities and recorded as “deferred charges and other assets” and “prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the consolidated balance sheet these amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities tax payments funds held in escrow for taxdeferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales 

dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were 90 billion in 2019 and 85 billion in 2018  

debt and finance lease liabilities total debt and finance lease liabilities were 270 billion at december 31 2019  down from 345 billion at yearend 2018  

the 75 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2019 was primarily due to the repayment of longterm notes totaling 50 billion as they matured during 2019 and a reduction in commercial paper the company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year consisting primarily of commercial paper redeemable longterm obligations and the current portion of longterm debt totaled 130 billion at december 31 2019  compared with 156 billion at yearend 2018  of these amounts 975 billion and 99 billion were reclassified to longterm debt at the end of 2019 and 2018  respectively 

at yearend 2019  settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2020  as the company had the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis 

chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in may 2021 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company 



the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc all of these securities are the obligations of or guaranteed by chevron corporation and are rated aa by 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

standard and poor’s corporation and aa2 by moody’s investors service the company’s us commercial paper is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and p1 by moody’s all of these ratings denote highquality investmentgrade securities 

the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations cash that may be generated from asset dispositions the capital program and shareholder distributions based on its highquality debt ratings the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals the company can also modify capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s highquality debt ratings 

committed credit facilities information related to committed credit facilities is included in note 17  shortterm debt on page 78  

common stock repurchase program in january 2019 the company purchased shares for 03 billion under the july 2010 stock repurchase program on february 1 2019 the company announced that the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of 25 billion and no set term limits as of december 31 2019 the company had purchased a total of 311 million shares for 37 billion  resulting in 213 billion remaining under the program authorized in february 2019 the company currently expects to repurchase 5 billion of its common stock in 2020 repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market by block purchases in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company the timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of the company’s shares general market and economic conditions and other factors the stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

capital and exploratory expenditures 

capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2019  2018 and 2017 are as follows 



total expenditures for 2019 were 210 billion  including 61 billion for the company’s share of equityaffiliate expenditures which did not require cash outlays by the company in 2018  expenditures were  201 billion including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of  57 billion 

of the 210 billion of expenditures in 2019  85 percent  or 178 billion  related to upstream activities approximately 88 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2018  international upstream accounted for 54 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2019 and 60 percent in 2018  

the company estimates that 2020 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be 20 billion including 62 billion of spending by affiliates this is in line with 2019 expenditures and reflects a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments highlighted by the company’s permian basin position and additional shale and tight development in other basins approximately 84 percent of the total or 168 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities approximately 11 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets including 4 billion for the permian and 1 billion for other shale and tight rock investments approximately 5 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway including 4 billion associated with the future growth and wellhead pressure management project at the tengiz field in kazakhstan global exploration funding is expected to be about 1 billion remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments the company monitors crude oil market conditions and is able to adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate 

worldwide downstream spending in 2020 is estimated to be 28 billion with 16 billion estimated for projects in the united states 

investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2020 are budgeted at 04 billion 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of 10 billion at december 31 2019 and 11 billion at december 31 2018  distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled 18 million and 91 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included beginning on page 82 in note 21  employee benefit plans under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

financial ratios and metrics 

the following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time 

current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities which indicates the company’s ability to repay its shortterm liabilities with shortterm assets the current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a lastin firstout basis at yearend 2019  the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs based on average acquisition costs during the year by approximately 45 billion  



interest coverage ratio income before income tax expense plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests divided by beforetax interest costs this ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt the company’s interest coverage ratio in 2019 was lower than 2018 due to lower income 



free cash flow the cash provided by operating activities less cash capital expenditures which represents the cash available to creditors and investors after investing in the business 



debt ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity which indicates the company’s leverage the company’s debt ratio was 158 percent at yearend 2019  compared with 182 percent at yearend 2018  



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

net debt ratio total debt less cash and cash equivalents time deposits and marketable securities as a percentage of total debt less cash and cash equivalents time deposits and marketable securities plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity which indicates the company’s leverage net of its cash balances 



capital employed the sum of chevron corporation stockholders’ equity total debt and noncontrolling interests which represents the net investment in the business 



return on average capital employed roce net income attributable to chevron adjusted for aftertax interest expense and noncontrolling interest divided by average capital employed average capital employed is computed by averaging the sum of capital employed at the beginning and end of the year roce is a ratio intended to measure annual earnings as a percentage of historical investments in the business 



return on stockholders ’ equity rose net income attributable to chevron divided by average chevron corporation stockholders’ equity average stockholder’s equity is computed by averaging the sum of stockholder’s equity at the beginning and end of the year rose is a ratio intended to measure earnings as a percentage of shareholder investments

financial and derivative instrument market risk 

the market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report including those set forth under the heading “risk factors” in part i item 1a 

derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase sale and storage of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes the results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2019  

the company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies the company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent thirdparty quotes the change in fair value of chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2019 was not material to the company’s results of operations 

the company uses the monte carlo simulation method as its valueatrisk var model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value at the 95 confidence level with a oneday holding period from the effect of adverse changes in market 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued based on these inputs the var for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at december 31 2019 and 2018 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations 

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments the foreign currency derivative contracts if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income there were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2019  

interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income at yearend 2019  the company had no interest rate swaps 

transactions with related parties 

chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties principally its equity affiliates these arrangements include longterm supply or offtake agreements and longterm purchase agreements refer to “other information” on page 71  in note 13  investments and advances for further discussion management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party

environmental the following table displays the annual changes to the company’s beforetax environmental remediation reserves including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws 



the company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of longlived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated these asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues the liability balance of approximately 128 billion for asset retirement obligations at yearend 2019 related primarily to upstream properties 

for the company’s other ongoing operating assets such as refineries and chemicals facilities no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various international federal state and local environmental health and safety laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices in addition legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national state and local levels refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 21 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position 

accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards 

using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2019 at approximately 20 billion for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 06 billion of environmental capital expenditures and 14 billion of costs associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the decommissioning and restoration of sites 

for 2020  total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 04 billion  these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

the discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 

 the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed “critical” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development and production costs 

the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevron’s consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following 

 refer to table v “reserve quantity information” beginning on page 96  for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended december 31 2019  and to table vii “changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves” on page 103 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2019  

this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 beginning on page 57  which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 

impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 

determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 16 on page 77 and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” beginning on page 57  

the company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

disposed assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets’ associated carrying values 

investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable 

in 2019 the company recorded impairments and writeoffs for certain oil and gas properties following the review and approval of its business plan and capital expenditure program as a result of the company’s disciplined approach to capital allocation and a downward revision in its longerterm commodity price outlook the company will reduce funding to various natural gasrelated upstream opportunities including appalachia shale kitimat lng and other international projects in addition the revised longterm oil price outlook resulted in an impairment of big foot no individually material impairments of ppe or investments were recorded for 2018 or 2017 a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s ppe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets 

asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2019 is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 2 3 on page 89 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans note 21  beginning on page 82  includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptions 

the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 84 in note 21 under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control 

for 2019  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 44 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 37 percent for us pension plans the actual return for 2019 was 183 percent  for the 10 years ended december 31 2019  actual asset returns averaged 81 percent for these plans additionally with the exception of three years within this 10year period actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded 675 percent during each year 

total pension expense for 2019 was 09 billion  an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 59 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2019 by approximately 79 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2019 by approximately 197 million 

the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2019  was a net liability of approximately 52 billion  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2019  the company used a discount rate of 31 percent to measure the obligations for the us pension plans as an indication of the 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 401 million and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately 25 billion to 21 billion 

for the company’s opeb plans expense for 2019 was  101 million  and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2019  was 25 billion  for the main us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 45 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 39 percent to measure expense in 2019  and a 31 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2019  discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2019 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2019  for information on the sensitivity of the health care costtrend rate refer to page 84 in note 21 under the heading “other benefit assumptions” 

differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page 83 in note 21 for a description of the method used to amortize the 65 billion of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2019  and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2020  in addition information related to company contributions is included on page 86 in note 21 under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as “operating expenses” or “selling general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 2 2 beginning on page 87  refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2019  

an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss for further information refer to “changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period” in “risk factors” in part i item 1a on page 21

summary of significant accounting policies 

general the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method 

investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial performance and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values 

noncontrolling interests ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the consolidated balance sheet the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of equity 

fair value measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market 

derivatives the majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the company’s commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet 

inventories crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market “materials supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value 

properties plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 19  beginning on page 79  for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs 

longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “depreciation depletion and amortization” expense 

longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 7  beginning on page 65  relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 2 3  on page 89  relating to aros 

depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties except mineral interests are expensed using the unitofproduction method generally by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unitofproduction method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed 

the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives in general the decliningbalance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states the straightline method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease rightofuse assets 

gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from sales as “other income” 

expenditures for maintenance including those for planned major maintenance projects repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized 

goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at december 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized 

liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated for crude oil natural gas and mineralproducing properties a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations refer to note 2 3  on page 89  for a discussion of the company’s aros 

for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current

regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies future amounts are not discounted recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured 

currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates for those operations all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income the cumulative translation effects for those few entities both consolidated and affiliated using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in “currency translation adjustment” on the consolidated statement of equity 

revenue recognition the company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery the company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost not a separate performance obligation and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized 

revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer the company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing marketbased prices and may include discounts and allowances until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome 

discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends when deliveries contain multiple products an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product the company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods 

excise valueadded and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a net basis in “taxes other than on income” on the consolidated statement of income on page 52  purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another including buysell arrangements are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on the consolidated statement of income 

prior to the adoption of asc 606 on january 1 2018 revenues associated with sales of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemicals products and all other sources were recorded when title passed to the customer net of royalties discounts and allowances as applicable revenues from natural gas production from properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers were generally recognized using the entitlement method excise valueadded and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer were presented on a gross basis on the consolidated statement of income 

stock options and other sharebased compensation the company issues stock options and other sharebased compensation to certain employees for equity awards such as stock options total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards such as stock appreciation rights total compensation cost is based on the settlement value the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement the company’s longterm incentive plan ltip awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights which have graded vesting provisions by which onethird of each award vests on each of the first second and third anniversaries of the date of grant in addition performance shares granted under the company’s ltip will vest at the end of the three year performance period for awards granted under the company’s ltip beginning in 2017 stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each january 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on january 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria the company amortizes these awards on a straightline basis

lease commitments 

chevron implemented the new lease standard at the effective date of january 1 2019 the cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of 2019 retained earnings is de minimis the company elected the option to apply the transition provisions at the adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements by making this election the company has not applied retrospective reporting for the comparable periods the company elected the shortterm lease exception provided for in the standard and therefore only recognizes rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year 

the company elected the package of practical expedients to not reevaluate existing contracts as containing a lease or the lease classification unless it was not previously assessed against the lease criteria in addition the company did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases the company applied the land easement practical expedient the company has elected the practical expedient to not separate nonlease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant nonlease ie service components the company assessed some contracts including those for drill ships drilling rigs and storage tanks not previously assessed against the lease criteria as operating leases under the new standard increasing the lease commitments by approximately  2 billion  

the company enters into leasing arrangements as a lessee any lessor arrangements are not significant leases are classified as operating or finance leases both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated rightofuse assets operating lease arrangements mainly involve drill ships drilling rigs time chartered vessels bareboat charters terminals

exploration and production equipment office buildings and warehouses and land finance leases primarily include facilities and vessels 

chevron uses various assumptions and judgments in preparing the quantitative data and qualitative information that is material to the company’s overall lease population where leases are used in joint ventures the company recognizes 100  of the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease in most cases where the company is the operator of a joint venture lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share the lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract taking into account renewal and termination options that management is reasonably certain to exercise the company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available 

details of the rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases including the balance sheet presentation are as follows 



1 capitalized leased assets of  818 are primarily from the upstream segment with accumulated amortization of  617 at december 31 2018

consolidated balance sheet the effect of netting derivative assets and liabilities 



derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts and notes receivable longterm receivables accounts payable and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations amounts not offset on the consolidated balance sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset” 

concentrations of credit risk the company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents time deposits marketable securities derivative financial instruments and trade receivables the company’s shortterm investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments 

the trade receivable balances reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide as a result the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring prepayments letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers

ecuador 

background chevron is a defendant in civil litigation proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed in the superior court for the province of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly operated the lawsuit alleged harm to the environment from the consortium’s oil production activities and sought monetary damages and other relief texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of the consortium from 1967 until 1992 with stateowned petroecuador as the majority partner since 1992 petroecuador has been the sole owner and operator in the concession area after the termination of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area in 1995 texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador under which texpet agreed to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s minority share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a three year remediation program after certifying that the assigned sites were properly remediated in 1998 ecuador granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

chevron defended itself in the lago agrio lawsuit on the grounds that the claims lacked both legal and factual merit as to matters of law chevron asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction the plaintiffs sought to improperly apply a 1999 law

retroactively the claims were timebarred and the lawsuit was barred by releases signed by the republic of ecuador petroecuador and the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company asserted that the evidence confirmed texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that any remaining environmental impacts reflected petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its own legal obligation to remediate the concession area and petroecuador’s conduct after it assumed control over operations in february 2011 the provincial court rendered a judgment against chevron awarding approximately  8600 in damages plus approximately  900 for the plaintiffs’ representatives and approximately  8600 in additional punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days  which chevron did not do in january 2012 an appellate panel affirmed the judgment and ordered that chevron pay an additional 010  in attorneys’ fees in november 2013 ecuador’s national court of justice ratified the judgment but nullified the  8600 punitive damage assessment resulting in a judgment of  9500  in december 2013 chevron appealed the decision to ecuador’s highest constitutional court which rejected chevron’s appeal in july 2018 no further appeals are available in ecuador 

the lago agrio plaintiffs’ lawyers have sought to enforce the judgment in ecuador and other jurisdictions in may 2012 they filed a recognition and enforcement action against chevron corporation chevron canada limited and another subsidiary which was later dismissed as a party in the superior court of justice in ontario canada in september 2015 the supreme court of canada ruled that the ontario superior court of justice had jurisdiction over chevron corporation and chevron canada limited for purposes of the action in january 2017 the superior court ruled that chevron canada limited and chevron corporation are separate legal entities with separate rights and obligations and dismissed the action against chevron canada limited in may 2018 the court of appeal for ontario upheld the dismissal of chevron canada limited the supreme court of canada denied the plaintiffs’ application for leave to appeal in april 2019 rendering the dismissal of chevron canada limited final in july 2019 by consent of the parties the ontario superior court dismissed the recognition and enforcement action against chevron corporation with prejudice and with costs in favor of chevron in june 2012 the plaintiffs filed a recognition and enforcement action against chevron corporation in the superior court of justice in brasilia brazil in may 2015 the brazilian public prosecutor issued an opinion recommending that the court reject the plaintiffs’ action on grounds including that the lago agrio judgment was procured through fraud and corruption and violated brazilian and international public order in november 2017 the superior court of justice dismissed the plaintiffs’ recognition and enforcement action on jurisdictional grounds and in june 2018 the dismissal became final in brazil in october 2012 the provincial court in ecuador issued an ex parte embargo order purporting to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate chevron subsidiaries in ecuador argentina and colombia in november 2012 at the request of the plaintiffs a court in argentina issued a freeze order against chevron argentina srl and another chevron subsidiary in january 2013 an appellate court upheld the freeze order but in june 2013 the supreme court of argentina revoked the freeze order in its entirety in december 2013 chevron was served with the plaintiffs’ complaint seeking recognition and enforcement of the judgment in argentina i n april 2016 the public prosecutor in argentina issued an opinion recommending rejection of the plaintiffs ’ request to recognize the ecuadorian judgment in argentina in november 2017 the national court first instance dismissed the complaint on jurisdictional grounds and the federal civil court of appeals affirmed the dismissal in july 2018 the plaintiffs’ appeal to the supreme court of argentina remains pending chevron continues to believe the ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable because it is the product of fraud and corruption and contrary to the law and all legitimate scientific evidence chevron cannot predict the timing or outcome of any pending or threatened enforcement action but expects to continue a vigorous defense against any imposition of liability and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions 

in february 2011 chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the us district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters asserting violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act and state law in march 2014 the district court entered a judgment in favor of chevron finding that the ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud bribery and corruption and prohibiting the rico defendants from seeking to enforce the lago agrio judgment in the united states or profiting from their illegal acts in august 2016 the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued a unanimous decision affirming the new york judgment in full in june 2017 the us supreme court denied the rico defendants ’ petition for a writ of certiorari rendering the new york judgment in favor of chevron final 

chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september 2009 against the republic of ecuador before an arbitral tribunal administered by the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law the claim alleged violations of ecuador’s obligations under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty bit and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between ecuador and texpet in january 2012 the tribunal issued its first interim measures award requiring ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and outside of ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal in february 2012 the tribunal issued a second

interim award mandating that ecuador take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended enforcement and recognition proceedings within and outside of ecuador also in february 2012 the tribunal issued a third interim award confirming its jurisdiction to hear chevron and texpet’s claims in february 2013 the tribunal issued its fourth interim award in which it declared that ecuador had violated the first and second interim awards the tribunal divided the merits phase of the arbitration into three phases in september 2013 after the conclusion of phase one the tribunal issued its first partial award finding that the settlement agreements between ecuador and texpet applied to both texpet and chevron and released them from public environmental claims arising from the consortium’s operations but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm in august 2018 the tribunal issued its phase two award again in favor of chevron and texpet the tribunal unanimously held that the lago agrio judgment was procured through fraud bribery and corruption and was based on public claims that ecuador had settled and released according to the tribunal the ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other states” the tribunal found that i ecuador breached its obligations under the settlement agreements releasing texpet and its affiliates from public environmental claims ii ecuador committed a denial of justice under international law and violated the usecuador bit due to the fraud and corruption in the lago agrio litigation and iii texpet satisfied its environmental remediation obligations through the remediation program that ecuador supervised and approved the tribunal ordered ecuador to a take immediate steps to remove the status of enforceability from the ecuadorian judgment b take measures to “wipe out all the consequences” of ecuador’s “internationally wrongful acts in regard to the ecuadorian judgment” and c compensate chevron for any injuries resulting from the ecuadorian judgment the final phase three of the arbitration at which damages for chevron’s injuries will be determined was set for hearing in march 2021 ecuador filed in the district court of the hague a request to set aside the tribunal’s interim awards and its first partial award and in january 2016 that court denied ecuador’s request i n july 2017 the appeals court of the netherlands denied ecuador’s appeal and in april 2019 the supreme court of the netherlands upheld the decision of the appeals court and finally rejected ecuador’s challenges to the tribunal’s interim awards and its first partial award in december 2018 ecuador filed in the district court of the hague a request to set aside the tribunal’s phase two award 

management’s assessment the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment management does not believe the judgment has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss

taxes 



the reconciliation between the us statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the table on the following page 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 



 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 

the 2019 decrease in income tax expense of  3024 is a result of the yearoveryear decrease in total income before income tax expense which is primarily due to the impairment and project writeoff charges in 2019 the company’s effective tax rate changed from 28 percent in 2018 to 49 percent in 2019  the change in effective tax rate is a consequence of mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions including a tax charge related to cash repatriation and the impact of asset sales and corporate rate reductions 

the company records its deferred taxes on a taxjurisdiction basis the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following 



 beginning in 2019 the deferred taxes that are the consequence of asu 201602 are included in the “investments and other” and “operating lease” balances above refer to note 5  “lease commitments” beginning on page 62  

deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2019 decreased by approximately  2500 from yearend 2018  the decrease was primarily related to property plant and equipment temporary differences due to upstream asset impairments deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged from yearend 2018 

the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for us foreign tax credit carryforwards tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are in management’s assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2019  the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately  13419 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  1058  primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date others expire at various times from 2020 through 2034  us foreign tax credit carryforwards of  9840 will expire between 2020 and 2029

at december 31 2019 and 2018  deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows 



income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for us state and foreign withholding tax purposes 

us state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately  52500 at december 31 2019  this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business it is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 

uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent  to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements interest and penalties are not included 



approximately 81 percent of the  4987 of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019  would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition 

tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the company’s major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2019  for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states – 2013  nigeria – 2000  australia – 2009 and kazakhstan – 2012  

the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 

on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “income tax expense” as of december 31 2019  accruals of  30 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet compared with accruals of  33 as of yearend 2018  income tax expense benefit associated with interest and penalties was  3    8 and  161  in 2019  2018 and 2017 respectively

shortterm debt 



redeemable longterm obligations consist primarily of taxexempt variablerate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date 

the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its shortterm debt at december 31 2019  the company had no interest rate swaps on shortterm debt 

at december 31 2019  the company had  9750 in 364day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis the credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year this supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2019  

the company classified  9750 and  9900 of shortterm debt as longterm at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year and the company has both the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis

accounting for suspended exploratory wells 

the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired and its costs net of any salvage value would be charged to expense

 represents property sales 

the following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling 



 certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both 

of the  2827 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december 31 2019   1867 is related to 12 projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future the  960 balance is related to 10 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development 

the projects for the  960 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability a  256  four projects – undergoing frontend engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years  b  704  six projects – development alternatives under review while progress was being made on all 22 projects the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity scale and negotiations associated with the projects more than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years  

the  2827 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december 31 2019  represents 123 exploratory wells in 22 projects the tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis

employee benefit plans 

the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages in the united states all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding standard the company does not typically fund us nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives 

the company also sponsors other postretirement benefit opeb plans that provide medical and dental benefits as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees the plans are unfunded and the company and retirees share the costs for the company’s main us medical plan the increase to the premedicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company 

the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 

the funded status of the company’s pension and opeb plans for 2019 and 2018 follows 



amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and opeb plans at december 31 2019 and 2018  include

amounts recognized on a beforetax basis in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and opeb plans were  6357 and  4448 at the end of 2019 and 2018  respectively these amounts consisted of 



the accumulated benefit obligations for all us and international pension plans were  12781 and  5203  respectively at december 31 2019  and  10514 and  4360  respectively at december 31 2018

net actuarial losses recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2019  for the company’s us pension international pension and opeb plans are being amortized on a straightline basis over approximately 10  12 and 14 years  respectively these amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of plan assets the amount subject to amortization is determined on a planbyplan basis during 2020  the company estimates actuarial losses of  385   46 and  3 will be amortized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for us pension international pension and opeb plans respectively in addition the company estimates an additional  320 will be recognized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2020 related to lumpsum settlement costs from the main us pension plans 

the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs credits recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2019  was approximately 3 and 6 years for us and international pension plans respectively and 8 years for opeb plans during 2020  the company estimates prior service credits costs of  2   10 and

assumptions the following weightedaverage assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended december 31 



expected return on plan assets the company’s estimated longterm rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the company’s estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies 

for 2019  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675 percent for us pension plan assets which account for 68 percent of the company’s pension plan assets in both 2018 and 2017 the company used a longterm rate of return of 675 percent for these plans 

the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense 

discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on highquality bonds the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2019 were 31 percent for the main us pension plan and 31 percent for the main us opeb plan the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2018 were 42 and 43 percent  respectively while in 2017 they were 35 and 36 percent for these plans respectively 

other benefit assumptions assumed health care costtrend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2019  for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 68 percent in 2020 and gradually decline to 45 percent for 2025 and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2018  the assumed health care costtrend rates started with 72 percent in 2019 and gradually declined to 45 percent for 2025 and beyond a 1percentagepoint change in the assumed health care costtrend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans

the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management 

the company’s us and uk pension plans comprise 92 percent of the total pension assets both the us and uk plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns to assess the plans’ investment performance longterm asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established 

for the primary us pension plan the company’s investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges equities 30 – 60 percent  fixed income 20 – 40 percent  real estate 0 – 15 percent  alternative investments 0 – 15 percent and cash 0 – 25 percent  for the uk pension plan the uk board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines equities 10 – 30 percent  fixed income 55 – 85 percent  real estate 5 – 15 percent  and cash 0 – 5 percent  the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and illiquidity constraints to mitigate concentration and other risks assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds 

the company does not prefund its opeb obligations 

cash contributions and benefit payments in 2019  the company contributed  1096 and  266 to its us and international pension plans respectively in 2020  the company expects contributions to be approximately  1250 to its us plans and  250 to its international pension plans actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns changes in pension obligations regulatory environments tax law changes and other economic factors additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations 

the company anticipates paying opeb benefits of approximately  174 in 2020   168 was paid in 2019  

the following benefit payments which include estimated future service are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years

settlement of open tax years as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and in the opinion of management adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination 

guarantees the company has two guarantees to equity affiliates totaling  704  of this amount  412 is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate over the approximate 2 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate the remaining amount of  292 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate over the approximate 8 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate there are numerous crossindemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee 

indemnifications in the acquisition of unocal the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997 the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of  200  which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the  200 obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 

although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2020 –  900  2021 –  1100  2022 –  1100  2023 –  1200  2024 –  1200  2025 and after –  7200  a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners total payments under the agreements were approximately  800 in 2019   1400 in 2018 and  1300 in 2017  

as part of the implementation of asu 201602 the company assessed some contracts previously incorporated into the unconditional purchase obligations disclosure as operating leases in 2019 

environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws regulations private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances including mtbe by the company or other parties such contingencies may exist for various operating closed and divested sites including but not limited to federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws refineries chemical plants marketing facilities crude oil fields and mining sites 

although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates 

aros are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream longlived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation

summary of net oil and gas reserves 



reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by a number of organizations including the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate 

proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available 

proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the manager 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

of global reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of the american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineers 

all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates 

the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the chevron corporation reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves 

during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board 

rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the chevron corporation reserves manual  

technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2019 additions to chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2019 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 40 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe a decrease of 641 million boe from yearend 2018 the decrease was due to 685 million boe in revisions the transfer of 593 million boe to proved developed and 31 million boe in sales partially offset by 635 million boe in extensions and discoveries 26 million boe in acquisitions and 7 million boe in improved recovery a major portion of the reserves revisions are attributed to the company’s decision to reduce planned developments and evaluate strategic alternatives including divestment scenarios for it’s acreage in the appalachian region 

during 2019 investments totaling approximately 105 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 01 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 53 billion primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan the united states accounted for about 33 billion related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midland and delaware basins in africa about 05 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada brazil and argentina were primarily responsible for about 10 billion of expenditures in other americas 

reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels 

at yearend 2019 the company held approximately 21 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 700 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects further field development to convert the remaining proved 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization in africa approximately 300 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria affiliates account for about 12 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million boe that have remained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints 

annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2019 decreases in commodity prices negatively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve decreases and positively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 35 percent and 38 percent 

proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2019  the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest 

at december 31 2019  proved reserves for the company were 114 billion boe the company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2017  2018 and 2019 are shown in the table on page 99  the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 100 and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 101

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec russia and the united states are the major factors in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies invest conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers in the upstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining and marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining manufacturing sale and marketing of fuels lubricants additives and petrochemicals

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects 

for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to chevrons cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actors whether internal or external to chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology it systems and data including the it systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty it systems including the cloud the company has limited control and visibility over such thirdparty it systems cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 70  

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is selfinsured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations trade currency exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries further chevron is required to comply with us sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the companys operations in certain countries in addition litigation or changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products   in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions like any significant changes in the regulatory environment ghg regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the iea’s world energy outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition 

international agreements and national regional and state legislation eg california ab32 sb32 and ab398 and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their paris agreement goals in some jurisdictions the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the us renewable fuel standard program the european union emissions trading system and the california capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as for example via a carbon tax eg singapore and canada or via a capandtrade program eg mexico and china the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate 

ghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of 

crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company 

consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the ghg emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes

key financial results   



refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page 32  for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended december 31 2018  

business environment and outlook 

chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries angola argentina australia azerbaijan bangladesh brazil canada china colombia denmark indonesia kazakhstan myanmar nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippines republic of congo singapore south korea thailand the united kingdom the united states and venezuela 

earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control in the companys downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products it is the companys objective to deliver competitive results and stockholder value in any business environment periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or writeoff of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures along with other measures intended to improve financial performance 

the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 16  provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years 

refer to the cautionary statement relevant to forwardlooking information on page 2 and to risk factors in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 21  for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition 

the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient longterm value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods the companys asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting beforetax proceeds of 510 billion proceeds related to asset sales were 20 billion in 2018 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning 

comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows 

upstream   earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations 

the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs however price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including among other things the general level of inflation tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supplyanddemand conditions for such materials and services modest cost pressures continue in rigrelated services across north america unconventional markets cost pressures have softened in well completion activity particularly in the permian basin but are expected to rise when pipeline takeaway constraints are resolved in late 2019 international and offshore markets are showing indications of increased activity levels with limited cost pressures to date 

capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction or other factors 

the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the brent price averaged 71  per barrel for the fullyear 2018  compared to 54  in 2017  crude oil prices increased throughout the first three quarters of 2018 due to solid demand combined with opec production cuts late in the year continued us shale growth combined with unexpected shortterm waivers from iranian sanctions granted to several countries led to excess supply conditions resulting in a decrease in oil prices in response opec agreed to new production cuts in early december as of midfebruary 2019  the brent price was 64  per barrel 

the wti price averaged 65  per barrel for the fullyear 2018  compared to 51  in 2017  wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2018 differentials to brent have ranged between 3 to 10 in 2018 primarily due to pipeline infrastructure constraints which have restricted flows on the inland crude to export outlets on the gulf coast in addition to variability in

other factors impacting supply and demand of each benchmark crude as of midfebruary 2019  the wti price was 54  per barrel 

chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain fields in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page 37 for the company’s average us and international crude oil sales prices 

in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with supplyanddemand conditions in regional markets fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 312  per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2018  compared with 297  during 2017  as of midfebruary 2019  the henry hub spot price was 261  per mcf 

outside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in many locations in some locations chevron has invested in longterm projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets the companys longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices international natural gas realizations averaged 629 per mcf during 2018  compared with 462 per mcf during 2017  see page 37  for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions 

the company’s worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2018  averaged 2930 million  barrels per day about onesixth of the company’s net oilequivalent production in 2018  occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria republic of congo and venezuela opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2018  or 2017  

the company estimates that net oilequivalent production in 2019  will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2018  assuming a brent crude oil price of 60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2019 asset sales this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction reservoir performance greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production the company has increased its investment emphasis on shortcycle projects 



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production was shutin beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits net oilequivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81000 barrels per day during 2015 net oilequivalent production averaged 28000 barrels per day as of early 2019 production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait the financial effects from the loss of production in 2018 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2019 

chevron has interests in venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates during 2018 net oil equivalent production in venezuela averaged 44000 barrels per day the operating environment in venezuela has been deteriorating for some time in january 2019 the united states government issued sanctions against the venezuelan national oil company petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa which is the company’s partner in the equity affiliates the equity affiliates continue to operate and the company is conducting its business pursuant to general licenses issued coincident with the new sanctions future events could result in the environment in venezuela becoming more challenged which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results 

net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 121  billion barrels of oilequivalent at yearend 2018  an increase of 3 percent from yearend 2017  the reserve replacement ratio in 2018  was 136 percent refer to table v beginning on page 95  for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area at the beginning of 2016  and each yearend from 2016  through 2018  and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the threeyear period ending december 31 2018  

refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 32 through 34  for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business 

downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events 

other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the company’s shipping operations which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets and changes in tax laws and regulations 

the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states and asia chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various international federal state and local environmental health and safety laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements and national regional and state legislation eg california ab32 sb32 and ab398 and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices in addition legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national state and local levels refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 18 through 21  for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity or financial position 

accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards 

using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2018  at approximately 20 billion  for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 05 billion  of environmental capital expenditures and 15 billion  of costs associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites 

for 2019  total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 05 billion  these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

the discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 

 the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed “critical” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevrons estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development and production costs 

the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevrons consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following 

 refer to table v “reserve quantity information” beginning on page 95  for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended december 31 2018  and to table vii “changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves” on page 101  for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2018  

this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 beginning on page 55  which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 

impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 

determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 17  on page 77  and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page 55  

the company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the companys crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets’ associated carrying values 

investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable 

no individually material impairments of ppe or investments were recorded for 2018 or 2017 the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties in brazil and the united states during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s ppe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets 

asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2018  is not practicable given the broad range of the companys longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 2 4  on page 88  for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations

the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 83  in note 22  under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the companys control 

for 2018  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675  percent and a discount rate for service costs of 37  percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 30  percent for us pension plans the actual return for 2018  was negative  for the 10 years ended december 31 2018  actual asset returns averaged 79 percent  for these plans additionally with the exception of three years within this 10year period actual asset returns for these plans equaled or exceeded 675  percent during each year 

total pension expense for 2018  was 11 billion  an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2018  by approximately 83 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2018  by approximately 271 million 

the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2018  was a net liability of approximately 39 billion  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2018  the company used a discount rate of 42  percent to measure the obligations for the us pension plans as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 339 million and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately 18 billion to 14 billion 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

for the company’s opeb plans expense for 2018  was 123 million  and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2018  was 24 billion  for the main us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 38 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 32 percent to measure expense in 2018  and a 43 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2018  discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2018  opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2018  for information on the sensitivity of the health care costtrend rate refer to page 83  in note 22  under the heading “other benefit assumptions” 

differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page 82  in note 22  for a description of the method used to amortize the 46 billion  of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2018  and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2019  in addition information related to company contributions is included on page 85  in note 22  under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

contingent losses  management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as “operating expenses” or “selling general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 2 3  beginning on page 86  refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2018  

an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

summary of significant accounting policies 

general the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method 

investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial performance and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values 

noncontrolling interests ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the consolidated balance sheet the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of equity 

fair value measurements   the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market 

derivatives   the majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the company’s commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet 

shortterm investments all shortterm investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities those investments that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “cash equivalents” bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as “time deposits” the balance of shortterm investments is reported as “marketable securities” and is markedtomarket with any unrealized gains or losses included in “other comprehensive income”

inventories   crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market “materials supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value 

properties plant and equipment   the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 20  beginning on page 79  for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs 

longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “depreciation depletion and amortization” expense 

longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 8  beginning on page 63  relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 2 4  on page 88  relating to aros 

depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties except mineral interests are expensed using the unitofproduction method generally by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unitofproduction method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed 

the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives in general the decliningbalance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states the straightline method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets 

gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from sales as “other income” 

expenditures for maintenance including those for planned major maintenance projects repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred major replacements and renewals are capitalized 

goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at december 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized 

liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated for crude oil natural gas and mineralproducing properties a liability for an aro

is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations refer to note 2 4  on page 88  for a discussion of the company’s aros 

for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies future amounts are not discounted recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured 

currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates for those operations all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income the cumulative translation effects for those few entities both consolidated and affiliated using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in “currency translation adjustment” on the consolidated statement of equity 

revenue recognition the company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery  the company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost not a separate performance obligation and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized 

revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer the company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing marketbased prices and may include discounts and allowances until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome 

discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends when deliveries contain multiple products an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product the company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods 

excise valueadded and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a net basis in taxes other than on income on the consolidated statement of income on page 50  purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another including buysell arrangements are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on the consolidated statement of income 

prior to the adoption of asc 606 on january 1 2018 revenues associated with sales of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemicals products and all other sources were recorded when title passed to the customer net of royalties discounts and allowances as applicable revenues from natural gas production from properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers were generally recognized using the entitlement method excise valueadded and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer were presented on a gross basis on the consolidated statement of income 

stock options and other sharebased compensation   the company issues stock options and other sharebased compensation to certain employees for equity awards such as stock options total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value and for liability awards such as stock appreciation rights total compensation cost is based on the settlement value the company recognizes stockbased compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement the company’s longterm incentive plan ltip awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights which have graded vesting provisions by which onethird of each award vests on each of the first second and third anniversaries of the date of grant in addition performance shares granted under the companys ltip will vest at the end of the three year performance period for awards granted under the companys ltip beginning in 2017 stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each january 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on january 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria the company amortizes these awards on a straightline basis

 on january 1 2018 chevron adopted accounting standards updates asu 201615 and 201618 which require retrospective adjustment of prior periods in the statement of cash flows 

in addition to other requirements asu 201615 specifies new standards for the classification of distributions from equity affiliates in adopting these new standards chevron utilized the cumulative earnings approach to evaluate returns on and returns of investment from equity affiliates for the year ended 2017  and 2016  a total of 166  and 322  respectively was reclassified from “distributions less than income from equity affiliates” to “proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment” 

adoption of asu 201618 requires the inclusion of restricted cash and associated changes in restricted cash in the consolidated statement of cash flows the impact of asu 201618 is captured across several line items in the statement of cash flows including “net decrease increase in operating working capital” “decrease increase in other deferred charges” and “proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment” with associated net changes captured in both “net cash provided by operating activities” and “net cash used for investing activities” the line item “net sales purchases of other shortterm investments” was removed in conjunction with the adoption of asu 201618

income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  in fourth quarter 2018 the company elected to early adopt asu 201802 which permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of us tax reform accordingly chevron reclassified 562  from accumulated other comprehensive losses to retained earnings associated with the reduction of the us statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in accordance with its accounting policy the company releases stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income in the period the underlying activity ceases to exist asu 201802 allowed for the reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of the change in tax rates due to us tax reform to be recorded upon adoption of the asu rather than at the actual date that the underlying activity ceases to exist for additional detail refer to note 2  beginning on page 58  

leases topic 842    in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201602 which became effective for the company january 1 2019 the standard requires that lessees present rightofuse assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the company plans to elect the shortterm lease exception provided for in the standard and therefore will only recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year the company further intends to elect the option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at the adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements the company plans to elect the package of practical expedients to not reevaluate existing lease contracts or lease classifications and therefore will not make changes to those leases already recognized on the consolidated balance sheet under asc 840 until the leases are fully amortized amended or modified in addition the company will not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases the company intends to apply the land easement practical expedient chevron plans to elect the practical expedient to not separate nonlease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant nonlease ie service components in addition to the lease component the company will reclassify some contracts currently not classified as leases as operating leases under the new standard 

the company completed accounting policy and disclosure updates and system implementation necessary to meet the standards requirements the company does not expect the adoption of the asu to have a material impact on finance leases which are currently referred to as capital leases the company estimates that the operating lease rightofuse assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are approximately 4 billion  as of january 1 2019 the company expects the implementation of the standard will have a minimal impact on the consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of cash flows

litigation

ecuador   

background  chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador the provincial court in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a three year remediation program at a cost of 40  after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations

companys rico action   in february 2011 chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers consultants and supporters alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws through the civil lawsuit chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable the trial commenced on october 15 2013 and concluded on november 22 2013 on march 4 2014 the federal district court entered a judgment in favor of chevron prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the lago agrio judgment in the united states and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts the defendants appealed the federal district courts decision and on april 20 2015 the us court of appeals for the second circuit heard oral arguments on august 8 2016 the second circuit issued a unanimous opinion affirming in full the judgment of the federal district court on october 27 2016 the second circuit denied the defendants petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal on march 27 2017 two of the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court on june 19 2017 the united states supreme court denied the defendants petition for a writ of certiorari 

managements assessment  the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment management does not believe the judgment has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss

taxes 



the reconciliation between the us statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table 



 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 

the 2018 increase in income tax charge of 5763  from a benefit of 48  in 2017 to a charge of 5715  in 2018 is a result of the yearoveryear increase in total income before income tax expense which is primarily due to higher crude oil realizations offset by lower gains on asset sales in 2018 compared to 2017 us tax reform resulted in a benefit of 2020  being recognized in 2017 reflecting the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities the company’s effective tax rate changed from 05 percent  in 2017  to 28 percent  in 2018  the change in effective tax rate is a consequence of the mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of us tax reform to both the 2018 and 2017 results 

as noted above us tax reform resulted in the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 the us tax return for 2017 was prepared and filed in 2018 and did not result in any material change to the the provisional amounts that were recognized in 2017 and the amounts are now considered final 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the company records its deferred taxes on a taxjurisdiction basis the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following 



deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2018  increased by approximately 400  from yearend 2017  the increase was primarily related to property plant and equipment temporary differences 

deferred tax assets decreased by approximately 1800  in 2018 the decrease primarily related to lower foreign tax credits and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards 

the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for us foreign tax credit carryforwards tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences it reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are in management’s assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2018  the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately 13731  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately 1198  primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date others expire at various times from 2019  through 2036  us foreign tax credit carryforwards of 10536  will expire between 2019  and 2028  

at december 31 2018  and 2017  deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows 



enactment of us tax reform in 2017 imposed a onetime us federal tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad which did not have a material impact on the company’s financial results the indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for us state and foreign withholding tax purposes 

us state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately 59900  at december 31 2018  this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business it is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 

uncertain income tax positions  the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent  to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements interest and penalties are not included 



approximately 82 percent  of the 5070  of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2018  would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition 

tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the company’s major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2018  for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states – 2013  nigeria – 2000  australia – 2006  and kazakhstan – 2007  

the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 

on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “income tax expense” as of december 31 2018  accruals of 33  for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet compared with accruals of 178  as of yearend 2017  income tax expense benefit associated with interest and penalties was 8  161  and 38  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 



 beginning in 2018 these taxes are netted in taxes other than on income in accordance with asu 201409 refer to note 25 revenue beginning on page 88

accounting for suspended exploratory wells   

the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and b the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired and its costs net of any salvage value would be charged to expense 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended december 31 2018  



 represents property sales 

the following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling 



 certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both 

of the 3361  of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december 31 2018  1585   14  projects is related to projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future the 1776  balance is related to 16  projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development 

the projects for the 1776  referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability a 672   three  projects – undergoing frontend engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years  b 93   one  project – development concept under review by government c 963   eight  projects – development alternatives under review d 48   four  projects – miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended while progress was being made on all 30  projects the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity scale and negotiations associated with the projects more than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years  

the 3361  of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december 31 2018  represents 153  exploratory wells in 30  projects the tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis

employee benefit plans   

the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages in the united states all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa minimum funding standard the company does not typically fund us nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives 

the company also sponsors other postretirement benefit opeb plans that provide medical and dental benefits as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees the plans are unfunded and the company and retirees share the costs for the companys main us medical plan the increase to the premedicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent  each year certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company 

the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 

the funded status of the company’s pension and opeb plans for 2018  and 2017  follows 



amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for the company’s pension and opeb plans at december 31 2018  and 2017  include

amounts recognized on a beforetax basis in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and opeb plans were 4448  and 5286  at the end of 2018  and 2017  respectively these amounts consisted of 



the accumulated benefit obligations for all us and international pension plans were 10514  and 4360  respectively at december 31 2018  and 12194  and 5009  respectively at december 31 2017

the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018  2017  and 2016  are shown in the table below 



net actuarial losses recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2018  for the company’s us pension international pension and opeb plans are being amortized on a straightline basis over approximately 10  12  and 13  years respectively these amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent  of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of plan assets the amount subject to amortization is determined on a planbyplan basis during 2019  the company estimates actuarial losses of 239  19  and 3  will be amortized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for us pension international pension and opeb plans respectively in addition the company estimates an additional 290  will be recognized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2019  related to lumpsum settlement costs from the main us pension plans 

the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs credits recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2018  was approximately 4  and 8  years for us and international pension plans respectively and 8  years for opeb plans during 2019  the company estimates prior service credits costs of 2  12  and

assumptions  the following weightedaverage assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended december 31 



expected return on plan assets  the company’s estimated longterm rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the company’s estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies 

for 2018  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675 percent  for us pension plan assets which account for 67 percent  of the company’s pension plan assets in 2017  the company used a longterm rate of return of 675 percent  for these plans and in 2016  725 percent  

the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three  months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense 

discount rate  the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2018  were 42 percent  for the main us pension plan and 43 percent  for the main us opeb plan the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2017  were 35  and 36 percent  respectively while in 2016  they were 39  and 41 percent  for these plans respectively 

other benefit assumptions  assumed health care costtrend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2018  for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 72 percent  in 2019  and gradually decline to 45 percent  for 2025  and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2017  the assumed health care costtrend rates started with 74 percent  in 2018  and gradually declined to 45 percent  for 2025  and beyond a 1percentagepoint change in the assumed health care costtrend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans

the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management 

the company’s us and uk pension plans comprise 91 percent  of the total pension assets both the us and uk plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns to assess the plans’ investment performance longterm asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established 

for the primary us pension plan the companys investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges equities 30 – 60 percent  fixed income and cash 20 – 65 percent  real estate 0 – 15 percent  and alternative investments 0 – 15 percent  for the uk pension plan the uk board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines equities 25 – 45 percent  fixed income and cash 40 – 75 percent  and real estate 5 – 15 percent  the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and illiquidity constraints to mitigate concentration and other risks assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds 

the company does not prefund its opeb obligations 

cash contributions and benefit payments  in 2018  the company contributed 803  and 232  to its us and international pension plans respectively in 2019  the company expects contributions to be approximately 700  to its us plans and 200  to its international pension plans actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns changes in pension obligations regulatory environments tax law changes and other economic factors additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations 

the company anticipates paying opeb benefits of approximately 175  in 2019  166  was paid in 2018  

the following benefit payments which include estimated future service are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years

indemnifications in the acquisition of unocal the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997 the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of 200  which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the 200  obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 

although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements   the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity drill ships utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2019  – 1300  2020  – 1200  2021  – 1300  2022  – 1000  2023  – 800  2023 and after – 4700  a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners total payments under the agreements were approximately 1400  in 2018  1300  in 2017  and 1300  in 2016

although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of

other contingencies   governmental and other entities in california and other jurisdictions have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies including chevron purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties the unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability and injunctions against the production of all fossil fuels that while we believe remote could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings 

chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers trading partners joint venture partners us federal state and local regulatory bodies governments contractors insurers suppliers and individuals the amounts of these claims individually and in the aggregate may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve and may result in gains or losses in future periods

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates 

aros are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream longlived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s beforetax asset retirement obligations in 2018  2017  and 2016

revenue 

on january 1 2018 chevron adopted asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  and its related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method which did not require the restatement of prior periods the adoption did not result in a material change in the company’s accounting or have a material effect on the company’s financial position including the measurement of revenue the timing of revenue recognition and the recognition of contract assets liabilities and related costs 

the most significant change is the presentation of excise valueadded and similar taxes collected on behalf of third parties which are no longer presented within “sales and other operating revenue” on the consolidated statement of income starting in 2018 these taxes which totaled 7861  in 2018  are now netted in “taxes other than on income” on the consolidated statement of income this change to presentation had no impact on earnings these taxes totaled 7189  and 6905  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the company applied the optional exemption to not report any unfulfilled performance obligations related to contracts that have terms of less than one year the amount of future revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations under longterm contracts with fixed components was insignificant for the year ended december 31 2018  

revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of asc 606 which is not material to this line on the consolidated statement of income purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another including buysell arrangements are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “purchased crude oil and products” on the consolidated statement of income refer to note 13  beginning on page 66  for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue

summary of net oil and gas reserves   



     

reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the company classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate 

proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available 

proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the manager of global reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of the american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineers 

all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates 

the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the chevron corporation reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves 

during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board 

rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the  chevron corporation reserves manual   

technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2018 additions to chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2018 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 46 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe an increase of 317 million boe from yearend 2017 the increase was due to 717 million boe in extensions and discoveries 69 million boe in acquisitions 58 million boe in revisions and 6 million boe in improved recovery partially offset by the transfer of 531 million boe to proved developed and 2 million boe in sales a major portion of this reserve increase is attributed to the companys activities in the midland and delaware basins 

during 2018 investments totaling approximately 10 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 01 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 48 billion primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan the united states accounted for about 34 billion related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midland and delaware basins in africa about 07 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada and argentina were primarily responsible for about 09 billion of expenditures in other americas 

reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels 

at yearend 2018 the company held approximately 21 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 600 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects the company completed construction of liquefaction and other facilities to develop this natural gas further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to

occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization in africa approximately 300 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria   affiliates account for about 12 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million boe that have remained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints   

annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2018 increases in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve increases and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections for 2018 this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 38 percent 

proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2018  the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest 

at december 31 2018  proved reserves for the company were 121 billion boe the company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil condensate natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2016  2017  and 2018  are shown in the table on page 98  the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 99

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec russia and the united states are the major factors in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain refer to note 27  beginning on page 89  for a summary of the companys research and development expenses 

environmental protection   the company designs operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through sitespecific risk and impact assessments chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response including postincident remediation 

to complement the company’s capabilities chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives including the marine spill response corporation which operates in us territorial waters and oil spill response ltd which operates globally the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico in addition the company is a member of the subsea well response project which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world 

the company is committed to improving energy efficiency in its daytoday operations and is required to comply with the greenhouse gasrelated laws and regulations to which it is subject refer to item 1a risk factors on pages 19 through 22  for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to chevron’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other 

forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance these cyber threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology it systems and data including the it systems of cloud providers and third parties with which the company conducts business although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty it systems including the cloud the company has limited control and visibility over such thirdparty it systems cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see note 1 7  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 71  

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries further chevron is required to comply with us sanctions laws and regulations which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the companys operations in certain countries in addition changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products   in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions like any significant changes in the regulatory environment ghg regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the iea’s world energy outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition 

international agreements and national regional and state legislation eg california ab32 sb32 and ab398 and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are studying and adopting policies to meet their paris agreement goals in some jurisdictions the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the us renewable fuel standard program the european union emissions trading system and the california capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate ghg emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as for example via a carbon tax eg singapore and canada or via a capandtrade program eg mexico and china the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate 

ghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against the company 

consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or 

existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property plant and equipment estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since midyear 2014 the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted the companys results of operations cash flows leverage capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook a sustained lower price environment could result in the impairment or writeoff of specific assets in future periods the company has responded with reductions in operating expenses pacing and refocusing of capital and exploratory expenditures and increased asset sales the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance however the timing of any such increase is unknown in the companys downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products it is the companys objective to deliver competitive results and shareholder value in any business environment 

the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions as a result a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods note 1 8  provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years

the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets the level of worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning 

comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows 

upstream   earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control including product demand connected with global economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec or other producers actions of regulators weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses the longerterm trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations 

the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work contracting procurement and supplychain activities to effectively manage costs however price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including among other things the general level of inflation commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supplyanddemand conditions for such materials and services industry cost inflation in most onshore segments including north america unconventionals started to modestly rise in 2017 with increases in commodity prices and higher levels of activity and investment offshore costs continue to decline driven by lower offshore activity levels and increased competition among suppliers capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest delays in construction or other factors 

the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and us henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged 54  per barrel for the fullyear 2017  compared to 44  in 2016  as of midfebruary 2018  the brent price was 62 per barrel the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark crude oil prices were better supported in 2017 amid firming demand rising geopolitical tensions and ongoing output reductions by opec and certain nonopec producers however upside was limited as rebounding us and other nonopec production resulted in ongoing oversupplied conditions prices weakened gradually over the first half of 2017 due to concerns that opec cuts would be allowed to expire in june 2017 but firmed over the 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

second half of 2017 after opec’s decision on may 25 2017 to extend cuts through the first quarter of 2018 price support was reinforced on november 30 2017 when opec and their nonopec partners agreed to further extend output cuts through december 2018 

the wti price averaged 51  per barrel for the fullyear 2017  compared to 43  in 2016  as of midfebruary 2018  the wti price was 59 per barrel wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2017 after starting 2017 at a 2 discount to brent the wti discount expanded to about 6 by yearend due to rising us crude production rebounding inventories and growing concerns that pipeline infrastructure constraints would again restrict flows to export outlets on the gulf coast 

a differential in crude oil prices exists between highgravity lowsulfur crudes and lowgravity highsulfur crudes the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supplydemand balances for each crude type in secondhalf 2017 the differential held generally steady in north america as robust refinery demand supported heavy crude values while light sweet crude prices in the us were supported by rising exports of domestic production outside of north america differentials were steady to modestly wider amid wellsupplied light sweet crude markets in the atlantic basin while rising us exports to asia increased competitive pressure on middle east exports to the region chevron has producing interests in heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain fields in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page 39  for the company’s average us and international crude oil realizations 

in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supplyanddemand conditions in those markets fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america in the united states prices at henry hub averaged 297  per thousand cubic feet mcf during 2017  compared with 246  during 2016  as of midfebruary 2018  the henry hub spot price was 257 per mcf 

outside the united states price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstances chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations in some locations chevron has invested in longterm projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets the companys longterm contract prices for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil prices most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding longterm contracts with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices international natural gas realizations averaged 462 per mcf during 2017  compared with 402 per mcf during 2016  see page 39  for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the us and international regions 

the company’s worldwide net oilequivalent production in 2017  averaged 2728 million  barrels per day about onesixth of the company’s net oilequivalent production in 2017  occurred in the opecmember countries of angola nigeria and venezuela opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production in 2017  or 2016  

the company estimates that net oilequivalent production in 2018  will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2017  assuming a brent crude oil price of 60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2018 asset sales this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in construction startup or rampup of projects fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production

in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production was shutin beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits net oilequivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81000 barrels per day during 2015 net oilequivalent production averaged 28000 barrels per day as of early 2018 production remains shut in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait the financial effects from the loss of production in 2017 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2018 

net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 117  billion barrels of oilequivalent at yearend 2017  an increase of 5 percent from yearend 2016  the reserve replacement ratio in 2017  was 155 percent refer to table v beginning on page 95  for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area at the beginning of 2015  and each yearend from 2015  through 2017  and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the threeyear period ending december 31 2017

downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricants fuel oil fuel and lubricant additives and petrochemicals industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supplyanddemand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks and natural gas industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels geopolitical events costs of materials and services refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather fires or other operational events 

other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tankercharter rates for the company’s shipping operations which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining marketing and petrochemical assets 

the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states asia and southern africa chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas

liquidity and capital resources   

sources and uses of cash   

 cash flow from operations increased 77 billion in 2017 primarily due to higher crude oil prices the company also continued to reduce cash outlays and increase asset sales progress on these actions during 2017 included 

 the strength of the company’s balance sheet enabled it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities   total balances were 48 billion  and 70 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively cash provided by operating activities in 2017  was 205 billion  compared with 128 billion  in 2016  and 195 billion  in 2015  reflecting higher crude oil prices cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately 10 billion  in 2017  and 09 billion  in both 2016  and 2015  cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of 52 billion  in 2017  28 billion  in 2016  and 57 billion  in 2015  

restricted cash of 11 billion  and 14 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively was held in cash and shortterm marketable securities and recorded as “deferred charges and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheet these amounts are generally associated with upstream abandonment activities tax payments funds held in escrow for taxdeferred exchanges and refundable deposits related to pending asset sales 

dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were 81  billion in 2017  80  billion in 2016  and 80 billion in 2015  

debt and capital lease obligations   total debt and capital lease obligations were 388  billion at december 31 2017  down from 461 billion at yearend 2016  

the 73  billion decrease  in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2017  was primarily due to a decrease in shortterm obligations reflecting higher crude oil prices the company completed a bond issuance of 40 billion in first quarter 2017 and repaid longterm notes totaling 62 billion that matured in february november and december 2017 the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year consisting primarily of commercial paper redeemable longterm obligations and the current portion of longterm debt totaled 152 billion at december 31 2017  compared with 198 billion at yearend 2016  of these amounts 100 billion and 90 billion were reclassified to longterm debt at the end of 2017 and 2016 respectively 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 at yearend 2017  settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2018  as the company had the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis 

chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in august 2018 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company 



the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc all of these securities are the obligations of or guaranteed by chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa2 by moody’s investors service the company’s us commercial paper is rated a1 by standard and poor’s and p1 by moody’s all of these ratings denote highquality investmentgrade securities 

the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions based on its highquality debt ratings the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s highquality debt ratings 

committed credit facilities  information related to committed credit facilities is included in note 19  shortterm debt on page 78  

common stock repurchase program  in july 2010 the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits the company did not acquire any shares under the program in 2017  or 2016  from the inception of the program through 2014 the company had purchased 1809  million shares for 200 billion 

capital and exploratory expenditures   

capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2017  2016  and 2015  are as follows 



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

total expenditures for 2017  were 188 billion  including 47 billion  for the company’s share of equityaffiliate expenditures which did not require cash outlays by the company in 2016  and 2015  expenditures were  224 billion and  340 billion respectively including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of  38 billion and  34 billion respectively 

of the 188 billion  of expenditures in 2017  87 percent  or 164 billion  related to upstream activities approximately 90 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2016  and 92 percent  in 2015  international upstream accounted for 69  percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2017  77 percent in 2016  and 76 percent  in 2015  

the company estimates that 2018  capital and exploratory expenditures will be 183 billion including 55 billion of spending by affiliates this planned reduction compared to 2017  expenditures reflects project completions improved efficiencies and investment highgrading including the full funding of the companys advantaged permian basin position approximately 86 percent of the total or 158 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities approximately 87 billion of planned upstream capital spending relates to base producing assets including 33 billion for the permian and 10 billion for other shale and tight rock investments approximately 55 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway including 37 billion associated with the future growth and wellhead pressure management project at the tengiz field in kazakhstan global exploration funding is expected to be about 11 billion remaining upstream spend is budgeted for early stage projects supporting potential future developments the company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions and expects to further restrict capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate 

worldwide downstream spending in 2018  is estimated to be 22 billion with 14 billion estimated for projects in the united states 

investments in technology companies and other corporate businesses in 2018  are budgeted at 03 billion 

noncontrolling interests  the company had noncontrolling interests of 12 billion  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled 78 million  and 63 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

pension obligations   information related to pension plan contributions is included on page 82  in note 2 3  employee benefit plans under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

financial ratios   

current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities which indicates the company’s ability to repay its shortterm liabilities with shortterm assets the current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a lastin firstout basis at yearend 2017  the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs based on average acquisition costs during the year by approximately 39 billion  

interest coverage ratio   income before income tax expense plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests divided by beforetax interest costs this ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt the company’s interest coverage ratio in 2017  was higher than 2016  and 2015  due to higher income 

debt ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders equity which indicates the company’s leverage the companys debt ratio was 207 percent at yearend 2017  compared with 241 percent and 202 percent at yearend 2016  and 2015  respectively 

offbalancesheet arrangements contractual obligations guarantees and other contingencies   

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements   the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity drilling rigs utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2018  – 14 billion  2019  – 14 billion  

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2020  – 10 billion  2021  – 09 billion  2022  – 05 billion 2023  and after – 26 billion  a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners total payments under the agreements were approximately 13 billion  in 2017  13 billion  in 2016  and 19 billion  in 2015  

the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations 



 

direct guarantees 



the company has two guarantees of equity affiliates totaling 108 billion  of this amount 712 million  is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate over the approximate 4 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate the remaining amount of 370 million  is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate over the approximate 10 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate there are numerous crossindemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee 

indemnifications   information related to indemnifications is included on page 88  in note 2 5  other contingencies and commitments under the heading “indemnifications” 

financial and derivative instrument market risk   

the market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report including those set forth under the heading “risk factors” in part i item 1a of the company’s 2017  annual report on form 10k 

derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase sale and storage of crude oil refined products natural gas natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes the results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2017  

the company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies the companys risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent thirdparty quotes the change in fair value of chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2017  was not material to the companys results of operations 

the company uses the monte carlo simulation method as its valueatrisk var model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value at the 95 confidence level with a oneday holding period from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued based on these inputs the var for the companys primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at december 31 2017  and 2016  was not material to the companys cash flows or results of operations 

foreign currency   the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments the foreign currency derivative contracts if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income there were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at december 31 2017  

interest rates   the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income at yearend 2017  the company had no interest rate swaps 

transactions with related parties   

chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties principally its equity affiliates these arrangements include longterm supply or offtake agreements and longterm purchase agreements refer to “other information” on page 71  in note 1 6  investments and advances for further discussion management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party

environmental   the following table displays the annual changes to the company’s beforetax environmental remediation reserves including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws 



the company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of longlived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated these asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues the liability balance of approximately 142 billion  for asset retirement obligations at yearend 2017  related primarily to upstream properties 

for the company’s other ongoing operating assets such as refineries and chemicals facilities no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation

environmental matters 

the company is subject to various international federal state and local environmental health and safety laws regulations and marketbased programs these laws regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells for example international agreements and national regional and state legislation eg california ab32 sb32 and ab398 and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions are currently in various stages of implementation consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices in addition legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national state and local levels refer to “risk factors” in part i item 1a on pages 19 through 22  for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business however it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent control reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials or comply with new environmental laws or regulations although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity or financial position 

accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at thirdpartyowned waste disposal sites used by the company an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at nonchevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards 

using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2017  at approximately 20 billion  for its consolidated companies included in these expenditures were approximately 05 billion  of environmental capital expenditures and 15 billion  of costs associated with the prevention control abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating closed or divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites 

for 2018  total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at 05 billion  these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 

the discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission sec wherein 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions including those deemed “critical” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors the areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows 

oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variables impacting chevrons estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance available technology commodity prices and development and production costs 

the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevrons consolidated financial statements using the successful efforts method of accounting include the following 

 refer to table v “reserve quantity information” beginning on page 95  for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended december 31 2017  and to table vii “changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves” on page 101  for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31 2017  

this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties plant and equipment section of note 1 beginning on page 57  which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 

impairment of properties plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties plant and equipment ppe for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value 

determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supplyanddemand conditions for crude oil natural gas commodity chemicals and refined products however the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and longterm investment decisions refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties plant and equipment in note 24  on page 87  and to the section on properties plant and equipment in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page 57  

the company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any writedown in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

gas reserves are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly a significant downward revision in the companys crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets in addition impairments could occur due to changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of assets that are not impaired on a heldandused basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets that is the assets would be impaired if they are classified as heldforsale and the estimated proceeds from the sale less costs to sell are less than the assets’ associated carrying values 

investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value when this occurs a determination must be made as to whether this loss is otherthantemporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment a sensitivity analysis is not practicable 

no individually material impairments of ppe or investments were recorded for the year 2017 the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2016 due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil prices the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties during 2015 primarily as a result of downward revisions in the companys longerterm crude oil price outlook the impairments for the years 2016 and 2015 were primarily in brazil and the united states a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable given the broad range of the company’s ppe and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets 

asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company uses various assumptions and judgments including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation estimated amounts and timing of settlements discount and inflation rates and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2017  is not practicable given the broad range of the companys longlived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates that is favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect refer to note 2 6  on page 89  for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans   note 2 3  beginning on page 82  includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumptions 

the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care costtrend rates information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included on page 84  in note 2 3  under the relevant headings actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial markets 

for 2017  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675  percent and a discount rate for service costs of 42  percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 30  percent for us pension plans the actual return for 2017  was 157 percent  for the 10 years ending december 31 2017  actual asset returns averaged 52 percent  for the plan additionally with the exception of three years within this 10year period actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 675  percent during each year 

total pension expense for 2017  was 12 billion  an increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the longterm rate of return assumption a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 61 percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2017   

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

by approximately 79 million a 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2017  by approximately 305 million 

the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31 2017  was a net liability of approximately 44 billion  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of a plan at december 31 2017  the company used a discount rate of 35  percent to measure the obligations for the us pension plans as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption a 025 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary us pension plan which accounted for about 62 percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately 478 million and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately 20 billion to 15 billion 

for the company’s opeb plans expense for 2017  was 94 million  and the total liability all unfunded at the end of 2017  was 28 billion  for the main us opeb plan the company used a discount rate for service cost of 46 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 34 percent to measure expense in 2017  and a 36 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31 2017  discount rate changes similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis resulted in an immaterial impact on 2017  opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2017  for information on the sensitivity of the health care costtrend rate refer to page 84  in note 2 3  under the heading “other benefit assumptions” 

differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gainloss refer to page 84  in note 2 3  for a description of the method used to amortize the 55 billion  of beforetax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31 2017  and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2018  in addition information related to company contributions is included on page 86  in note 2 3  under the heading “cash contributions and benefit payments” 

contingent losses  management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims litigation tax matters and environmental remediation actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons for example the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages similarly liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws regulations and their interpretation the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 

under the accounting rules a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable the company generally reports these losses as “operating expenses” or “selling general and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statement of income an exception to this handling is for income tax matters for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” ie likelihood greater than 50 percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties refer to note 2 5  beginning on page 87  refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december 31 2017  

an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

summary of significant accounting policies 

general the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well as amounts included in the notes thereto including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities although the company uses its best estimates and judgments actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur 

subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percentowned and any variableinterest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method as part of that accounting the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity currently in income 

investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline the investee’s financial performance and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 

differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference when appropriate the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values 

fair value measurements   the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market 

derivatives   the majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions for some of this derivative activity generally limited to large discrete or infrequently occurring transactions the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting for other similar derivative instruments generally because of the shortterm nature of the contracts or their limited use the company does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income for the company’s commodity trading activity gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixedrate debt if any may be accounted for as fair value hedges interest rate swaps related to floatingrate debt if any are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet 

shortterm investments all shortterm investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities those investments that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “cash equivalents” bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days are reported as “time deposits” the balance of shortterm investments is reported as “marketable securities” and is markedtomarket with any unrealized gains or losses included in “other comprehensive income” 

inventories   crude oil petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost using a lastin firstout method in the aggregate these costs are below market “materials supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at net realizable value 

properties plant and equipment   the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities all costs for development wells related plant and equipment proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas

properties and related asset retirement obligation aro assets are capitalized costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed refer to note 2 1  beginning on page 80  for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs 

longlived assets to be held and used including proved crude oil and natural gas properties are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted future net cash flows events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include writedowns of proved reserves based on field performance significant decreases in the market value of an asset including changes to the commodity price forecast significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset and a morelikelythannot expectation that a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values generally their discounted future net cash flows for proved crude oil and natural gas properties the company performs impairment reviews on a country concession psc development area or field basis as appropriate in downstream impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery a plant a marketinglubricants area or distribution area as appropriate impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “depreciation depletion and amortization” expense 

longlived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value refer to note 10  beginning on page 64  relating to fair value measurements the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a longlived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated refer also to note 2 6  on page 89  relating to aros

ecuador   

background  chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a three year remediation program at a cost of 40  after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations 

lago agrio judgment   in 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 18900  which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineer’s report also asserted that an additional 8400  could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment in 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome the judge presiding over the case was recused in 2010 chevron moved to strike the mining engineer’s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer’s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct in august 2010 the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer’s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days  chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement 

in september 2010 chevron submitted its position on damages asserting that no amount should be assessed against it the plaintiffs’ submission which relied in part on the mining engineer’s report took the position that damages are between approximately 16000  and 76000  and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately 5000  and 38000  the next day the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevron’s prior recusal petition and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved in october 2010 chevron’s motion to recuse the judge was granted a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge’s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case on december 17 2010 the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment 

on february 14 2011 the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case the court rejected chevron’s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion the judgment assessed approximately 8600  in damages and approximately 900  as an award for the plaintiffs’ representatives it also assessed an additional amount of approximately 8600  in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days  of the judgment which chevron did not do on february 17 2011 the plaintiffs appealed the judgment seeking increased damages and on march 11 2011 chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified on january 3 2012 an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the february 14 2011 decision and ordered that chevron pay additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of “ 010  of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment” the plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on january 6 2012 and the court issued a ruling in response on january 13 2012 purporting to clarify and amplify its january 3 2012 ruling which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately 8600  in punitive damages was within 15 days  of the clarification ruling or february 3 2012 chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial on january 20 2012 chevron appealed called a petition for cassation the appellate panel’s decision to ecuador’s national court of justice as part of the appeal chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal on february 17 2012 the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted chevron’s cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the national court of justice to hear the appeal the provincial court appellate panel denied chevron’s request for suspension of the requirement that chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the first and second interim awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below on march 29 2012 the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the national court of justice and on november 22 2012 the national court agreed to hear chevrons cassation appeal on august 3 2012 the provincial court in lago agrio approved a courtappointed liquidator’s report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be 19100  on november 13 2013 the national court ratified the judgment but nullified the 8600  punitive damage assessment resulting in a judgment of 9500  on december 23 2013 chevron appealed the decision to the ecuador constitutional court ecuadors highest court the reporting justice of the constitutional court heard oral arguments on the appeal on july 16 2015

the tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases on september 17 2013 the tribunal issued its first partial award from phase one finding that the settlement agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet applied to texpet and chevron released texpet and chevron from claims based on collective or diffuse rights arising from texpets operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collectivediffuse rights environmental claims relating to texpets operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm the tribunal held a hearing on april 2930 2014 to address remaining issues relating to phase one and on march 12 2015 it issued a nonbinding decision that the lago agrio plaintiffs complaint on its face includes claims not barred by the settlement agreement between the republic of ecuador and texpet in the same decision the tribunal deferred to phase two remaining issues from phase one including whether the republic of ecuador breached the 1995 settlement agreement and the remedies that are available to chevron and texpet as a result of that breach phase two issues were addressed at a hearing held in april and may 2015 the tribunal has not set a date for phase three the damages phase of the arbitration 

companys rico action   through a series of us court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud collusion corruption and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs in february 2011 chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers consultants and supporters alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws through the civil lawsuit chevron sought relief that included a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable the trial commenced on october 15 2013 and concluded on november 22 2013 on march 4 2014 the federal district court entered a judgment in favor of chevron prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the lago agrio judgment in the united states and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts the defendants appealed the federal district courts decision and on april 20 2015 a panel of the us court of appeals for the second circuit heard oral arguments on august 8 2016 the second circuit issued a unanimous opinion affirming in full the judgment of the federal district court in favor of chevron on october 27 2016 the second circuit denied the defendants petitions for en banc rehearing of the opinion on their appeal on march 27 2017 two of the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court on june 19 2017 the united states supreme court denied the defendants petition for a writ of certiorari 

managements assessment  the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment the 2008 engineer’s report on alleged damages and the september 2010 plaintiffs’ submission on alleged damages management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss

taxes 



the reconciliation between the us statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table 



 includes onetime tax costs benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 

the 2017 decline in income tax benefit of 1681  from a benefit of 1729  in 2016 to a benefit of 48  in 2017 is a result of the yearoveryear increase in total income before income tax expense which is primarily due to effects of higher crude oil prices and gains on asset sales primarily in indonesia and canada in addition the tax benefit for the year includes a provisional benefit of 2020  from us tax reform which primarily reflects the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities the company’s effective tax rate changed from 80 percent  in 2016  to 05 percent  in 2017  the change in effective tax rate is primarily a consequence of the mix effect resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions and the 2017 impact of us tax reform 

as noted above us tax reform resulted in the remeasurement of us deferred tax assets and liabilities the final impact will not be known until the actual 2017 us tax return is submitted in 2018 and this may result in a change to the provisional amounts that have been recognized 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the company records its deferred taxes on a taxjurisdiction basis the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following 



deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2017  decreased by approximately 5700  from yearend 2016  the decrease was primarily related to property plant and equipment temporary differences mainly due to the change in the enacted us tax rate 

deferred tax assets decreased by approximately 2300  in 2017 decreases were mainly due to the change in the enacted us tax rate and primarily impacted asset retirement obligations employee benefits and tax loss carry forwards the decrease was partially reduced by an increase in foreign tax credits arising from earnings in hightax rate international jurisdictions which was substantially offset by valuation allowances 

the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for us foreign tax credit carryforwards tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences it reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are in management’s assessment more likely than not to be realized at the end of 2017  the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately 16102  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately 1379  primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date others expire at various times from 2018  through 2034  us foreign tax credit carryforwards of 11872  will expire between 2018  and 2027  

at december 31 2017  and 2016  deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows 



enactment of us tax reform imposed a onetime us federal tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings indefinitely reinvested abroad which did not have a material impact on the company’s financial results the indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for us state and foreign withholding tax purposes 

us state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately 57300  at december 31 2017  this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business it is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 

uncertain income tax positions  the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” ie a likelihood greater than 50 percent  to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position the term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements interest and penalties are not included 



the increase in unrecognized tax benefits between december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 was primarily due to foreign tax credits associated with the deemed repatriation the increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to these foreign tax credits had no impact on the effective tax rate since the change to the deferred tax asset was fully offset with a change to the valuation allowance the resolution of numerous issues with various tax jurisdictions during the year also impacted the movement from december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 

approximately 81 percent  of the 4828  of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017  would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition 

tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world for the company’s major tax jurisdictions examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december 31 2017  for these jurisdictions the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows united states – 2011  nigeria – 2000  australia – 2006  angola – 2016  and kazakhstan – 2007  

the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution andor closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain however it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits 

on april 21 2017 an adverse decision was issued by the full federal court on australia regarding the interest rate to be applied on certain chevron intercompany loans on august 14 2017 an agreement was reached with the australian taxation office to settle this dispute management believes the agreed terms to be a reasonable resolution of the dispute which did not have a material impact on the 2017 results of the company 

on the consolidated statement of income the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “income tax expense” as of december 31 2017  accruals of 178  for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet compared with accruals of 424  as of yearend 2016  income tax expense benefit associated with interest and penalties was 161  38  and 195  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively

shortterm debt   



redeemable longterm obligations consist primarily of taxexempt variablerate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date 

the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its shortterm debt at december 31 2017  the company had no interest rate swaps on shortterm debt 

at december 31 2017  the company had 10000  in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of shortterm obligations on a longterm basis the credit facilities consist of a 364 day facility which enables borrowing of up to 9575  and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year and a 425   five year facility expiring in december 2020  these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms maintaining levels management believes appropriate any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december 31 2017  

the company classified 10000  and 9000  of shortterm debt as longterm at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year and the company has both the intent and the ability as evidenced by committed credit facilities to refinance them on a longterm basis

accounting for suspended exploratory wells   

the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and b the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired and its costs net of any salvage value would be charged to expense 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended december 31 2017  



 represents property sales 

the following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling 



 certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both 

of the 3395  of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december 31 2017  2257   17  projects is related to projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future the 1138  balance is related to 15  projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development 

the projects for the 1138  referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability a 190   two  projects – undergoing frontend engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years  b 99   one  project – development concept under review by government c 826   seven  projects – development alternatives under review d 23   five  projects – miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended while progress was being made on all 32  projects the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity scale and negotiations associated with the projects more than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years  

the 3395  of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december 31 2017  represents 158  exploratory wells in 32  projects the tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis

the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2017  2016  and 2015  are shown in the table below 



net actuarial losses recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2017  for the company’s us pension international pension and opeb plans are being amortized on a straightline basis over approximately 10  12  and 15  years respectively these amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive

millions of dollars except pershare amounts 

benefits under the plans these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent  of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of plan assets the amount subject to amortization is determined on a planbyplan basis during 2018  the company estimates actuarial losses of 303  30  and 15  will be amortized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for us pension international pension and opeb plans respectively in addition the company estimates an additional 334  will be recognized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2018  related to lumpsum settlement costs from the main us pension plans 

the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs credits recorded in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” at december 31 2017  was approximately 5  and 9  years for us and international pension plans respectively and 9  years for opeb plans during 2018  the company estimates prior service credits costs of 2  11  and 28  will be amortized from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” for us pension international pension and opeb plans respectively 

assumptions  the following weightedaverage assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended december 31 



expected return on plan assets  the company’s estimated longterm rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical assetclass returns an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific assetclass risk factors asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan assetliability studies and the company’s estimated longterm rates of return are consistent with these studies 

for 2017  the company used an expected longterm rate of return of 675 percent  for us pension plan assets which account for 68 percent  of the company’s pension plan assets in 2016  the company used a longterm rate of return of 725 percent  for this plan and in 2015  750 percent  

the marketrelated value of assets of the main us pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three  months preceding the yearend measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from daytoday market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plans market value of assets as of yearend is used in calculating the pension expense 

discount rate  the discount rate assumptions used to determine the us and international pension and opeb plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the companys plans and the yields on highquality bonds the projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main us pension and opeb plans the effective discount rates derived from this analysis at the end of 2017  were 35 percent  for the main us pension plan and 36 percent  for the main us opeb plan the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2016  were 39  and 41 percent  respectively while in 2015  they were 40  and 45 percent  for these plans respectively 

beginning with the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost associated with the companys main us pension and opeb plans under the new method these costs are estimated by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in prior years the service and interest costs were estimated utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year 

other benefit assumptions  assumed health care costtrend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december 31 2017  for the main us opeb plan the assumed health care costtrend rates start with 74 percent  in 2018  and gradually decline to 45 percent  for 2025  and beyond for this measurement at december 31 2016  the assumed health care costtrend rates

started with 69 percent  in 2017  and gradually declined to 45 percent  for 2025  and beyond the annual increase to the companys premedicare medical contributions for the main us plan upon retirement is capped at 4 percent  a 1percentagepoint change in the assumed health care costtrend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans

 the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management 

the company’s us and uk pension plans comprise 90 percent  of the total pension assets both the us and uk plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns to assess the plans’ investment performance longterm asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established 

for the primary us pension plan the companys benefit plan investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges equities 30 – 60 percent  fixed income and cash 20 – 65 percent  real estate 0 – 15 percent  and alternative investments 0 – 15 percent  for the uk pension plan the uk board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines equities 30 – 50  percent fixed income and cash 35 – 70 percent  and real estate 5 – 15  percent the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and illiquidity constraints to mitigate concentration and other risks assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds 

the company does not prefund its opeb obligations 

cash contributions and benefit payments  in 2017  the company contributed 728  and 252  to its us and international pension plans respectively in 2018  the company expects contributions to be approximately 700  to its us plans and 250  to its international pension plans actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns changes in pension obligations regulatory environments tax law changes and other economic factors additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations 

the company anticipates paying opeb benefits of approximately 174  in 2018  151  was paid in 2017  

the following benefit payments which include estimated future service are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years

guarantees   the company has two  guarantees to equity affiliates totaling 1082  of this amount 712  is associated with a financing arrangement with an equity affiliate over the approximate 4 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum amount will be reduced as payments are made by the affiliate the remaining amount of 370  is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate over the approximate 10 year remaining term of this guarantee the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate there are numerous crossindemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee chevron has recorded no liability for either guarantee 

indemnifications in the acquisition of unocal the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997 the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of 200  which had been reached at december 31 2009 under the indemnification agreement after reaching the 200  obligation chevron is solely responsible until april 2022 when the indemnification expires the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997 

although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements   the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to longterm unconditional purchase obligations and commitments including throughput and takeorpay agreements some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements the agreements typically provide goods and services such as pipeline and storage capacity drilling rigs utilities and petroleum products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2018  – 1402  2019  – 1367  2020  – 1027  2021  – 920  2022  – 555  2023 and after – 2566  a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners total payments under the agreements were approximately 1300  in 2017  1300  in 2016  and 1900  in 2015  

environmental  the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws regulations private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances including mtbe by the company or other parties such contingencies may exist for various operating closed and divested sites including but not limited to federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws refineries chemical plants marketing facilities crude oil fields and mining sites 

although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities the amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties these future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity 

chevron’s environmental reserve as of december 31 2017  was 1429  included in this balance was 269  related to remediation activities at approximately 146  sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties any future actions by regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity 

of the remaining yearend 2017  environmental reserves balance of 1160  781  is related to the company’s us downstream operations 38  to its international downstream operations 340  to upstream operations and 1  to other businesses liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both 

the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local regulations no single remediation site at yearend 2017  had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible longlived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing andor method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control this uncertainty about the timing andor method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value recognition of the aro includes 1 the present value of a liability and offsetting asset 2 the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset and 3 the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates 

aros are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream longlived assets have been recognized as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream longlived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation 

the following table indicates the changes to the company’s beforetax asset retirement obligations in 2017  2016  and 2015

summary of net oil and gas reserves   



     

reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves probable and possible the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec and company standards 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate 

proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 

due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available 

proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation the company maintains a reserves advisory committee rac that is chaired by the manager of global reserves an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization the manager of global reserves has more than 30 years’ experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience his experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects and more than 10 years of managing oil and gas 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

reserves processes he has been named a distinguished lecturer by the american association of petroleum geologists and is an active member of the american association of petroleum geologists the sepm society of sedimentary geologists and the society of petroleum engineers 

all rac members are degreed professionals each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering petroleum engineering earth science or finance the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates 

the rac has the following primary responsibilities establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards procedures and technology and maintain the global reserves manual which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves 

during the year the rac is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams major changes are also reviewed with the company’s strategy and planning committee whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews those matters would also be discussed with the board 

rac subteams also conduct indepth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities these reviews include an examination of the provedreserve records and documentation of their compliance with the  global reserves manual   in addition thirdparty engineering consultants are used to supplement the company’s own reserves estimation controls and procedures including through the use of thirdparty audits of selected oil and gas assets 

technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2017 additions to chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies information generated from wells such as well logs wire line sampling production and pressure testing fluid analysis and core analysis was integrated with seismic data regional geologic studies and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir simulation geologic modeling and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates 

proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2017 proved undeveloped reserves totaled 43 billion barrels of oilequivalent boe an increase of 721 million boe from yearend 2016 the increase was due to 736 million boe in extensions and discoveries 366 million boe in revisions 39 million boe in acquisitions and 5 million boe in improved recovery partially offset by the transfer of 419 million boe to proved developed and 6 million boe in sales a major portion of this reserve increase is attributed to the companys activities in the midland and delaware basins 

during 2017 investments totaling approximately 91 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about 01 billion in nonoil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves in asia expenditures during the year totaled approximately 40 billion primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan the united states accounted for about 33 billion related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midland and delaware basins in africa about 07 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria angola and republic of congo development activities in canada were primarily responsible for about 08 billion of expenditures in other americas 

reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines and contractual limitations that dictate production levels 

at yearend 2017 the company held approximately 23 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects in australia approximately 600 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone projects the company completed construction of liquefaction and other facilities to develop this natural gas further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion in africa approximately 400 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos 

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  unaudited 

gas projects in nigeria   affiliates account for about 14 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves with about 10 billion boe that have remained undeveloped for five years or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion   

annually the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances such as changes to development plans regulations or government policies that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates in 2017 increases in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties resulting in proved reserve increases and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects the yearend reserves volumes have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections for 2017 this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped over the past three years the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 32 percent and 38 percent the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period 

proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31 2017  the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends apart from acquisitions the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control such as delays in government permitting partner approvals of development plans changes in oil and gas prices opec constraints geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest 

at december 31 2017  proved reserves for the company were 117 billion boe the company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil condensate natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2015  2016  and 2017  are shown in the table on page 98  the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 99

 noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2015  through 2017  are discussed below and shown in the table above 

revisions in 2015 positive drilling performance at wheatstone and gorgon was responsible for the 974 bcf increase in australia net revisions of 480 bcf in asia were primarily due to improved field performance in thailand and to entitlement effects and improved performance in kazakhstan the majority of the net decrease of 435 bcf in other americas was due to the deferral of the infill drilling and compression projects as well as drilling results in trinidad and tobago the 218 bcf increase for the tco affiliate was due to entitlement effects and improved performance 

in 2016   development activities primarily at wheatstone were responsible for the 853 bcf increase in australia net revisions of 443 bcf in asia were primarily due to improved field performance in china and thailand 

in 2017 reservoir performance and new seismic data in the greater gorgon area were primarily responsible for the 15 tcf increase in australia improved performance in the midland and delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 670 bcf increase in the united states the sonam field in nigeria was primarily responsible for the 184 bcf increase in africa 

extensions and discoveries in 2015 extensions and discoveries of 659 bcf in the united states were primarily in the appalachian region and the midland and delaware basins

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

cyberattacks targeting chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance although chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or assets access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information including intellectual property business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas 

industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 1 8  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs45  

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries in addition changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products   in the years ahead companies in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emissions such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company’s oil and gas resources economically infeasible although the iea’s world energy outlook scenarios anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until 2040 and even ghgconstrained scenarios such as the iea’s 450 case anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company’s products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition 

international agreements eg the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol and national eg carbon tax capandtrade or efficiency standards regional and state legislation eg california ab32 and sb32 low carbon fuel standards and regulatory measures eg the us environmental protection agencys methane performance standards that aim to limit or reduce ghg 

emissions are currently in various stages of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november 2016 and a number of countries are adopting policies to meet their paris agreement goals in the united states the company has been complying with currently implemented programs such as the federal renewable fuel standard program and related volume standards and state regulations such as california ab32 including the capandtrade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations followon legislation to california ab32 known as california sb32 was signed into law in 2016 with effect in 2020 and is currently in the scoping plan phase separately other states and localities have also sought to directly regulate ghg emissions through mechanisms such as for example a carbon tax many of the foregoing are still in a proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative efforts to be repealed or significantly reformed thus even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligations the landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulations will have on the company 

ghg emissionsrelated laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products many of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and potentially private litigation against the company 

consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices additionally the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the company’s financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors such factors include among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emissionsrelated agreements legislation and measures on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property plant and equipment estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity among other things the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales a significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns in some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including physical risks from hurricanes severe storms floods and other forms of severe weather war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic 

materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs42 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries in addition changes in national or state environmental regulations including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products   continued attention to issues concerning ghg emissions and climate change and potential mitigation through legislation and regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

international agreements eg the paris accord and the kyoto protocol and national eg carbon tax capandtrade or efficiency standards regional and state legislation eg californias ab32 or other low carbon fuel standards and regulatory measures eg the us environmental protection agencys methane performance standards to limit or reduce ghg emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation and it is difficult to predict with certainty their timing and outcome these and other ghg emissionsrelated laws and regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbonbased products make the company’s products more expensive and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins ghg emissions including carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those arising from the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

consideration of ghg issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable they are also factored into the company’s longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts these forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climaterelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential ghg emissions laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions 

the ultimate effect of international agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

overview of petroleum industry 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

 item 1a risk factors 

chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected as will its production and proved reserves upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevron utilizes comprehensive risk management systems to assess potential physical and other risks to its assets and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors chevron cannot predict the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs42 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business     the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties in certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries in addition changes in national or state environmental regulations including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products   continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company’s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

overview of petroleum industry   

  

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to 

 

other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

  

  strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk chevron accepts 

 the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

  during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

  for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs39 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties 

  in certain locations governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest 

acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2013  21 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentyone percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2013  

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products   continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

  international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company’s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

  the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for 

 

products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

overview of petroleum industry   

  

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to 

 

other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

  

  strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices   chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices 

  during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources   the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight  chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents nonetheless in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action  the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government 

action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

  for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matters see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on fs40 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure  the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties 

  in certain locations governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2012  21 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia 

 

and kuwait twentyone percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2012  

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products   continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

  international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company’s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

  the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period   in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under 

applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

a list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on pages e4 and e5 as of december 31 2011 chevron had approximately 61000 employees including about 3800 service station employees approximately 30000 employees including about 3500 service station employees or 49 percent were employed in us operations 

 

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

upstream 

 

the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2011 and 2010 by the company and its affiliates worldwide oilequivalent production was 2673 million barrels per day down about three percent from 2010 the decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines maintenancerelated downtime and the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes the startup and rampup of several major capital projects — the perdido project in the us gulf of mexico the expansion at the athabasca oil sands project in canada the frade field in brazil and the platong ii natural gas project in thailand — as well as acquisitions in the marcellus shale partially offset the decrease in net production from 2010 refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2009 — 2011 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

the company estimates its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2012 will be approximately 2680 million barrels per day based on the average brent price of 111 per barrel in 2011 this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec price effects on entitlement volumes changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets weather conditions that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds greaterthanexpected declines in production from mature fields or other disruptions to operations the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 8 for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects

environmental protection 

 

the company designs operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those that may occur chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified by sitespecific risk and impact assessments chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response including postincident remediation 

to complement the company’s capabilities chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives including the marine spill response corporation which operates in us territorial waters and oil spill response ltd osrl which operates globally the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico in addition the company is a member of the subsea well response project swrp swrp’s objective is to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world in late 2011 upon detection of ocean floor oil seeps in the deepwater frade field in brazil chevron rapidly deployed capabilities and processes in coordination with osrl in early 2012 the company rapidly deployed response capabilities to address a natural gas well control incident in nigeria 

 

virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are subject to various us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries these regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to the company’s operations are or are expected to become embedded in the normal costs of conducting business 

 

in 2011 the company’s us capitalized environmental expenditures were 345 million representing about 3 percent of the company’s total consolidated us capital and exploratory expenditures these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new facilities the expenditures relate mostly to air and waterquality projects and activities at the company’s refineries oil and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities for 2012 the company estimates us capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately 410 million the future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements 

 

regulations intended to protect the environment including those intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change continue to evolve legislation regulations and marketbased programs that could affect the company’s operations exist at the international or multinational such as the kyoto protocol and the european union’s emissions trading system national such as the us environmental protection agency’s rules for stricter emission standards and increased renewable fuel content for transportation fuels and regional such as california’s global warming solutions act levels

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices 

 

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry inventory levels production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec weatherrelated damage and disruptions competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices 

during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats and terrorist acts any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight 

 

chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents nonetheless in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

 

the company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure 

 

the company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to cover fully all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss as a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events the company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

 

political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be 

taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the company’s operations export and exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties in other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2011 22 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentytwo percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2011 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

 

international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the company’s exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

 

the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period 

 

in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities however some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain 

 

environmental protection 

 

virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are subject to various us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries these regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its operations are or are expected to become embedded in the normal costs of conducting business 

 

in 2010 the company’s us capitalized environmental expenditures were 639 million representing about 12 percent of the company’s total consolidated us capital and exploratory expenditures these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new facilities the expenditures relate mostly to air and waterquality projects and activities at the company’s refineries oil and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities for 2011 the company estimates us capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be 

approximately 800 million the future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements 

 

environmentalrelated regulations including those intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change continue to evolve for instance in december 2009 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases which found that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such pollution subsequently in 2010 the epa finalized two regulations under the clean air act that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new lightduty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent in november 2010 the agency issued updated guidance on determining the “best available control technologies” bact that would be required to be implemented by certain new and modified stationary source facilities beginning in january 2011 but there remains significant uncertainty regarding the impact of applying bact requirements on a case by case basis finally in two recent settlement agreements the epa agreed to schedules for undertaking additional greenhouse gas rulemakings applicable to utilities and refineries the agency is beginning to develop these new regulations which are scheduled to be effective in may 2012 utilities and november 2012 refineries so it is not possible to predict their impact at this time the epa’s endangerment finding motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards and greenhouse gas permit rule have all been challenged in federal courts and decisions are pending 

 

the epa also finalized its revised renewable fuel standard rfs2 regulations as required by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the regulations require fuel providers to blend increased volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year and establish specific greenhouse gas reduction and feedstock criteria for subcategories of renewable fuel including cellulosic fuel advanced biofuel and biomassbased diesel the specific impacts of this regulation are determined by many factors including fluctuating markets for renewable fuels and epa regulatory decisions on potential waivers of volume requirements 

 

additionally under california’s global warming solutions act enacted in 2006 the california air resources board carb charged with implementing the law has adopted a new lowcarbon fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels the state is behind schedule in completing certain elements of the standard consequently initial carbon intensity reduction requirements are effective as of january 2011 but carb has delayed other aspects of compliance until it completes further updates to the regulation later in the year in december 2010 carb adopted regulations implementing the cap and trade program requirements of the global warming solutions act the first compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012 and ends in december 2014 carb has yet to develop detailed regulations to implement this portion of the act including the determination of how emissions allowances will be allocated and traded during this period the effect of any such regulation on the company’s business is uncertain

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices 

 

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions and geopolitical risk chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process as such an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices 

 

during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes explosions and system failures any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

 

the company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight 

 

chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations chevron has implemented and maintains a system of policies behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents nonetheless in certain situations where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the company’s business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2010 25 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentythree percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2010 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

 

international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation for instance the kyoto protocol and california’s global warming solutions act along with other actual or pending federal state and provincial regulations envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through marketbased regulatory programs technologybased or performancebased standards or a combination of them the company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective including the european union and new zealand 

 

in 2010 the us environmental protection agency epa finalized two regulations under the clean air act that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new lightduty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent in addition the epa recently agreed to develop additional regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from utilities and refineries the agency is beginning to develop these new regulations which are scheduled to be effective in may 2012 utilities and november 2012 refineries so it is not possible to predict their impact at this time 

 

the us congress has previously considered and may in the future consider legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions at this time it is not possible to predict any specific congressional actions in 2011 or beyond and it is unclear how any such legislation would reconcile with the clean air act or current epa regulations 

 

in december 2010 california adopted regulations implementing the cap and trade program requirements of the state’s global warming solutions act also known as ab32 the first compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012 and ends in december 2014 chevron may incur costs associated with emissions reduction activities and the purchase of allowances or credits for its facilities in california in addition chevron’s purchased energy costs from utilities may increase starting in january 2012 when electricity generators are required to purchase allowances or credits for electricity sold in california 

 

these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions the company’s exploration and production of crude oil natural gas and various minerals such as coal the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

 

the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would 

be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period 

 

in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

ecuador 

chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador brought in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 million after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

 

based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations 

 

in 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 189 billion which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and 

pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineer’s report also asserted that an additional 84 billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment in 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome the judge presiding over the case was recused in 2010 chevron moved to strike the mining engineer’s report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineer’s independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct in august 2010 the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineer’s report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement 

 

in september 2010 chevron submitted its position on damages asserting that no amount should be assessed against it the plaintiffs’ submission which relied in part on the mining engineer’s report took the position that damages are between approximately 16 billion and 76 billion and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately 5 billion and 38 billion the next day the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevron’s prior recusal petition and because procedural and evidentiary matters remain unresolved in october 2010 chevron’s motion to recuse the judge was granted a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judge’s order closing the evidentiary phase of the case on december 17 2010 the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment 

 

chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september 2009 against the republic of ecuador before the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law the claim alleges violations of the republic of ecuador’s obligations under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty bit and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet described above which are investment agreements protected by the bit through the arbitration chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of ecuador including a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuador’s obligations under the bit on february 9 2011 the permanent court of arbitration issued an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal chevron expects to continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief before the tribunal 

 

through a series of recent us court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration chevron has obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud collusion corruption and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs in february 2011 chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers consultants and supporters alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws through the civil lawsuit chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable on february 8 2011 the court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case until march 8 2011 chevron’s motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the court 

 

on february 14 2011 the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case the provincial court rejected chevron’s defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion the judgment assesses approximately 86 billion in damages and about 09 billion for the plaintiffs’ representatives it also assesses an additional amount of approximately 86 billion in punitive damages unless the company provides a public apology chevron continues to believe the court’s judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador the united states and other countries the company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence chevron will appeal this decision in ecuador chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in ecuador chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability because chevron has no substantial assets in ecuador chevron would expect enforcement actions as a result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions chevron expects to contest any such actions 

 

the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters including any financial effect on chevron remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects 

associated with the judgment the 2008 engineer’s report and the september 2010 plaintiffs’ submission management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss

summary description of chevron 

 

chevron corporation a delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to us and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations chemicals operations mining operations power generation and energy services exploration and production upstream operations consist of exploring for developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas refining marketing and transportation downstream operations relate to refining crude oil and converting natural gas into finished petroleum products marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum and transporting crude oil natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car chemicals operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant oil additives 

 

a list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on pages e23 and e24 as of december 31 2009 chevron had approximately 64000 employees including about 4000 service station employees approximately 31500 employees including about 3500 service station employees or 49 percent were employed in us operations 

 

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities however some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crudeoil and naturalgas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing and transportation entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

net production of crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 12 

 

 

 

worldwide oilequivalent production including volumes from oil sands refer to footnote 2 above was 27 million barrels per day up about 7 percent from 2008 the increase was mostly associated with the startup of the blind faith and tahiti fields in the us gulf of mexico in late 2008 and the second quarter 2009 respectively the commencement of operations in the third quarter 2008 at the agbami field in nigeria and the expansion at tengiz in kazakhstan refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 20072009 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

the company estimates that its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2010 will be approximately 273 million barrels per day this estimate is subject to many uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec the price effect on production volumes calculated under costrecovery and variableroyalty provisions of certain contracts changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets and production that may have to be shut in due to weather conditions civil unrest 

changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations future production levels also are affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 9 for a discussion of the company’s major crudeoil and naturalgas development projects

some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain the company’s overall investment in this area is not significant to the company’s consolidated financial position 

 

environmental protection 

 

virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are subject to various us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and to similar laws and regulations in other countries these regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations but also the products it sells most of the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its operations are or are expected to become embedded in the normal costs of conducting business 

 

in 2009 the company’s us capitalized environmental expenditures were approximately 887 million representing approximately 15 percent of the company’s total consolidated us capital and exploratory expenditures these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with new 

facilities the expenditures relate mostly to air and waterquality projects and activities at the company’s refineries oil and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities for 2010 the company estimates us capital expenditures for environmental control facilities will be approximately 831 million the future annual capital costs are uncertain and will be governed by several factors including future changes to regulatory requirements 

 

chevron expects an increase in environmentrelated regulations including those that are intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change in the countries where it has operations for instance under california’s global warming solutions act enacted in 2006 the california air resources board carb charged with implementing the law has adopted a new lowcarbon fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels which is expected to apply beginning in 2011 additionally carb is expected to propose regulations to implement the “cap and trade” emissions regulation provisions of the law for adoption in the second half 2010 the effect of any such regulation on the company’s business is uncertain

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices 

 

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions and geopolitical risk 

 

during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refinedproduct sales 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes explosions and system failures any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the company’s business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activities could result in liability arising from private litigation or government action either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors 

 

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2009 26 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentytwo percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2009 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

continued political attention to issues concerning climate change the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the company’s operations and financial results 

 

international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation for instance the kyoto protocol australia’s proposed legislation and california’s global warming solutions act along with other actual or pending federal state and provincial regulations envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through marketbased regulatory programs technologybased or performancebased standards or a combination of them the company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective including the european union and new zealand 

 

in december 2009 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases which specifically found that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare and that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such pollution these findings do not themselves impose regulatory requirements however the agency is currently in the process of promulgating greenhouse gas emission standards for lightduty vehicles and regulations that would require certain stationary source facilities that exceed an asyet undetermined threshold to obtain permits in advance which permits could require implementation of socalled “best available control technologies” in june 2009 the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act this is known as the waxmanmarkey bill which includes provisions for a capandtrade program aimed at controlling and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states at this time it is not possible to predict whether or when the us senate may act on climate change legislation how any bill approved by the senate will be reconciled with the waxmanmarkey legislation or whether any federal legislation will supersede the epa’s regulatory actions 

 

these and other greenhouse gas emissionsrelated laws policies and regulations may result in substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction the company’s activities in it and market conditions the company’s exploration and production of crude oil natural gas and 

various minerals such as coal the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated some of these activities such as consumers’ and customers’ use of the company’s products as well as actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to such laws and regulations are beyond the company’s control 

 

the effect of regulation on the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the sectors covered the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes revenues and margins 

 

changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operations performance in any given period 

 

in preparing the company’s periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 including its financial statements chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date these estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and impairments to property plant and equipment changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the company’s business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador brought in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 million after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

 

based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs 

bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively third that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations 

 

in april 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 8 billion which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineer’s report also asserted that an additional 83 billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment the engineer’s report is not binding on the court chevron also believes that the engineer’s work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law and in violation of the court’s orders chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety in november 2008 the engineer revised the report and without additional evidence recommended an increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to a total of 189 billion and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust enrichment to a total of 84 billion chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report which the court dismissed in september 2009 following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome  the judge presiding over the case petitioned to be recused in late september 2009 the judge was recused and in october 2009 the full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal resulting in the appointment of a new judge chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge but the new judge denied these motions the court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could render a judgment at any time chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability 

 

in the event of an adverse judgment chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously defend against enforcement of any such judgment therefore the ultimate outcome — and any financial effect on chevron — remains uncertain management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the engineer’s report management does not believe the report has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss 

 

government proceedings 

in november 2008 the california air resources board carb proposed a civil penalty against the company’s sacramento california terminal for alleged violations between august and december 2007 of carb’s regulations governing the minimum concentration of additives in gasoline due to a computer programming error the sacramento terminal’s automatic dispensers had failed to inject additive detergent into a gasoline line 

 

in november 2008 carb proposed a civil penalty against the company’s richmond california refinery for a notice of violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to composition the company corrected the composition certificates for the gasoline without requiring any change to the composition of the gasoline in july 2009 carb issued the refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that caused the product composition certifications to be in error the composition certifications were corrected without requiring any change to the gasoline discussions with carb officials relating to all of these matters took place in the fourth quarter 2009 and continue in 2010 

 

in july 2009 the hawaii department of health “doh” alleged that chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding 100000 in conjunction with commitments the company undertook to install and operate certain air pollution abatement equipment at its hawaii refinery pursuant to clean air act settlement with the united states environmental protection agency and doh the company has disputed many of the allegations

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil and natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities however some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part seasonality is not a primary driver to changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing and transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions and geopolitical risk 

 

during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil the company’s upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected upstream assets may also become impaired the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refinedproduct sales 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes and explosions any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the company’s business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants any of these activities could result in liability either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment 

 

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses andor to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2008 29 percent of the company’s net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opecmember countries including angola nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait twentythree percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2008 excluding reserves in indonesia which relinquished its opec membership at the end of 2008 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

management expects continued political attention to issues concerning climate change and the role of human activity in it and potential remediation or mitigation through regulation that could materially affect the company’s operations 

 

international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various phases of discussion or implementation the kyoto protocol california’s global warming solutions act and australia’s proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme along with other actual or pending federal state and provincial regulations envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through marketbased trading schemes the company is currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within the european union 

 

as a result of these and other environmental regulations the company expects to incur substantial capital compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction and the company’s activities in it the company’s production and processing operations eg the production of crude oil at offshore platforms and the processing of natural gas at liquefied natural gas facilities typically result in emission of greenhouse gases likewise emissions arise from power and downstream operations including crude oil transportation and refining finally although beyond the control of the company the use of passenger vehicle fuels and related products by consumers also results in greenhouse gas emissions that may be regulated 

 

the company’s financial performance will depend on a number of factors including among others the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law the price and availability of emission allowances and credits the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowances or need to purchase them in the open market or through auctions and the impact of legislation on the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products material cost increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells to the extent these costs are not ultimately reflected in the price of the company’s products the company’s operating results will be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio ecuador brought in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm plus a health monitoring program until 1992 texaco petroleum company texpet a subsidiary of texaco inc was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador the ecuadorian stateowned oil company as the majority partner since 1990 the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent thirdparty environmental audit of the concession area texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpet’s ownership share of the consortium pursuant to that agreement texpet conducted a threeyear remediation program at a cost of 40 million after certifying that the sites were properly remediated the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations 

 

based on the history described above chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit as to matters of law the company believes first that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron second that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action enacted in 1999 cannot be applied retroactively to chevron third that the claims are barred by the 

statute of limitations in ecuador and fourth that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador with regard to the facts the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations 

 

in april 2008 a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage and to specify steps needed to remediate it issued a report recommending that the court assess 8 billion which would according to the engineer provide financial compensation for purported damages including wrongful death claims and pay for among other items environmental remediation health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador the engineer’s report also asserted that an additional 83 billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment the engineer’s report is not binding on the court chevron also believes that the engineer’s work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law and in violation of the court’s orders chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety in november 2008 the engineer revised the report and without additional evidence recommended an increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to a total of 189 billion and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust enrichment to a total of 84 billion chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report and chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability 

 

management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss can be made in this case due to the defects associated with the engineer’s report management does not believe the report itself has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss moreover the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss or a range of loss

summary description of chevron 

 

chevron corporation 1 a delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to us and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations chemicals operations mining operations power generation and energy services exploration and production upstream operations consist of exploring for developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas refining marketing and transportation downstream operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum products marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum and transporting crude oil natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant oil additives 

 

on august 10 2005 the company acquired unocal corporation unocal an independent oil and gas exploration and production company discussion of the unocal acquisition is in note 2 on page fs34 

 

a list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on pages e4 and e5 as of december 31 2007 chevron had approximately 65000 employees including about 6000 service station employees approximately 31000 or 48 percent of the company’s employees were employed in us operations 

 

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil and natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand for these commodities however some governments impose price controls on refined products such as gasoline or diesel fuel the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part seasonality is not a primary driver to changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing and transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets 

 

 

1 incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001 in 2005 chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation as used in this report the term “chevron” and such terms as “the company” “the corporation” “our” “we” and “us” may refer to chevron corporation one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole but unless stated otherwise it does not include “affiliates” of chevron — ie those companies accounted for by the equity method generally owned 50 percent or less or investments accounted for by the cost method all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies each of which manages its own affairs

chevron strategic direction 

 

chevron’s primary objective is to create value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors as a foundation for achieving this objective the company has established the following strategies 

 

strategies for major businesses 

 

  

the company also continues to invest in renewableenergy technologies with an objective of capturing profitable positions in important renewable sources of energy 

 

enabling strategies companywide 

 

  

  

the upstream downstream and chemicals activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically with operations in north america south america europe africa the middle east asia and australasia tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues earnings and income taxes for the three years ending december 31 2007 and assets as of the end of 2007 and 2006 — for the united states and the company’s international geographic areas — are in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs37 in addition similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property plant and equipment are in notes 11 and 12 on pages fs40 to fs42 

 

capital and exploratory expenditures 

 

total reported expenditures for 2007 were 20 billion including 23 billion for chevron’s share of expenditures by affiliated companies which did not require cash outlays by the company in 2006 and 2005 expenditures were 166 billion and 111 billion respectively including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of 19 billion and 17 billion in the corresponding periods the 2005 amount excludes 173 billion for the acquisition of unocal 

 

of the 20 billion in expenditures for 2007 78 percent or 155 billion related to upstream activities approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in 2006 and 2005 international upstream accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in each of the three years reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities that are available outside the united states 

 

in 2008 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 15 percent higher at 229 billion including 26 billion of spending by affiliates about threefourths of the total or 175 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities with 127 billion of that amount outside the united states

as shown in the table on page 5 worldwide oilequivalent production of 259 million barrels per day in 2007 was up 34000 barrels per day from the prior year worldwide oilequivalent production including “other produced volumes” refer to footnote 5 to the table on page 5 was 262 million barrels per day down about 2 percent from 2006 the decline was mostly attributable to the change in the boscan operating service agreement in venezuela to a jointstock company in october 2006 refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2005–2007 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

the company estimates that its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2008 will be approximately 265 million barrels per day this estimate is subject to many uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec the price effect on production volumes calculated under costrecovery and variableroyalty provisions of certain contracts changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations delays in project startups and production that may have to be shut in due to weather conditions civil unrest changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations future production levels also are affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 9 for a discussion of the company’s major oil and gas development projects

contract obligations 

 

the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities 

 

in the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately 456 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2010 the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed us reserves these contracts include variablepricing terms 

 

outside the united states the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties a total of approximately 631 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2008 through 2010 from argentina australia canada colombia denmark and the philippines the sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery and in some cases consider inflation or other factors the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in argentina australia colombia denmark and the philippines the company plans to meet its canadian contractual delivery commitments of 30 billion cubic feet through thirdparty purchases

chevron’s 2007 key upstream activities some of which are also discussed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page fs2 are presented below the comments include references to “total production” and “net production” which are defined under “production” in exhibit 991 on page e23 

 

the discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant longleadtime projects not yet on production and for projects recently placed on production reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned in addition to the activities discussed chevron was active in other geographic areas but those activities are considered less significant 

consolidated operations 

 

 

 

  

upstream activities in the united states are concentrated in california the gulf of mexico louisiana texas new mexico the rocky mountains and alaska average net oilequivalent production during 2007 was 743000 barrels per day composed of 460000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 17 billion cubic feet of natural gas refer to table v beginning on page fs66 for a discussion of the net proved reserves and different hydrocarbon characteristics for the company’s major us producing areas 

 

 

 

 

 

also under development is the 75 percentowned and operated blind faith discovery in which the company increased its ownership from 63 percent in july 2007 three development wells were drilled and construction of the topsides and hull was completed in 2007 the project includes a subsea development plan with tieback to a semisubmersible floating production facility that had an original dailyproduction design capacity of 45000 barrels of crude oil and 45 million cubic feet of natural gas based on the initial threewell development program a fourth development well and associated facility upgrades are planned to commence in the first half of 2008 the facility upgrades are planned to increase the daily capacity to 60000 barrels of crude oil and 60 million cubic feet of natural gas initial daily total production including the fourth well is estimated at 45000 to 60000 barrels of crude oil and 45 million to 60 million cubic feet of natural gas proved undeveloped reserves for the project were recognized in 2005 reclassification of the reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of production startup in the second quarter 2008 the estimated production life of the field is approximately 20 years 

 

the company is also participating in the ultradeep perdido regional development the project encompasses the installation of a producing host facility to service multiple fields including chevron’s 33 percentowned great white 60 percentowned silvertip and 58 percentowned tobago chevron has a 38 percent interest in the perdido regional host all of these fields and the production facility are partneroperated activities during 2007 included facility construction and development drilling first oil is expected in 2010 with the facility capable of handling 130000 barrels of oilequivalent per day proved undeveloped reserves related to the project were first recorded in 2006 and the phased reclassification of these reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of production startup the project has an expected life of approximately 25 years 

 

deepwater exploration activities in 2007 included participation in 12 exploratory wells — six wildcat and six appraisal exploratory work included the following

at the end of 2007 the company had not yet recognized proved reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above 

 

besides the activities connected with the development and exploration projects in the gulf of mexico area chevron also continued the federal state and local permitting process during 2007 and early 2008 for a proposed natural gas import terminal at casotte landing in jackson county mississippi in february 2007 the company received approval from the federal energy regulatory commission for the proposed terminal the terminal would be located adjacent to the company’s pascagoula refinery and designed to process imported liquefied natural gas lng for distribution to industrial commercial and residential customers in mississippi florida and the northeast the terminal would have an initial natural gas processing capacity of 13 billion cubic feet per day the decision to construct a facility will be timed to align with the company’s lng supply projects

netherlands chevron is the operator and holds interests ranging from 34 percent to 80 percent in nine blocks in the dutch sector of the north sea the company’s daily net production from eight producing fields averaged 3000 barrels of crude oil and 5 million cubic feet of natural gas production startup at the first stage of the ab gas project from block a12 occurred in december 2007 at an initial daily total rate of 60 million cubic feet of natural gas as of early 2008 the second stage of the project was under evaluation 

 

norway at the 8 percentowned and partneroperated draugen field the company’s net production during 2007 was 6000 barrels of oilequivalent per day in the 40 percentowned and partneroperated pl397 seismic survey data was processed in 2007 acquisition of additional seismic data is planned for 2008 exploration activities are expected to continue in 2008 in various license areas 

 

united kingdom the company’s average net oilequivalent production in 2007 from nine offshore fields was 115000 barrels per day composed of 78000 barrels of crude oil and 220 million cubic feet of natural gas most of the 

production was from the 85 percentowned and operated captain field and the 32 percentowned and jointlyoperated britannia field 

 

as of early 2008 development activities were continuing at the britannia satellite fields callanish and brodgar in which chevron holds 17 percent and 25 percent nonoperated working interests respectively production startup from these two fields is expected to occur in late 2008 together these fields are expected to achieve maximum total daily production of 25000 barrels of crude oil and 133 million cubic feet of natural gas several months after both fields start up proved undeveloped reserves were initially recognized in 2000  in 2006 proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified to the proved developed category this project has an expected production life of approximately 15 years 

 

in exploration activities the alder discovery west of the britannia field was being evaluated in early 2008 and is likely to be developed as a tieback to existing infrastructure the company has a 70 percent operated interest in the project which is expected to start up and reach maximum total daily production rates of 9000 barrels of crude oil and 80 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2012 the timing of the initial provedreserves recognition was also under evaluation in early 2008 this project has an expected production life of approximately nine years 

 

at the rosebanklochnagar discovery west of the shetland islands an appraisal program consisting of three wells and a sidetrack was completed in 2007 all four wellbores encountered hydrocarbons and an evaluation for commerciality was under way in early 2008 evaluation continued of a successful natural gas production test at the tormore well that is also in the west of shetlands gas trend during 2007 another successful appraisal well was drilled in the clair phase 2 area 

 

equity affiliate operations 

 

angola in addition to the exploration and producing activities in angola chevron participates in the angola lng project for which the company and partners made a final investment decision at the end of 2007 the lng plant will be designed with a capacity to process 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and will provide a commercial option for angola’s natural gas resources chevron has a 36 percent interest in the angola lng affiliate construction began in early 2008 on the 52 millionmetrictonperyear onshore lng plant that is located in the northern part of the country plant startup is expected in 2012 at the end of 2007 the company made an initial booking of proved natural gas reserves for the producing operations associated with this lng project the life of the lng plant is estimated to be in excess of 20 years 

 

kazakhstan the company holds a 50 percent interest in tengizchevroil tco which is developing the tengiz and korolev crudeoil fields located in western kazakhstan under a 40year concession that expires in 2033 chevron’s net oilequivalent production in 2007 from these fields averaged 176000 barrels per day composed of 144000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 193 million cubic feet of natural gas 

 

tco is undergoing a significant expansion composed of two integrated projects referred to as the second generation plant sgp and sour gas injection sgi at a total combined cost of approximately 72 billion these projects are designed to increase tco’s crudeoil production capacity to 540000 barrels per day during the second half of 2008 

 

sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for treating crude oil and the associated sour gas ie high in sulfur content the sgp design is based on the same conventional technology employed in the existing processing trains proved undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were recognized in 2001 wells were drilled deepened andor completed since 2002 in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to produce volumes required for the new sgp train reserves associated with the project were reclassified to the proved developed category over the next decade ongoing field development is expected to result in the reclassification of additional proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed 

 

sgi involves taking a portion of the sour gas separated from the crudeoil production at the sgp processing train and reinjecting it into the tengiz reservoir chevron expects that sgi will have two key effects first sgi will reduce the sour gas processing capacity required at sgp thereby increasing liquid production capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would otherwise be generated second sgi is expected over time to increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes as the injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces oil toward producing wells the company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the sgi expansion in late 2008 the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about compressor performance associated with injecting highpressure sour gas and subsurface responses to injection 

initial production from the first phase of the sgisgp expansion projects occurred in late 2007 this first phase increased production capacity by 90000 barrels per day to approximately 400000 in january 2008 

 

as of early 2008 essentially all of tco’s production was being exported through the caspian pipeline consortium cpc pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea also in early 2008 cpc was seeking stockholder approval for an expansion to accommodate increased tco volumes beginning in 2009 expanded railcar loading and railexport facilities designed to transport most of the incremental sgisgp production prior to the cpc expansion started operation during 2007 as of early 2008 other alternatives were also being explored to increase export capacity

 item 1a risk factors 

 

chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a diversified business portfolio a strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices 

 

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is crudeoil prices except in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum business chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price changes a significant persistent decline in crudeoil prices may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes and explosions any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the company’s business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants any of these activities could result in liability either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment 

 

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses andor to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2007 26 percent of the company’s proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opec — member countries including angola indonesia nigeria and venezuela twentyeight percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2007 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change and the role of human activity in it will continue with the potential for further regulation that affects the company’s operations although uncertain these developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the products the company sells the company’s production and processing operations eg the production of crude oil at offshore platforms and the processing of natural gas at liquefied natural gas facilities typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases likewise emissions arise from midstream and downstream operations including crude oil transportation and refining finally although beyond the control of the company the use of passenger vehicle fuels and related products by consumers also results in greenhouse gas emissions that may be regulated 

 

international agreements domestic legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various phases of discussion or implementation these include the kyoto protocol proposed federal legislation and current statelevel actions some of the countries in which chevron operates have ratified the kyoto protocol and the company is currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within the european union although resolutions supporting “cap and trade” systems have been introduced in the us congress no bill restricting greenhouse gas emissions has been passed to date 

 

in california the global warming solutions act became effective on january 1 2007 this law caps california’s greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020 directs the air resources board the responsible state agency to determine certain greenhouse gas emissions in and outside california to adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of greenhouse gases delegates to the agency the authority to adopt compliance mechanisms including marketbased approaches and permits a oneyear extension of the targets under extraordinary circumstances related regulatory activity is under way within the california public utilities commission the air resources board and the california energy commission are also in the process of developing a “low carbon fuel standard” for transportation fuels used in california as directed by governor arnold schwarzenegger the company extracts crude oil and natural gas operates refineries and markets and sells gasoline diesel and jet fuel in california the extent to which the state and local agencies’ regulations will affect the company’s california operations was not known as of early 2008

overview of petroleum industry 

 

petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating how companies are structured and where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil and natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these commodities the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part seasonality is not a primary driver to changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year 

 

strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing and transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets 

 

 

1 incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001 in 2005 chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation as used in this report the term “chevron” and such terms as “the company” “the corporation” “our” “we” and “us” may refer to chevron corporation one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole but unless stated otherwise it does not include “affiliates” of chevron — ie those companies accounted for by the equity method generally owned 50 percent or less or investments accounted for by the cost method all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies each of which manages its own affairs

capital and exploratory expenditures 

 

total reported expenditures for 2006 were 166 billion including 19 billion for chevron’s share of expenditures by affiliated companies which did not require cash outlays by the company in 2005 and 2004 expenditures were 111 billion and 83 billion respectively including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of 17 billion and 16 billion in the corresponding periods the 2005 amount excludes the 173 billion acquisition of unocal 

 

of the 166 billion in expenditures for 2006 77 percent or 128 billion related to upstream activities approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in 2005 and 2004 international upstream accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in each of the three years reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities that are available outside the united states 

 

in 2007 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 18 percent higher at 196 billion including 24 billion of spending by affiliates about threefourths or 146 billion is budgeted for exploration and production activities with 106 billion of that amount outside the united states

upstream — exploration and production 

 

the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2006 and 2005 by the company and its affiliates 

 

net production 1 of crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

 

 

  

in 2006 chevron conducted exploration and production operations in the united states and approximately 35 other countries worldwide oilequivalent production of 267 million barrels per day in 2006 including volumes produced from oil sands in canada and production under the boscan operating service agreement in venezuela increased approximately 6 percent from 2005 the increase between periods was mostly attributable to the unocal acquisition refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2004–2006 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

the company estimates that its average worldwide oilequivalent production in 2007 will be approximately 26 million barrels per day this estimate is subject to many uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec the price effect on production volumes calculated under costrecovery and variableroyalty provisions of certain contracts changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations and production that may have to be shut in due to weather conditions civil unrest changing geopolitics or other disruptions to daily operations future production levels also are affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and for new largescale projects the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production expected additions to production capacity in 2008 through 2010 may permit worldwide oilequivalent production levels to increase from 2007 levels refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 9 for a discussion of the company’s major oil and gas development projects

in the gulf of mexico deepwater areas the company’s producing fields during 2006 included 

 

  

the company’s interests in the deepwater typhoon and boris fields were sold during 2006 the production platform at typhoon capsized during hurricane rita in 2005 and was safely converted into an artificial reef prior to the sale 

 

during 2006 chevron was engaged in other development and exploration activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico development work continued at the 58 percentowned and operated tahiti field where production startup is expected in 2008 development drilling commenced in february 2006 and well completion work is expected to be finalized during 2007 initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in 2003 and the transfer of these reserves into the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of production startup with an estimated production life of 30 years tahiti is designed to have a maximum total daily production of 125000 barrels of crude oil and 70 million cubic feet of natural gas 

 

at the 63 percentowned and operated blind faith discovery a subsea development plan utilizing a semisubmersible production system was approved by chevron and its partner in late 2005 at which time the company made its initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves development drilling at blind faith commenced in early 2007 reclassification of the reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of production startup in 2008 initial total daily production rates for the field are estimated at 30000 barrels of crude oil and 30 million cubic feet of natural gas thereafter rising to maximum rates of 40000 barrels of crude oil and 35 million cubic feet of natural gas the expected production life of the field is approximately 20 years 

 

in the fourth quarter 2006 the company announced its decision to participate in the ultradeep perdido regional development in the us gulf of mexico the development encompasses the installation of a producing host facility designed to service multiple fields including chevron’s 33 percentowned great white 60 percentowned silvertip and 58 percentowned tobago chevron has a 38 percent interest in the perdido regional host all of these fields and the production facility are partneroperated first oil is expected to occur by 2010 with the facility capable of handling 130000 barrels of oilequivalent per day the company’s initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in 2006 and the phased reclassification of these reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of production startup the project has an expected life of approximately 25 years 

 

exploration activities in 2006 included the announcement of a discovery early in the year at the 60 percentowned and operated big foot prospect located in walker ridge block 29 a sidetrack well at big foot was completed midyear and encountered the same pay intervals as the discovery well additional appraisal drilling is planned for the first half of 2007 

 

at the 50 percentowned and operated jack discovery in walker ridge block 758 a successful extended production flow test on the jack 2 well was completed in mid2006 additional appraisal drilling is scheduled for the 2007–2008 time frame data evaluation continued in early 2007 at the nearby 41 percentowned and operated saint malo prospect saint malo was discovered in 2003 and an appraisal well was completed in 2004 future appraisal drilling is being planned based on ongoing technical studies that are incorporating additional regional data at the 25 percentowned and nonoperated 2005 knotty head discovery a successful sidetrack well was drilled during 2006 additional appraisal drilling and possible development alternatives were being evaluated in early 2007 at the 30 percentowned and nonoperated tubular bells prospect an appraisal well in 2006 successfully tested the eastern portion of the reservoir structure additional appraisal work is being planned to further delineate the reservoir and to evaluate potential deeper targets plans were in progress in early 2007 at the 22 percentowned and nonoperated puma discovery to complete an inprogress appraisal well and to schedule additional appraisal drilling for 2007 

 

at the end of 2006 the company had not yet recognized proved reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above 

 

besides the activities connected with the development and exploration projects in the gulf of mexico area chevron also moved forward with the federal state and local permitting process for construction of a natural gas import terminal at casotte landing in jackson county mississippi in february 2007 the company received approval from the federal energy regulatory commission to construct the facility the terminal would be located adjacent to the company’s pascagoula refinery and be designed to process imported liquefied natural gas lng for distribution to industrial commercial and residential customers in mississippi florida and the northeast the terminal would have an initial naturalgas processing capacity of 13 billion cubic feet per day a decision to construct the facility will be timed to align with the company’s lng supply projects 

 

the company also has contractual rights to 1 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at the third partyowned sabine pass lng terminal beginning in 2009 also in the sabine pass area the company has up to 1 billion cubic feet per day of pipeline capacity in a new pipeline that will be connected to the sabine pass lng terminal the new pipeline system will provide access to chevron’s sabine and bridgeline pipelines which connect to the henry hub interconnect capacity of 600 million cubic feet per day has also been secured to an existing pipeline the henry hub is the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and is located on the natural gas pipeline system in louisiana henry hub interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines 

 

other us areas outside california and the gulf of mexico the company manages operations in areas of the midcontinent united states that extend from the rockies to southern texas in the piceance basin of northwestern colorado the company drilled 14 tightgas delineation wells during 2006 on the skinner ridge properties development drilling is scheduled to begin in the second quarter 2007 with the delivery of two custombuilt drilling rigs chevron also operates 10 offshore platforms and five producing natural gas fields in alaska’s cook inlet and owns nonoperated production on the north slope during 2006 the company’s operations outside california and the gulf of mexico averaged daily net production of 141000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas 315000 barrels of oilequivalent

tco is undergoing a significant expansion composed of two integrated projects referred to as the second generation plant sgp and sour gas injection sgi at a total combined cost of approximately 6 billion these projects are designed to increase tco’s crude oil production capacity from 300000 barrels per day to between 460000 and 550000 barrels per day in 2008 the actual production level within the estimated range is dependent partially on the effects of the sgi which are discussed below the startup of the sgpsgi project is expected in 2007 

 

sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for treating crude oil and the associated sour gas ie high in sulfur content the sgp design is based on the same conventional technology employed in the existing processing trains proved undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were recognized in 2001 during 2006 55 wells were drilled deepened andor completed in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to generate volumes required for the new sgp train and reserves associated with the project were reclassified to the proved developed category over the next decade ongoing field development is expected to result in the reclassification of additional proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed 

 

sgi involves taking a portion of the sour gas separated from the crude oil production at the sgp processing train and reinjecting it into the tengiz reservoir chevron expects that sgi will have two key effects first sgi will reduce the sour gas processing capacity required at sgp thereby increasing liquid production capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would otherwise be generated second it is expected that over time sgi will increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes as the injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces oil toward producing wells between 2007 and 2008 the company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the sgi expansion the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about compressor performance associated with injecting highpressure sour gas and subsurface responses to injection 

 

essentially all of tco’s production is exported through the caspian pipeline consortium cpc pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea cpc is seeking stockholder approval for an expansion to accommodate increased tco volumes beginning in 2009 during 2006 tco continued the construction of expanded rail car loading and rail export facilities which is expected to be completed by third quarter 2007 as of early 2007 other alternatives were also being explored to increase export capacity prior to expansion of the cpc pipeline 

 

venezuela chevron has a 30 percent interest in the hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located in venezuela’s orinoco belt the crude oil upgrading began in late 2004 in 2005 the facility reached total design capacity of processing and upgrading 190000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil 85 degrees api gravity into 180000 barrels of lighter highervalue crude oil 26 degrees api gravity in 2006 daily net production averaged 36000 barrels of liquids and 8 million cubic feet of natural gas in late february 2007 the president of venezuela issued a decree announcing the government’s intention for the stateowned oil company petróleos de venezuela sa to increase its ownership later this year in all orinoco heavy oil associations including chevron’s 30 percentowned hamaca project to a minimum of 60 percent the impact on chevron from such an action is uncertain but is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations consolidated financial position or liquidity

 item 1a risk factors 

 

chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a diversified business portfolio strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition 

 

chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices 

 

chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility the single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is crude oil prices except in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum business chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price changes a significant persistent decline in crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans 

 

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

 

the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas drilling success ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

 

chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes including hurricanes floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires earthquakes and explosions any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment 

 

chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks 

 

the company produces transports refines and markets materials with potential toxicity and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the company’s business chevron operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants any of these activities could result in liability either as a result of an accidental unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions on the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment 

 

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

 

the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses andor to impose additional taxes or royalties 

 

in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2006 24 percent of the company’s proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opecmember countries including indonesia nigeria and venezuela approximately 25 percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2006 in december 2006 opec admitted angola as a new member effective january 1 2007 oilequivalent reserves at the end of 2006 in angola represented 5 percent of the company’s total 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for chevron’s products 

 

management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change and the role of human activity in it will continue with the potential for further regulation that affects the company’s operations although uncertain these developments could increase costs or reduce 

the demand for the products the company sells the company’s production and processing operations eg the production of crude oil at offshore platforms and the processing of natural gas at liquefied natural gas facilities typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases likewise emissions arise from midstream and downstream operations including crude oil transportation and refining finally although beyond the control of the company the use of passenger vehicle fuels and related products by consumers also results in these emissions 

 

international agreements domestic legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various phases of discussion or implementation these include the kyoto protocol proposed federal legislation and current statelevel actions some of the countries in which chevron operates have ratified the kyoto protocol and the company is currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within the european union although resolutions supporting “cap and trade” systems have been introduced in the us congress no bill restricting greenhouse gas emissions has been passed to date 

 

in california the global warming solutions act became effective on january 1 2007 this law caps california’s greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020 directs the air resources board the responsible state agency to determine greenhouse gas emissions in and outside california to adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of greenhouse gases delegates to the agency the authority to adopt compliance mechanisms including marketbased approaches and permits a oneyear extension of the targets under extraordinary circumstances related regulatory activity is under way within the california public utilities commission the company extracts crude oil and natural gas operates refineries and markets and sells gasoline in california it is not known at this time whether or to what extent the state agencies’ regulations will affect the company’s california operations

overview of petroleum industry 

  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil and natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these commodities the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and worldwide economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part variations in the components of refined products sales due to seasonality are not primary drivers of changes in the company’s overall annual earnings 

  strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas 

 

1 incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001 on may 9 2005 chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation as used in this report the term “chevron” and such terms as “the company” “the corporation” “our” “we” and “us” may refer to chevron corporation one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole but unless stated otherwise it does not include “affiliates” of chevron — ie those companies accounted for by the equity method generally owned 50 percent or less or investments accounted for by the cost method all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies each of which manages its own affairs 

3 leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining marketing and transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets

strategies for major businesses 

 enabling strategies companywide 

 

   the upstream and downstream activities of the company are widely dispersed geographically with operations in north america south america europe africa the middle east central and far east asia and australia besides the large upstream and downstream businesses the company’s other comparatively smaller business segment is chemicals which is conducted by the company’s 50 percentowned affiliate — chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem — and the wholly owned chevron oronite company chevron oronite cpchem has operations in the united states puerto rico singapore china south korea saudi arabia qatar mexico and belgium chevron oronite is a fuel and lubricatingoil additives business that owns and operates facilities in the united states france the netherlands singapore japan and brazil and has equity interests in facilities in india and mexico

capital and exploratory expenditures 

  excluding the 173 billion acquisition of unocal corporation total reported expenditures for 2005 were 111 billion including 17 billion for the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures which did not require cash outlays by the company in 2004 and 2003 expenditures were 83 billion and 74 billion respectively including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of 16 billion and 11 billion in the corresponding periods 

  of the 111 billion in expenditures for 2005 about threefourths or 84 billion related to upstream activities approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in 2004 and 2003 international upstream accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in each of the years reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities that are available outside the united states 

  in 2006 the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 33 percent higher at 148 billion including spending by affiliates about threefourths or 113 billion is again targeted for exploration and production activities with 8 billion of that amount outside the united states

net production 1 of crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

 

  6   in 2005 chevron conducted its exploration and production operations in the united states and approximately 35 other countries worldwide oilequivalent production of approximately 25 million barrels per day in 2005 including volumes produced from oil sands in canada and production under an operating service agreement in venezuela was about the same as in 2004 production in the last five months of 2005 included volumes associated with the properties acquired from unocal however production during the year from the heritagechevron properties declined from their levels in 2004 due mainly to operations that were offline as a result of august and september hurricanes in the gulf of mexico property sales between periods the effect of higher prices on volumes required under costrecovery and variableroyalty provisions of certain contracts and normal field declines refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs7 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2003 — 2005 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

  the company estimates that its average oilequivalent production in 2006 will be in the range of 27 to 28 million barrels per day the additional volumes over the 25 million barrels per day produced in 2005 are attributable mainly to the properties acquired from unocal and new project startups that are expected to help offset normal field declines in existing operations however the company cautions that any future estimate of production is subject to many uncertainties including quotas that may be imposed by opec the price effect on production volumes calculated under costrecovery and variableroyalty provisions of certain contracts the rate of recovery of production being restored in the gulf of mexico following the 2005 hurricanes and production that may have to be shut in due to weather conditions civil unrest changing geopolitics or other disruptions to daily operations expected additions to production capacity in 2007 through 2009 may permit worldwide oilequivalent production levels to increase from levels in 2006 refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 10 for a discussion of the company’s major oil and gas development projects

  kazakhstan the company holds a 50 percent interest in tengizchevroil tco which is developing the tengiz and korolev crude oil fields located in western kazakhstan under a 40year concession that expires in 2033 net production in 2005 averaged 136000 barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 216 million cubic feet of natural gas 

  tco is currently undertaking a significant expansion composed of two integrated projects referred to as the second generation plant sgp and sour gas injection sgi at a total cost of approximately 55 billion these projects are designed to increase tco’s crude oil production capacity by the third quarter 2007 from the current 300000 barrels per day to between 460000 and 550000 barrels the actual production level within the estimated range is dependent partially on the effects of the sgi which are discussed below 

  sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for treating crude oil and the associated sour ie high in sulfur content gas the sgp design is based on the same conventional technology employed in the existing processing trains in addition to new processing capacity sgp involves drilling andor completing 55 production wells in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to generate the volumes required for the new processing train proved undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were recognized in 2001 some of these reserves were reclassified to proved developed in 

23 2005 based upon completion of specified project milestones over the next decade ongoing field development is expected to result in the reclassification of additional proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed 

  sgi involves taking a portion of the rich sour gas separated from the crude oil production at the sgp processing train and reinjecting it into the tengiz reservoir chevron expects that sgi will have two key effects first sgi will reduce the sour gas processing capacity required at sgp thereby increasing liquid production capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would otherwise be generated second over time it is expected that sgi will increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes due to the maintenance of higher reservoir pressure from the gas reinjection between 2007 and 2008 the company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the sgi expansion the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about compressor performance associated with injecting highpressure sour gas and subsurface responses to injection 

  essentially all of tco’s production is exported through the caspian pipeline consortium cpc pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea cpc is working on obtaining shareholder approval for an expansion to fully accommodate increased tco volumes by 2009 during 2005 tco sanctioned the crude export project and awarded commercial contracts which will provide additional export routes utilizing rail transportation to the odessa ukraine marine terminal and to marine terminals in aktau kazakhstan in conjunction with existing cpc capacity the crude export project is expected to provide tco with sufficient capacity to export all tco production including volumes produced by sgi sgp prior to expansion of the cpc pipeline

  chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a diversified business portfolio strong balance sheet and a history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends nevertheless some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s financial results of operations or financial condition

the scope of chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources 

  the company is in an extractive business therefore if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production the company’s business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas drilling success ability to bring long leadtime capital intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties 

the company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors 

  chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions the company’s operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes including hurricanes earthquakes 

31 floods and other forms of severe weather war civil unrest and other political events fires and explosions any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment

political instability could harm chevron’s business 

  the company’s operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates as has occurred in the past actions could be taken by host governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses andor to impose additional taxes or royalties 

  in certain locations host governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s operations those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries at december 31 2005 approximately 23 percent of the company’s proved reserves were located in kazakhstan the company also has significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries opecmember countries including indonesia nigeria and venezuela approximately 22 percent of the company’s net proved reserves including affiliates were located in opec countries at december 31 2005

overview of petroleum industry 

  petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors and individual petroleum companies have little control over some of them governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment have a significant impact on petroleum activities regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limiting their profits directly prices for crude oil and natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these commodities the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and worldwide economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part variations in the components of refined products sales due to seasonality are not primary drivers of changes in the company’s overall annual earnings 

  strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers chevrontexaco competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties in its downstream business chevrontexaco also competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies and other independent refining and marketing entities in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in many national and international markets

chevrontexaco strategic direction 

  chevrontexaco’s primary objective is to achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors the company set a goal to generate the highest total stockholder return based on a combination of stock price appreciation and reinvested dividends among a designated peer group for the fiveyear period 20002004 bp exxonmobil and royal dutch shell – among the world’s largest publicly traded integrated petroleum companies – comprised the company’s designated competitor peer group for this purpose for the five years ending december 31 2004 chevrontexaco tied one other company in the peer group for the highest total stockholder return 

as a foundation for attaining this goal the company had established four key priorities which continue into 2005 

 supporting these four priorities is a focus on 

   the company’s longterm strategies for its largest businesses build on this framework and focus on balancing financial returns and growth the strategies for upstream exploration and production are to grow profitability in core areas build new legacy positions and commercialize the company’s natural gas equity resource base by targeting north american and asian markets the primary strategy for downstream refining marketing and transportation is to continue to improve returns by focusing on areas of market and supply strength 

   the upstream and downstream activities of the company are widely dispersed geographically the company has operations in north america south america europe africa middle east central and far east asia and australia besides the large upstream and downstream businesses the company’s other comparatively smaller business segment is chemicals which is conducted by the company’s 50 percentowned affiliate – chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem – and the wholly owned chevron oronite company chevron oronite cpchem has operations in the united states puerto rico singapore china south korea saudi arabia qatar mexico and belgium chevron oronite is a fuel and lubricatingoil additives business that owns and operates facilities in the united states france the netherlands singapore and japan and has equity interests in facilities in india and mexico

  7 in 2004 chevrontexaco conducted its exploration and production operations in the united states and approximately 25 other countries worldwide oilequivalent production in 2004 including volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement declined approximately 5 percent from 2003 the decline was largely the result of lower production in the united states due to normal field declines property sales and curtailments as a result of damages to producing operations from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in september 2004 international oilequivalent production was down marginally between years refer to the “results of operations” section beginning on page fs6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 20022004 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas 

  for the past six years the company’s worldwide oilequivalent production including the volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement has followed a downward trend production in 2004 was 85 percent of 1998 levels equivalent to an average annual decline rate of about 3 percent for 2005 the company again expects worldwide oilequivalent production to be lower increases internationally in 2005 are not expected to fully offset lower rates in the united states which the company projects will result largely from normal field declines and the absence of production associated with property sales the actual level of worldwide production in 2005 remains uncertain for reasons including the potential for constraints imposed by opec and disruptions caused by weather local civil unrest and other factors production capacity in the 20062008 period may permit the worldwide oilequivalent production level to increase from that expected in 2005 refer to the “review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas” beginning on page 11 for a discussion of the company’s major oil and gas development projects

  tco is currently undertaking a significant expansion composed of two integrated projects referred to as the sour gas injection sgisecond generation project sgp at a total cost in excess of 4 billion the expansion is designed to increase tco’s crude oil production capacity from 298000 barrels per day to between 430000 and 500000 barrels per day by late 2006 depending on the final effects of the sgi 

  sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for treating crude oil and the associated sour gas the sgp design is based on the same conventional technology employed in the existing processing trains in addition to new processing capacity sgp involves drilling andor completing 55 production wells in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to generate the volumes required for the new processing train proved undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were recognized in 2001 some of these reserves were reclassified to proved developed in 2004 based upon completion of certain project milestones over the next decade ongoing field development is expected to result in the maturation of the current proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed 

  sgi involves taking a portion of the rich sour gas separated from the crude oil production at the sgp processing train and reinjecting it into the tengiz and korolev reservoirs chevrontexaco expects that sgi will have two key effects first sgi will reduce the sour gas processing capacity otherwise required at sgp thereby increasing liquid production capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would otherwise be generated second over time it is expected that sgi will increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes due to the maintenance of higher reservoir pressure from the gas reinjection between 2006 and 2008 the company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the sgi expansion the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about compressor performance associated with injecting highpressure sour gas and subsurface responses to injection 

  essentially all of tco’s production is exported through the cpc pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea cpc which is expected to be expanded in stages through the end of 2008 is anticipated to fully accommodate tco expansion volumes by the end of 2007 tco is currently pursuing alternate transportation routes to accommodate expansion volumes prior to the end of 2007 as necessary
